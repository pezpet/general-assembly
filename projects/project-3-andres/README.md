# Executive Summary for Project 3
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to use NLP to correctly predict what subreddit a post is from using text and other features from data collected from reddit using the pushshift API. We will collect posts from the subreddits **r/UnresolvedMysteries** and **r/UnsolvedMysteries** for this project.

We will compare classification metrics for our models to determine which has better performance, as measured by:
- Accuracy


## Description of data

## Conclusions & Recommendations
Allthough our location based models have better RMSEs than our null-baseline model, a straightforward linear regression model that didn't include location features performed better than location only models.

Our recommendation is to incorporate a diverse mix of factors when estimating property prices, including but not limited to location characteristics.
