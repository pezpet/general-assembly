      "Beautiful Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan blessed her parents Jennifer Buchanan and Shane Hinojosa in Monroe, Michigan and changed their lives forever. She was described as a little \"tomboy\" who hated dresses and was very fond of the look and sound motorcycles; She even has a motorcycle on her headstone. One of her favorite movies to watch was \"The Jungle Book\", and it was always on repeat.[(source)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37924376/nevaeh-amyah-buchanan) Nevaeh was described as \"having a smile that would warm the room, a personality that could tame the wildest heart, and a love for life that was only second to her love of family\". She loved preschool and was a great student. Nevaeh had also made a new best friend named Austin; He lived in the same apartment complex as her.\n",

      "It was a warm spring day in Monroe, Michigan and 5-year-old Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan was playing with other children, going into and out of the apartments in Charlotte Arms where she lived with her mother, Jennifer, and her grandmother and legal guardian, Sherry. Around 6:30pm, Nevaeh told her mother that she was going to play with a friend upstairs in the same unit where they lived. Nevaeh was last seen wearing a light blue shirt with red and white horizontal stripes and a white V-neck collar and jean shorts; She was not wearing shoes or socks. When it was time for dinner, a child told Jennifer that Nevaeh had actually been playing outside on her scooter. \"She wasn't supposed to be outside,\" Jennifer Buchanan said. \"She was supposed to be upstairs at a neighbor's playing with her friend at their place.\" [(source)](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/05/grace.coldcase.nevaeh.buchanan/index.html) . She began searching for her around 7pm. The only trace of Nevaeh was her tricycle, sitting abandoned on the edge of the driveway. \n",

      "After an hour of searching, 911 was called and a large-scale search for Nevaeh was ensued, including the K-9 unit and helicopters, as well as officers and volunteers, citizens of Monroe. A nearby quarry was searched by divers and sonar equipment. [(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7697163&amp;page=1) All 180 apartments were searched and residents were questioned. The only possible witness was Tim Finley, who had visited his sister who lived at the complex. He left the apartments around 7pm and he said he hadn't noticed any children playing outside, but did see a \"little red car\" speed out of the complex parking lot.

      "Around 9:30am, two fishermen spent their morning fishing at the River Raisin riverbank near Dixon Road, about 10 miles from Charlotte Arms Apartments. While fishing on the rocks, the fishermen noticed a concrete block. At one point, one of the men stumbled on the concrete and a piece of it gave way, revealing a heartbreaking sight: human remains. Flies immediately swarmed to the exposed skin, and the two fishermen called the police. The clothes matched what Nevaeh was last seen wearing. It didn't take long for body to be identified, but they had to wait for DNA to confirm. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the concrete/cement was not mixed properly. Nevaeh's body floated to the surface of the cement, revealing an imprint of her little body. The cement had also chipped away and crumbled easily. If the cement would have been mixed correctly, her body might have never been found.\n",

      "The autopsy revealed that Nevaeh had died of asphyxiation after finding dirt in her nose, lungs, and windpipe [(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8089505). Manner of death, homicide. [(source)](https://interactive.wtol.com/pdf/BuchananReport.pdf) To make the matter worse, there is a possibility little Nevaeh had been buried face-down in the makeshift cement grave, alive. However, in the autopsy report, it could not be determined whether she was in fact buried alive, or had her face forcibly held down in dirt. Either way, Nevaeh had died by inhaling dirt. Police say there were no signs of abuse and that she had been buried there \"for a while\". Her body was heavily decomposed. There was no mention of sexual abuse in the autopsy report.

      "Around 700 people attended Nevaeh's funeral, expressing their remorse and sorrow for \"Monroe's Little Angel\". “That one little girl was so powerful, she brought the community together,” said the Rev. Dale Hayford. Nevaeh's love for motorcycles was honored immensely. Nine officers on motorcycles led her to her final resting place. Her hearse was pulled by a Harley-Davidson, her favorite kind of motorcycle.  Another 60 motorcycles and 100 cars followed behind. At St. Joseph Cemetary, around 500 mourners looked on her grave site as the funeral director released a white dove into the sky.

      "\n",

      "**The Investigation**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Nevaeh's body would be found, police had already arrested two persons of interest: convicted sex offenders George Kennedy and Roy Lee Smith. Rumors swirled that Jennifer and Kennedy were romantically involved, but she shot these rumors down. However, she did state that Nevaeh did look at Kennedy like a father figure, calling him \"Daddy George\" [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb). Jennifer was introduced to Smith through Kennedy. Even though she was aware of their sex offender statuses, she overlooked them but \"always kept her guard up about that\". With a search warrant, police searched the motel and van where Kennedy resided and found a blood soaked towel and tool, shorts, and photos of a young girl, but nothing to connect him to Nevaeh. (Noteworthy, there are reports that Kennedy did work with cement. There was also a cement company behind where Kennedy was residing). Both men were arrested for violating their probation by being around a child and were never officially named suspects in Nevaeh's disappearance. No evidence was found to suggest their involvement in Nevaeh's murder.  [(source)](https://www.foxnews.com/story/sex-offender-eyed-by-police-was-father-figure-to-missing-girl-says-mother)\n",

      "A woman (her identity was never revealed) had come forward and said that the day before Nevaeh's disappearance, she had seen Nevaeh \"looking at various cars in the parking lot. There was this black car she was trying to deflate from the tires.“ The woman had said she never saw the black car before, and it stayed in the lot until the next day: the day Nevaeh disappeared. According to the article, police received a complaint May 23, 3.2 miles away from Charlotte Arms in Greenwick Commons, about a man driving a black Grand Prix who had revealed his penis to two children asking them \"Have you seen one of these?\". The man was Paul Miller Jr.  Investigators interviewed Miller’s mother and father, \"who told police that his son would wake up in the morning and take a shower and would not return until late at night.

      "It has been 13 years since Nevaeh's kidnapping and murder, and there have been no arrests, no suspects, nothing. Nevaeh's distant cousin Risa Smith has been searching for answers to Nevaeh's case since Day 1. She runs \"Justice for Nevaeh\" on Facebook and has given multiple interviews/quotes. Risa also keeps binders of notes and information regarding her case. \"Smith says the place where Nevaeh's body was not easy to get to, and finds it hard to believe that no one saw anything regarding her disappearance.\" [(source)](https://www.wtol.com/article/news/local/nevaeh-buchanans-body-was-found-11-years-ago-her-murder-is-still-unsolved/512-5838ebb3-83bd-47b3-9759-5a10b0e8d32c).

The lack of consistent information leads to speculation and incorrectness that can jeopardize the investigation and lead to speculation. I tried to keep the information as consistent as possible and cited my sources. I can only hope that I did Nevaeh justice. I wanted to keep this respectful.\n",
