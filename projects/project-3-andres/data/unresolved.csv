I find this subject fascinating, yet I don't know enough about it make an educated decision on my actual opinion on it.

The Panspermia theory is a belief that life on Earth didn't in fact originate here, it came from somewhere in the solar system, some claim it came from comets, others asteroids, and some state Mars.

The original theory actually stems back to the times of the Ancient Greeks.

Don't take this post as I am trying to tell you that life came from the stars, I am not, I am however, interested in peoples opinions who could possibly be better educated on the subject than I am.

Link at the top for a pretty in-depth article on the subject.

Would love to hear the thoughts from anyone who has either researched this particular theory or has a background in a related subject that has covered it as the consensus appears very mixed when trying to look deeper into it.

A man's remains were found by a tour guide in 1998. He was believed to have been between 19 and 35 years old, and most likely somewhere in the middle of that range. He was Caucasian, about 5 feet 10 inches, and likely had rickets as a child. He had likely died 2 years or more before the remains were found.

Several items were found near the body when it was discovered including keys from a 70s-80s Chrysler with a War Amps key tag, a wallet with 'Amity' written in gold letters, and two photos in the wallet, one with an address in Quebec written on the back.

The vehicle that the keys belong to has never been found, the address on the back of the photo did not lead to anything, and DNA and dental records have provided no matches with missing person records.

Police sketches of what the man may have looked like, as well as the items found around the body are included in the article. I was not able to find any information relating to suspected cause of death.",Man's remains found in Banff National Park in 1998. Case remains unsolved to this day despite several unique items found near the body.
2,OuijaBroads,[],1643138751,"**Overview**
In 1899, a piano tuner from Chicago named C. E. Herbert and his wife were staying at the Hotel Emery in Spokane, Washington. The Herberts were *en route* to Chicago from their hometown of San Francisco, a trip intended to allow C. E.’s parents to meet his bride. Because of high water further east, they stayed for a few days in Spokane. Mr. Herbert kept busy during their stay by tuning and polishing pianos around town. 

All was uneventful until he returned to the hotel room one day wearing a suit that his wife had never seen him wear before. When she asked him about it, he said that it was ""well enough to change once in a while to throw people off."" The next day, C. E. left, taking with him all their valuables in a suitcase. He was never seen again. 

**Spokane, 1899**
In its youth, the western town of Spokane was a rowdy, transient, and chaotic place. One of the early hostelries for visitors to Spokane Falls was the Hotel Emery, a two-story brick building downtown that opened in 1892. (If any Spokane folks are reading this, it was at 306 W. Riverside, where the small parking lot next to The Onion is today.) Throughout its lifespan, the Emery appeared regularly in newspapers as the site of brawls, thefts, scams, and scandals: everything from [being cited as the location of adultery in a divorce suit against a state representative](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/86492906/hotel-emery/) to [a falling-out between a scamming clairvoyant and his long-time masseuse companion.](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/93048537/hotel-emery/) 

The Emery was a small hotel, with an office on the ground floor and guest rooms on the second floor of the building. Like many of the more affordable hotels in Spokane at the time, the Emery’s primary clientele was miners, railroad workers, and farmworkers. Newspaper advertisements indicate that it also served as a base of operations for mesmerists, stockbrokers, hypnotists, and practitioners of ""magnetic massage."" It ceased operating as a hotel in 1910, although the hotel's signs stayed up on the exterior for several more years and Spokane residents tended to still refer to the building as the Emery. 

**Mrs. Herbert's Statement: ""He Never Came Back""**
There is only one article about this disappearance in the Spokane newspapers, published on April 19, 1899. Most of the information in it comes verbatim from Mrs. Herbert. (Her first name is not given.) It's a somewhat odd statement that I will replicate in full here:
&gt; ""When he came to town, he wore a beautiful seal brown suit and derby hat to match, and on Thursday I was astonished to see him come in with a black suit on. He said he had swapped his clothes. Then he said, mysterious like, that it was well enough to change once in a while to throw people off. 

&gt;The next day he disappeared, and I haven't heard from him since, although I have visited all the ticket offices, and the police are searching for him. 

&gt;The worst feature of Mr. Herbert's disappearance was that he didn't even leave me a postage stamp. He had $200 of my money, a plain gold ring and a beautiful gold ring set with rubies and pearls, my gold watch, and the trunk that contained all of my wearing apparel, and there was a lot of this, all quite valuable. 

&gt;I have known him for seven years. We were married in San Francisco and lived, I think, at Fourth and Taylor streets, although my memory for addresses is bad. He was a perfect gentleman, scholarly and learned, knew every part of a piano, and we were going to join his parents in Chicago.

Mrs. Herbert moved into the Salvation Army Rescue Mission. Citizens of Spokane collected funds to help Mrs. Herbert return home.

**Whither Herbert?**
There are several factors working against any armchair sleuth who wants to untangle a lesser-known mystery from the late 19th/early 20th century American West. These mid-sized/smaller Western towns often lacked the record-keeping infrastructure that was present in more established Eastern cities. Coordination between law enforcement was also minimal, and information tended to stay in one place. The clairvoyant I mentioned earlier spent most of late 1906 in prison in Spokane and became the star witness against a teenaged axe murderer whose case made national headlines; by early 1907, he was reading palms in Eugene, Oregon and not a single Oregon newspaper said ""hey, isn't this *that* Professor Grant Chesterfield?""

Another challenge is the tendency of this era's newspapers to refer to married women only by the name of their husband, meaning we don't know Mrs. Herbert's first name or even initials. We only have initials for Mr. Herbert. Herbert was common both as a first and last name at the time, and without more information, it seems unwise to assume that any of these Mr. or Mrs. Herberts were the same people who resided at the Emery in 1899. None of the mentions of ""Herbert"" in Spokane papers of 1899 or 1900 are relevant to the case. As a result, this mystery begins and ends with a single article. 

**Missing Information, Unanswered Questions**
I have several questions for Mrs. Herbert including:

- What the heck was your actual government name?

- Why is there no marriage license on record for a C. Herbert in San Francisco or surrounding counties any time from 1890-1899?

- Why was your husband wandering around carrying a small fortune in cash and pawnable items, including your entire wardrobe other than the clothes on your back? Was it normal for him to take all your worldly possessions with him when he left the hotel?

- Was your husband in the habit of making cryptic statements about ""throwing people off,"" or was this a new development? Had he been involved in shady business before? Had he been to Spokane before?

And of course, the larger question asked by the newspaper headline hangs over all of this... **where is Herbert?*

**Theories and Unfounded Speculation**
*Theory 1: Foul play, random or intentional.* 
Stories from this era of Spokane often remind me of Deadwood-- everybody seems to carry a gun, and police officers are few and far between. As John Mulaney once said about bank robbers in the 1920s, as long as you weren't *still there* when the police showed up, you usually got away with it. If Mr. Herbert was looking for fun and/or trouble, there were a lot of places in walking distance where he could have found both: drinking establishments, card games, shooting galleries, ladies of negotiable virtue, vaudeville theaters, and more. The Spokane river was (and is) only two blocks away, and bodies have ended up there plenty of times over the years. Sometimes they're found and identified, sometimes not. 

However, Herbert's odd behavior and comment about throwing people off suggest to me that he was conscious that he was under threat - or wanted to convey the impression that he was. 

As to why Mr. Herbert would do this, I have a few theories: 

*Theory 2: Intentional disappearance*
I keep getting hung up on the fact that when Mr. Herbert left for the final time, he apparently took all of their cash and possessions with them. I can see him deciding to keep their small valuables on his person (plenty of valuables disappeared from Hotel Emery rooms over the years), but why take a trunk full of your wife's entire wardrobe along on a piano tuning visit? Why didn't Mrs. Herbert ask where he was going with all her clothes? How far did he plan on going while dragging a trunk? The first automobile had only arrived in Spokane a year earlier, so it's hard to imagine that he had a ride waiting downstairs. 

Things were clearly not going well for the Herberts financially. They were leaving San Francisco to stay with his parents in Chicago, and the resources that Herbert absconded with represented all of their assets: no vehicle, no house, nothing. $200 in 1899 funds would be around $6700 today: not an amount to take lightly, but not an amount that could sustain a couple indefinitely.

Mrs. Herbert described the $200 as her money, but I wonder when the last time was that she'd actually seen the cash. If Mr. Herbert had gambled it away or spent it on vices, he wouldn't be the first. If he got in over his head and opted to raise some quick funds by pawning his wife's jewelry and clothes, he also wouldn't be the first. (Or the last: see the clairvoyant and masseuse case mentioned above.) 

In this scenario, Mr. Herbert wouldn't have needed to drag the trunk full of clothes around for long. He could have been traveling light, cash in hand, after a quick visit to one of the many pawnshops in the neighborhood. The railroad station was also only a few blocks away. (99% of everything was a only a few blocks away in Spokane in those days, it was not a large town.) Although Mrs. Herbert said that she had checked all the ticket offices, there are many easy explanations for why this wouldn't have helped: it's not like Mr. Herbert would have shown ID to purchase a railroad ticket, and it would also have been easy for him to get a ride out of town with a private citizen and then get a railroad ticket at a station further down the road. For that matter, he could have hitched a ride on the train without paying, as many did. 

If he did ditch Mrs. Herbert intentionally, I suspect it had to do with a secret he didn't want to share. Perhaps some unacknowledged truths were waiting for them in Chicago, or perhaps he had lost all their money and couldn't face her. Or maybe he just was ready to stop being married to her, and decided to divorce her territory-style by simply leaving. 

**Conclusion and discussion questions**
As an old case from a time and place with limited documentation, it's unlikely that many more clues in this case will emerge. Nonetheless, I find it interesting, and I'm curious what others think might have happened to Herbert. Does either theory that I posted make sense to you? Do you have a different theory? What questions would you have posed to Mrs. Herbert, if you were investigating this case? What leads might you have pursued? *Where is Herbert?*

With the media focus across the nation on the events at Ground Zero, the details of [Nicole Parsons Bucki](https://uncovered.com/cases/nicole-parsons-bucki)’s horrific September 11th murder barely saw air time on the local news; a critical tool to get the community’s help in identifying the murderer.

**The day Nicole was killed.** Approximately 72 hours before her death, Nicole was seen arguing with her ex-boyfriend.[ She had bruises all over her, and was allegedly dragged from her apartment building and locked out of her apartment. ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g69kz8NhpqdQxVx6F6ieameefquRmYhn/view)Days following, many of Nicole’s neighbors would report seeing her ex-boyfriend outside of her apartment demanding to be let in to retrieve his belongings. Nicole did not let him into her apartment and the police were called and a no verbal contact order was filed. However, neighbors would later report that within hours of her murder, he was seen trying to gain access to her apartment.

**When she was discovered.** [Just after midnight on September 11, 2001, two of Nicole’s neighbors gained access to her home and discovered her body.](https://uncovered.com/cases/nicole-parsons-bucki/timeline) The police were immediately called. Nicole’s death was initially thought to be a suicide because she was found in her bathtub, fully clothed with a hairdryer connected to a nearby extension cord.

Did the wall-to-wall coverage of the terrorist attacks that day hinder the investigation from a media standpoint in this small town?

**Where the case stands today.**  While Nicole’s ex-boyfriend received multiple charges for domestic violence and violating orders of protection, he has not been directly linked to her murder.

4,ASGfan,[],1643100554," I used to post there somewhat back in the day and it was literally one of the strangest things I've ever encountered. The forum is/was mostly run by a clique of about 5-6 old-time regulars who mostly just talk amongst themselves and ignore everyone else. They would just viciously attack people and spread lies. There were multiple arguments per day and the moderator (cd) would only make the slightest attempt at controlling it.

There was ""Meg"", who I don't think was able to make up her mind on a single case or person. Nothing she said was the least bit believable because she would take both sides of an issue at various points.

Then there was ""kadrmas"", the wannabe defense attorney, who staunchly supported criminals or any obviously guilty party. I'm not even sure if he believed most of what came out of his mouth, I just think he was preparing himself to be a defense attorney, which I'm sure never happened. Also known for getting in arguments on pretty much a daily basis, sometimes multiple daily. Basically his schtick was to say something outrageous, backtrack, apologize -- then lather, rinse, repeat. He was banned for like 6 years, but inexplicably allowed to return and posted for a short time, only to disappear again. He was allowed back on the forum after...wait for it...apologizing to the administrator behind-the-scenes.

""TheCars"" who is a pot stirrer.

Also, the aforementioned former moderator. She tried to play mostly nice upfront, but she really was only in her job for the perks of her position and any time an argument surfaced, she would just try to get people banned because she didn't want to deal with it.

And also ""Justin"" who tried to say everything using the fanciest language possible in an attempt to talk over people's heads and seem smarter than everyone.

And a few other loons (DarkDante, etc).

It used to be somewhat tolerable in the early-mid 2000's, but by the time the late 2000's had surfaced, the place started to get overrun by conspiracy theorists, obsessive fanboys and fangirls and other nuts.

Anyone who spent any considerable length of time there would become familiar with some of the forum's quirks, such as:

The number of pages on some threads going to absurdly huge lengths, most notably the Angela Hammond thread (filled with endless ""Rob did it"" posts), the heated discussions (Jeffrey McDonald), the frequent violation of the ""no youtube links"" rule (which was one of the few apparent rules of the forum) and on an on.

The forum used to be nice and it used to attract a lot of people connected to the cases (family members, etc) but these slowed down to a trickle, perhaps because some of the posters were viciously attacking them.

As time went on, some of the theories became more and more outlandish. Like the one poster who tried to argue that Kari Lynn Nixon (a girl who disappeared from New York State and was later discovered in the general area where she disappeared) really was some girl spotted in a New Kids On The Block video in California and theorized that she was transported to California, kept alive long enough to appear in the music video, then killed and dumped in the area where she vanished. Reading posts like that made my head hurt.

Also, there was a lot of skeevy stuff going on behind the scenes.

I remember reading a post here back in the day from someone who had similar experiences on the forum, thoughts which were echoed by a few others, but I can't seem to be able to find it now. Regardless, I would be curious to know if anyone noticed the same things I noticed.

The forum is kind of an old school forum -- the type that doesn't really exist much anymore. I take a brief look in on the place every now and then just to see what is happening and it seems to have suffered a drop in posting activity, undoubtedly due to people leaving, dying and getting banned.

It used to be a fun, peaceful place to waste a bit of time on and had the perfect amount of posting: not too much that you couldn't keep track of it all, nor too few posts that it seemed boring. Just a decent amount of harmless chatter, but that sort of went out the window once the obsessives found it. It's really kind of sad. It was around in the days before the explosion of true crime popularity that happened during the last decade or so, but really hasn't stood the test of time.

But for those that do, Margaret Kilcoyne is an enigma. She was a brilliant doctor with horn-rimmed glasses. A loner who built her summer home in a secluded corner of the island. A devout Catholic who believed she was facing a spiritual test. A fiercely competitive researcher of hypertension with delusions of grandeur. A fifty-year-old physician with, perhaps, her own undiagnosed psychiatric disorder. But then she was simply the woman who vanished.

The disappearance of Dr. Margaret Mary Kilcoyne on a frigid Nantucket night in January 1980 remains one of the island’s great unsolved mysteries. It is a cold case with no definitive answers or explanations, and it still haunts the Nantucketers who were responsible for finding her. To this day, they don’t agree on what exactly happened to Kilcoyne that night. And the curious circumstances both before and after her disappearance have never fully been explained. “The whole thing, right from the beginning, was strange,” says retired Nantucket Police Department captain George Rezendes, one of the lead investigators of the case. “You’d have to say it was just bizarre from the beginning.”

In July 1979, Glenna Susan “Sue” Sharp alongside her [five children](https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*mWke9zY_2ZMQZ1MZe6rgZQ.jpeg), Tina Sharp, John Sharp, Sheila Sharp, Rick Sharp, and Greg Sharp, were kicked out of their home in Connecticut by her abusive ex-navy husband, James Sharp, after splitting up. They spent the next short while moving across the country visiting family, old friends and neighbours until Sue decided to reside in California to live closer to her brother Don Davis. They rented a 1-bedroom trailer located at the Claremont Trailer Village in Quincy that Don and his wife recently vacated. In November 1980, Sue and her children moved into the much larger 3-bedroom [cabin #28](https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F11%2Fkeddie-murders-cabin-2000s-1.jpg), located at the Sierra Nevada resort in a nearby railroad town named Keddie. At the time they moved into the cabin, Sue’s children, John, Sheila, Tina, Rick, and Greg were aged 15, 14, 12, 10, and 5 respectively, with her being 36. 

Keddie was a particularly run-down location that had been in decline for the past few years, once being a highly successful resort destination that now no longer brought in the crowd it once did. Cabin #28 was much the same: old, dilapidated, and cheap. John took a small unkept room connected to the utility area in the basement downstairs, Rick and Greg shared a room near the front of the cabin, Tina and Sue shared a room near the end of the cabin. Sheila was apparently in Oregon at the time, giving birth to a child that was quickly put up for adoption. She moved in with her family in mid-February 1981 and stayed in the same room as Sue and Tina. The family had primarily been living off social welfare, food stamps, and $250 received from the Navy (due to her ex-husbands status) while she tried to study business at the CETA, a federal education program at the time. Despite all this, everyone enjoyed themselves. They had more space than their previous home, their garden was the forest, and all the children had neighbouring families with similar aged children they could interact with. Everything continued as normal for the next few months, that was until April 11, 1981.

# Murders and discovery

April 11 was a typical Saturday. John and his best friend Dana Wingate (aged 17) were in the nearby town Quincy, Sheila and Tina were over at a neighbouring family’s cabin, the Seabolts’. Sue was at home with Rick, Greg, and one of their friends Justin Smartt (aged 12) who was staying for a sleepover. They all performed their usual activities through the day until it reached night-time. Greg went to bed at roughly 8:30 pm, then Tina around 9:30 pm after she returned from the Seabolt residence, Rick and Justin stayed up till 10:00 pm to watch Love Boat with Sue. John and Dana returned at some point later that night, and Sheila decided to stay over at the Seabolt residence for the night.

At around 7:00 am-8:00 am Sunday morning, April 12, Sheila left the Seabolts’ house and made her way back over to cabin #28. When she entered through the front door, she saw her brother John lying face up covered in blood, another boy (Dana) face down, and another body (Sue) enclosed in a yellow blanket. All three were [bound with medical tape and electric cords](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444499d1366727878-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_019.jpg). Sheila left the house screaming and ran back to the Seabolts’. Sheila and Mrs Seabolt rushed to the nearest working phone over at the landlords’ cabin #25 where they then called the Plumas County Sheriff Office (PSCO). As the PSCO dispatched a car, Sheila, Zonita Seabolt and Zonita’s son, Jamie Seabolt, returned to cabin #28 to locate the rest of the family. After looking through the windows, they saw Greg, Rick, and Justin [sleeping in a bedroom](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444495d1366727877-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_015.jpg). They woke the three by tapping on the window, and Jamie then pulled the three outside through the window to prevent them from seeing the bodies outside their room. Sheila sent Justin home, while Jamie entered the house through the back door that was [left open by the killers](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444496d1366727877-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_016.jpg) to check if anyone was left, potentially contaminating evidence in the process. After a quick and futile search, Jamie left the house and they then all waited outside for the police to arrive. 

The first member of PCSO to arrive was Deputy Hank Klement, who conducted a brief search of the cabin to confirm the murders. At 8:25 am, Sgt. Jerry Shaver arrived and was informed by Klement along with a group of residents outside cabin #28 that a triple homicide had taken place. Klement and Shaver went back inside the house to “review the scene” again. At around 9:30 am, Sheriff Sylvester Doug Thomas and assistant Sheriff Ken Shanks arrived, shortly followed by Officer Don Stoy. At this point, 5 (including 7 if you count Sheila and Jamie) people had been walking around the house, none of which knew how to preserve a crime scene of this nature (supposedly). And it wasn’t until all 5 had surveyed the house did they start taking photographs and collecting evidence. 

Closest and parallel to the door was John. His arms were resting on his abdomen with his wrists tightly wrapped in white cloth medical tape. His ankles were wrapped twice and knotted with one end of a white extension cable. The cable ran across the floor over to Dana, where the other end was [tied around his ankles](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444500d1366727878-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_020.jpg). Dana had a different type of much wider medical tape around his wrists and ankles. Sue had her wrists and ankles bound by the narrower tape loosely, and three different electrical cords all tightly wrapped and knotted around the tape. She was nude from the waist down and had been gagged with her own underwear, which was secured in her mouth with more tape. Her body was also covered in a yellow blanket and sheet, which was later confirmed to have come from Tina’s bed. 

A cheap table steak knife that was used in the murder was found inches to the left of John’s body and had been [bent roughly 30 degrees](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444486d1366727874-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_006.jpg). Another [knife as well as a hammer](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444483d1366727873-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_004.jpg) were found at the scene. Blood splatter indicated that the murders occurred within the confinements of the living room, and initial reports state that all three younger boys had slept through the murders, but this was later contradicted. While they were making these reports, they forgot to notice that Tina was not in the house until several hours after they started. She was then listed as missing.

* [Sue](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444509d1366727882-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_029.jpg) had been stabbed in the chest. Her throat had also been stabbed horizontally, with the knife going through her neck, into her larynx and nicking her spine. On the left side of her head, she had a bruise and imprint that matched the butt of a [Daisy 880 Powerline BB/Pellet rifle](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/1705a582-6415-4123-a76e-69179d9c324b.__CR0,0,970,300_PT0_SX970_V1___.jpg). Sue died from knife wounds and blunt-force trauma.
* [John](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444510d1366727882-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_030.jpg) had the right side of his throat slashed. He also suffered from blunt-force trauma to the right of his head which was caused by a hammer. He had deep bruises on his left eye. John died from knife wounds and blunt-force trauma.
* [Dana](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444511d1366727882-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_031.jpg) had several head injuries such as a laceration on the back-right of his head, and blunt-force trauma right under the laceration that was caused by a different, unknown hammer not recovered at the crime scene. Dana had also been manually strangled to death. Dana died from asphyxiation. 

# Preliminary police investigation

As soon as the investigation began, the inside and out of the house was more thoroughly searched. Tina’s jacket, shoes and a topped-up toolbox had been taken from the house. Blood was found on Tina’s bed, [knife marks](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444498d1366727878-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_018.jpg) were found on multiple walls around the home, a [bloody fingerprint](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444502d1366727879-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_022.jpg) was found inside a door frame and on a railing, and a [footprint](https://www.documentingreality.com/forum/attachments/f237/444504d1366727880-keddie-murders-crime-scene-photos-keddie_murders_023.jpg) was found at the back of the house. The drapes had been closed, the house’s telephone had been taken off the hook and the cord had been cut from the outlet, and there had been no signs of forced entry. Jamie’s remark about the back door being left open was also taken into account. The police strongly suspected at least two killers were there to have control over the family, and that they were in no rush. There were blood pools and splatters in different parts of the living room too, indicating they three were moved around. Sue’s bare feet and one of the boy’s shoes were covered in blood, indicating they were mobile and had stepped in blood before being killed. Detectives made note of a severe lack of fingerprints and other forms of identifiable DNA left at the scene, which led investigators to believe that the killers were prepared and had planned the massacre in advance. Because forensic evidence wasn’t commonly collected until the mid-1980s, any hair, skin cells, and other DNA transfers were not taken from the crime scene.

Neighbours and potential witnesses were also questioned about that night. Sheila and the Seabolt family claimed they heard no commotion coming from the house next to them at any point throughout the night. However, a couple living over in cabin #16 were awakened at 1:15 am by what they described as muffled screaming. Other unnamed neighbours stated that a dog had been barking near cabin #28 and that a porch light had been turned on at around 4:00 am too. Someone else also stated that their cats were distressed that night, pacing around in and out of their house when they usually go right to sleep. Multiple neighbours, including the members of the Seabolt residence noted an unfamiliar green van parked outside the Sharps’ house at around 9:00 pm. Martin Smartt, Justin Smartt’s father made claims that a claw hammer had suddenly gone missing from inside his home, along with many other claims and tips. The problem with this was that the police never told the public that a hammer had been used nor was the one used to hit Dana missing from the crime scene. Because of this, Martin was put at the top of the suspect list and Plumas County Sheriff Sylvester Thomas stated that Martin had been providing “endless clues” in what he heavily believes was an attempt to “throw the suspicion away from him.” Besides all these tips, the police still didn’t have much to go off, that was until they received word of a witness to the crimes, Justin Smartt.

Despite original reports listing Justin as being asleep in the same way as Greg and Rick, Justin’s mother, Marilyn Smartt told police that Justin had potentially witnessed the crimes after he briefly described them to her. Justin gave multiple testimonies about the events with them often conflicting with one another such as him witnessing the murders, only hearing them, or simply dreaming of them. However, when under the influence of hypnosis, Justin was able to provide a detailed, concise, and very plausible description of the events that he is believed to have witnessed. 

According to Justin, he was awoken at some point throughout the night from the sounds of loud noises coming from the living room. When investigating these sounds, he saw Sue talking to two men that he did not recognise. One man had a moustache, short, black, greased hair and stood between 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) to 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m). The other man was clean-shaven, had long, dark blonde hair and stood between 5 feet 11 inches (1.8 m) to 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m). Both men were described as being in their late 20s to early 30s, and both men wore gold-framed sunglasses. Justin said that at that moment, John and Dana returned home and came through the front door. Then an undetermined intense argument broke out between the two boys and the two men, then a fight arose. Justin says Tina came out of her room, supposedly awoken from the commotion and was then immediately taken outside through the back door by one of the men. That was all Justin remembered purportedly.  

Based on Justin’s descriptions, two [composite sketches](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/wGPE8RnlxgDI3xtBWkSdnTW2RcY=/1500x1125/filters:fill(auto,1)/Keddie_murders_suspects-58189b2c5f9b581c0b15fcea.jpg) were developed by Harlan Embry, a man with no experience in forensic sketching. It is still unknown as to why police chose Harlan when they had access to the Justice Department’s and FBI’s top forensic artists. 

Whilst the investigation into the murders was taking place, the FBI was investigating the disappearance of Tina. At the time, the hope was that Tina had run off and hidden out in the forest from the men as she was known to regularly create forts and hideouts in the woods. However, after they couldn’t find her, they started looking at her as a possible abduction. After two weeks on April 29, the FBI “backed off” the case and search as the California State Department of Justice was apparently doing an “adequate job” and “made the FBI’s presence unnecessary.” Police canines were used to search an 8 km (5 miles) radius around the house, but nothing came up until over three years later.

# Tina Sharp found

On April 22, 1984, three years and eleven days after the murders, a bottle collector stumbled across what appeared to be bones. On closer inspection, he discovered the cranium portion of a human skull and part of a mandible right outside Camp Eighteen near Feather Falls in Butte County, a neighbouring area to Keddie. Camp Eighteen was a [167 km (105 miles) drive](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Keddie,+California,+USA/Camp+Eighteen,+CA,+USA/@39.7903374,-121.4069076,10z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x809cfe23912ebb31:0xe4c56f124c348dc!2m2!1d-120.9503435!2d40.0031409!1m5!1m1!1s0x809c937e69e87cdb:0xf3f461769de859f7!2m2!1d-121.16917!2d39.62694) from where Tina went missing in Keddie.

Just after the discovery had been publicly announced, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office received an anonymous call that told them they had just found the remains of Tina Sharp. Even though this call was never documented in the case, they still had made a copy of the call that was found at the bottom of an evidence box in 2013 by a deputy assigned to the case. Soon after the call, the remains were tested by a forensic pathologist and confirmed to be that of Tina in June 1984. Near the area where the remains were found, police discovered other items of interest. They found a blue nylon jacket, a blanket, a pair of Levi Strauss jeans with a removed back pocket, and an empty medical tape dispenser. 

Tina’s discovery brought the Keddie murders case back into the light again and more investigating was done as well as the creation of new and revival of old rumours. Theories about the crimes being ritualistic or related to drug trafficking were dismissed by the Sheriff as he stated there were never any drugs found in the house. Police additionally ruled out the possibility of serial killer’s Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole who had been active in the area. Many people believed that the police did not investigate some promising leads and that they didn’t check or even ignored blatant evidence. But regardless, the case went cold. They had found Tina, and nothing substantial ever came from it. 

# Suspects

Although no one was ever convicted, or even charged for the crime, the police had strong reasons to believe that one pair of suspects were responsible: [Martin Smartt](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*6Y8l27nI2_vglOczd1hXIw.jpeg) and previously unmentioned [John ""Bo"" Boubede](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*KpMIGsolhLIOYKJnez5j6g.jpeg), an ex-convict with multiple robbery and home invasion convictions, plus many associations with the Chicago Outfit mafia. 

When interviewing Martin, he claimed that on the night of the murder, he, his wife, and Bo had stopped by at cabin #28 and invited Sue to go to the bar with them. Sue declined, so they left without her. They left the bar relatively quickly as Martin disliked the music they were playing there and was adamantly complaining about it. When they got home, Marilyn (Martin’s wife) decided to go to bed at 11:00 pm. Despite just leaving, Martin and Bo said they would be going back to the bar for more drinks and then told police they returned home an hour later at approximately midnight. Around 2:00 am, Marylin said she woke up to find the two men burning an unknown item/s in the woodstove. Marylin also claimed Martin “hated Johnny Sharp with a passion”, and Bo felt similar due to John calling him a “punk.” Reports also said Martin was an aggressive man who regularly abused Marylin, and when Marylin talked to Sue about this, he seemingly went “ballistic”. Bo had repeatedly lied to residents of Keddie telling them that he was a police officer, and when someone in the sheriff’s department allegedly tipped off Martin and Bo that they had become suspects, they both quickly left California.

In a 2008 documentary regarding the murders, Marylin claims that she genuinely believes Martin and Bo were responsible for the murders. However, in the same documentary, Sheriff Doug Thomas said that he had already done a polygraph test on Martin and that he had passed successfully. 

In 2016, an article was published by The Sacramental Bee (a credible Californian newspaper) states that when Martin left his family after the murders, he went to Reno, Nevada. Shortly after arriving, he sent a letter to Marylin that covered struggles in their relationship. The letter concluded with: “[I’ve paid the price of your love &amp; now that I’ve bought it with four people’s lives, you tell me we are through. Great! What else do you want!](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*_-4rmt5AoHr939uXOa43fQ.jpeg)” The letter was disregarded by the police and not admitted as evidence. A counsellor that Martin regularly visited alleged that he admitted to the murders of Sue and Tina but said he “didn’t have anything to do with the boys.” He allegedly said he killed Tina to prevent her from identifying him as she had “witnessed the whole thing.” 

&amp;#x200B;

* Martin Smartt died from cancer in Portland, Oregon, in June 2000.
* John “Bo” Boubede died in Chicago in 1988.
* Cabin #28 was demolished in 2004.

# Further developments

On March 24, 2016, a hammer was discovered at the bottom of a local pond in Keddie. The hammer was identical to the one that Martin claimed to have lost nearly 35 years prior. The hammer was taken into evidence by Plumas County Special Investigator Mike Gamberg. Plumas County Sheriff Hagwood who was sixteen at the time of the murders and was a personal friend with the Sharp family publicly stated: “The location it was found… it would have intentionally been put there. It would not have been accidentally misplaced.” Gamberg also stated that at that time, they were examining six unnamed suspects.

In April 2018, Gamberg stated that they had managed to recover DNA from a single piece of medical tape at the crime scene and that the DNA positively matched that of a known living suspect.

No new information surrounding the Keddie murders has been publicly shared since. 

# Summary/tl;dr

Mother of five is kicked out of her home by abusive father, the family of six eventually find themselves living in cabin #28 in a resort in Keddie, California. On April 11, 1981, oldest daughter Sheila stays over at neighbour’s house whilst another stays over at hers. When she returns home the next morning, she finds her elder brother, his friend, and her mother murdered while her two younger brothers and their friend are asleep in bed. Three murder weapons are located, a fourth is missing. Turns out the younger brothers’ friend, Justin, witnessed the murders and tell police what the two killers look like. Also turns out Sheila’s younger sister is missing, who is found dead 3 years later roughly 100 miles away from home. Police suspect the killers were Justin’s father, Martin, and his ex-convict friend, John “Bo” Boubede. Over the years more people, particularly Martin’s wife, talk about how they also think it was Martin and Bo who murdered them. Police can never prove they did it, and Martin and Bo eventually die. Nearly 35 years after the murders, the missing murder weapon is found in a pond. Another two years later, police announce they have discovered one of the killers’ DNA on some tape in the house and have linked it to a known living suspect.

 [What Happened to Jubilee 'Maile' Lum and WHY is Her Case STILL Cold??? | Cabernet &amp; True Crime - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZZLQFQzNog&amp;t=231s)  (This is my video if you want to watch it, but you definitely don't have to. Below is my synopsis of what happened)

 \*\*\*\*

I found Jubilee Lum’s case on uncovered.com. If you’re not a member or have never used it before, I highly recommend. In the realm of solving cold cases, it’s a huge, crowdsourced community with discussion boards, and there’s even a free membership option. 

While perusing Uncovered, Jubilee Lum’s case stood out to me. I’m not sure if it was her smile, where it took place, or the fact that this horrific crime never got any national attention, that a crime in Hawaii seems so foreign and just… odd. I was drawn to her. So, I started compiling clues.   [Murdered: Jubilee Lum (uncovered.com)](https://uncovered.com/cases/jubilee-lum)

Jubilee Lum was born November 26th, 1977.  At the time of her death, she lived with her family in Kalihi, a neighborhood on the island of O’ahu. I’m not exactly sure where she lived in Kalihi, but the area directly butts up to Honolulu, for reference. At 13, Maile was known to frequent Honolulu’s Chinatown, which is located on the western bit of downtown Honolulu. (Which, isn’t too far out of the realm, odds are, she could have walked.) Chinatown, at the time (and even still) is known for being a particularly bad area. Even on the Hawaii-guide.com website, it is still mentioned even to this day that “many areas are still considered unsafe after dark.”   [Chinatown | Oahu Hawaii (hawaii-guide.com)](https://www.hawaii-guide.com/oahu/sights/chinatown) 

Unfortunately for Maile, hanging around Chinatown, and the crowd associated with that area, possibly got her in trouble over the years. But shortly after Maile’s 21st birthday, her family thought she was changing her ways. She had a fiancé, Ambrocio Lazaro, they were planning their wedding for Maile’s 22nd birthday, which was at the end of November, and in January of 1999, she had started attending adult education classes. Even though she was cleaning up, she still couldn’t keep out of Chinatown, but usually her fiancé would bring her back home after she had gone out—it was mentioned that he did this on multiple occasions. On August 23rd, 1999, Maile Lum got into a van, a white/light colored Ford Econoline (an older model, even for the time, 1987-1990 model-there's pictures of it on uncovered). An interesting point to mention is that the Honlulu-Star News reported that there were only a handful of such vans on the island of O’ahu. The next day, August 24th, Mi-Lee’s nude body was found inside plastic trash bags next to a dumpster near the parking lot of Beretania Florists. The trash bags used to hold the body had been thrown out by the Florist, most likely the day before. The body itself had to have been placed there between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM, an employee spotted the plastic bag that contained Mi-lee in front of the dumpster while they were taking out the trash. A purple and turquoise truck was seen pulling away, but it’s unsure whether or not they were involved in the crime at all. An autopsy provided some information—that Maile had been strangled or suffocated, and that she happened to be four months pregnant. 

According to several sources, Maile’s mother, Leilani Casper, (in some articles, called Melva) had known she was pregnant, and according to her, Maile said she wasn’t sure who the baby’s father was. That’s also just word of mouth from the mother. I don’t know if there was ever any type of testing done. 

And I know, like, right now, you’re thinking it was the fiancé. Sources said that he was in the hospital on Sunday for heart trouble and had spent Monday trying to contact Lum. On Monday, Maile was seen getting into the van, By Tuesday her body was discovered. Which certainly means he could have done it (and had the time to do it), but I don’t think he was ever considered to be a suspect, by the police or Maile’s family. There has to be something going on behind the scenes there that we aren’t privy to, and that’s obviously OK. Honestly, at this point, if the family didn’t suspect Ambrocio they must’ve had a good reason. (Since expecting the significant other is obviously the gut reaction)

It was suspected, by several accounts, the Maile was into sex work, and other risky behavior, like drug use, although she had no adult arrest record. (I read in some article that in her youth, she had been arrested 3 times for counts of prostitution). And, while we don’t judge people’s career choices here, it is a high possibility that her vocation and interests may have caused her death. (I recognize the thin line between victim-blaming and taking accountability for one's actions.)

During the investigation, a man named Rod “Shadow” King contacted police. At the time, he was serving time in a California prison for charges of ‘Promoting Prostitution’. He was a pimp. He provided some information, that he knew that Maile Lum was working for an escort service in Hawaii called “Petite Pleasures” (don’t google it, or you know, go for it. But what you think you’ll get is exactly what you’ll receive). King had known Maile for seven months, saying that he knew she answered the phones for the establishment. (Answering phones for an escort service does NOT equal sex work. And honestly, that might’ve been all she had done, as stated she had no adult arrest records for being a sex worker or anything.)

Weirdly enough, King mentioned that he had known someone else that was murdered, and it was actually she he was informing the police about. Michelle Anne Bensinger’s body had been found a few weeks earlier, on August 10th, 1999. King had known Bensinger for four years, she ran the services at Petite Pleasures. Two women, who had to have known each other, were killed so closely to one another. Before this, police had toyed with the idea that the murders may be connected, and though they never officially connected them, the similarities were a little hard to deny. And I really do find that fascinating, that the police were so against connecting these two crimes, when obviously the two women had to have known each other. They worked at the same place, which I would assume, isn’t exactly a huge booming corporate establishment. It’s definitely not like a huge company campus or anything. Also, if Michelle were running the services and Maile was running the phones…. it’s kind of a no brainer. I’ll get into this a little more later.

Anyway, King’s motivation for calling the police was that “Michelle would have done the same thing for him.” Which I found really sweet. 

The timeline here is interesting- King was arrested on February 2nd, 1999. He got a letter from her (I would assume some time in August, I’m not sure about the average mail times for Hawaii-California post in 1999) that was dated July 23rd, saying that she (Michelle) was in a love triangle, but the situation caused her great alarm. She was scared. On August 10th, Michelle’s body was found on Kaukonahua road in Waialua (O'ahu, Hawaii). Based on the decomposition, it was determined that her body had most likely been there for around 2 weeks. Isn’t that timeline just a tad bit suspicious? She reaches out to, what I would presume, is a good friend out of fear, and a few days later her body is dumped. 

A piece of information that I find is a glaring red flag in this case is that Michelle’s death is never ruled as a homicide. Police called it a “Suspicious Unattended Death”—or, I’ve read in another article, it was simply listed as “sudden” \[?!\] not declaring something as a homicide immediately is strange. “Suspicious unattended death is a phrase could be determined by 1) A patient who died while seriously ill, but not under the immediate supervision of a physician or medical staff. No, 2) A significantly ill person who passed away more than a certain time period (days, weeks or months) since their last interaction with their physician, no. 3) A person who passed away under suspicious circumstances. My question is…. what kind of motive would there be for not just calling it a homicide? Her nude, decomposed body was found along a “Cane Haul Road”. Her body was in a remote area. Another thing that I find particularly wild, is that the newspapers never really call Maile out for her past, they mention that, you know, she had maybe participated in sex work and frequented Chinatown, but they always play up that she was turning her life around and was attending classes and that she was pregnant. Everything that I have seen about Michelle points out that she was a sex worker who had 14 prior criminal convictions in Hawaii—which included prostitution and trespassing. I think police spent too much time trying to villainize Michelle instead of looking into why she was killed. Even her CURRENT missing person profile lists her background as “AKA Melissa Ann Sormanti, she was a Waikiki prostitute with seven convictions for prostitution, plus seven other criminal convictions.” How is anyone going to help solve this cold case with a bland description like that. How is that helping, also, how is it relevant? 

It wasn’t until King’s conversation that, in my opinion, the police began considering the possibility that these could be related, started considering the similarities--- Vocation, Age, How the body was found, they both worked in the same area and frequented Chinatown. In the missing person's report, it states that her car was found abandoned on Kunia Road—WHICH IS BY HONOLULU.

[Clipping from Honolulu Star-Bulletin - Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/86299551/honolulu-star-bulletin/)

Why I think this still remains unsolved/Why it wasn’t solved to begin with:

1) Right off the rip, I believe these cases were ignored because of the women’s presumed line of work.

2) 36 people were killed on the island of O’ahu in 1999, which is doubled from 1998’s total of 17 (which was O’ahu’s lowest homicide count in thirty years).

3) Tying into number 2, On November 2nd, 1999, the Xerox killings occurred. This tragedy absolutely got national media attention and I think the pressure from media had police managing this crisis over solving other crimes. Which, makes sense, as this is the most violent and deadly mass murder in the history of the state of Hawaii. 

\-  Speaking of which, As I said before 36 people were killed on O’ahu in 1999. If you subtract the 7 people who were killed in the xerox killings, leaves 31 homicides, which all took place in the second half of the year. This averages to one new homicide case every week on the island. 

4) I want to know why or how this van wasn’t looked into more. It was mentioned that there aren’t that many of these vans on the island. I would figure, it would be kind of difficult to magically get a van—this specific one—onto or off the island without some type of record of it. Based off the articles the owner of the van was never found. But why? Wouldn’t it warrant some type of questioning?

5) I’m not sure what type of evidence was left behind. There may have been little to none, and with the case still open, unfortunately that’s not information I have any access to. 

6) Was the unborn child DNA tested? Does the DNA match the fiancé? If it does, well and good. If it didn’t though, it might tell us something about whether or not she was involved in the love triangle? If she had a secret lover that could have been mad about her marrying Ambrocio? The DNA could be used somehow to maybe acquire another witness/suspect in these crimes. 

I sit here and I am so curious as to WHAT HAPPENED. I feel like there's enough evidence to warrant some kind of search but yet this crime still goes unsolved. 

There was another grouping of murders that happened on a different Hawaii island in 2000. For a minute, I think police were trying to link the 1999 murders with these, but the MO was different. (All the 2000 females had been sexually assaulted and died by stabbing, where I don't believe Maile or Michelle were SA and their cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation of some sort).

I'm interested to know your thoughts and opinions.

11,MayhemInTheDesert,[],1642995600,"Linda Jenkins, a 33-year-old mother of two young children that was described as a dependable employee at a downtown Vegas clothing store, was out at a bar with a friend on the night of September 7, 1979, when she caught a man rummaging through her purse.  Investigators later speculated that the unknown man was short on cash and sought the solution to his problem in Jenkins’ purse.

For some reason or another, Jenkins and her friend continued drinking with the sticky-fingered stranger and proceeded to the 101 Club before ending up at the Sky Club at 4015 North Nellis Boulevard.  After sharing more drinks with their new companion – who witnesses later said went by “Al” – he accompanied Jenkins as she drove her friend home.

Linda Jenkins would never be seen alive again after pulling her 1972 Ford Maverick away from her friend’s house at around 3:00 a.m. with Al sitting beside her in the passenger seat. 

Only a few days after her body was located, airport workers at Lindbergh Field in San Diego making a regular check of cars parked at the lot discovered Jenkins’ abandoned vehicle on October 1, 1979.  The car had been parked at the lot since September 9, 1979.  Investigators believe Jenkins was murdered by Al inside her vehicle while driving toward San Diego, though news reports we looked at did not indicate the manner of death.

A few weeks after Jenkins went missing, another woman would disappear after leaving a Las Vegas bar.  22-year-old Sheila Griffith had recently moved to Vegas from Oklahoma and was staying with her sister in North Las Vegas.  

Griffith and her sister went out to the Silver Nugget Casino for a few drinks on the evening of September 23, 1979.  The sisters left the Silver Nugget together, but Griffith returned to the casino by herself later that night for dinner.  Griffith was last seen alive leaving the Silver Nugget with a man described as white, about 5’7 – 5’9, between the ages of 26 and 30, with a medium build and brown hair.

Griffith’s 1972 Plymouth Satellite would later be found torched behind a hotel in the commercial district of Eloy, Arizona on September 30, 1979.  While Griffith’s body was not located in the vehicle, detectives were able to determine that a toolbox had been taken from the car.  Police believe the suspect was unfamiliar with the area, otherwise he would have disposed of the vehicle in the desert rather than a busy commercial center.

The search for Griffith would end on November 27, 1979.  A hunter scouring for rabbits instead found a nude female body wrapped in a sleeping bag located in a ravine about half-mile from Whiskey Pete’s Casino near the Nevada-California state line.  Though several teeth were missing from the remains, police were able to positively identify the body as that of Sheila Griffith.  The medical examiner determined that Griffith had been at her resting site for “some time” before being found.  The cause of death was eventually determined to be strangulation.

An article appeared in December of 1984 in the Las Vegas Review-Journal detailing cases that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department detectives believed were the likely work of serial killers.  Among the cases mentioned was that of Linda Jenkins, and to date no one has been charged in relation to her murder.

We could find no links outside of local Vegas press reports about the Jenkins murder.  The link below is to articles that appeared in the Las Vegas Review-Journal between 1979 and 1984 (exact dates and page citations included in comment to the link) about the Jenkins murder:

12,alysoncamus,[],1642988662,"I don't know if it is allowed, because I am posting a link to my own book. So feel free to remove it if it's not appropriate. However, I am posting this here because I have read a few threads on the subject of Elliott Smith's death in the past and I wrote a book to gather my research about the case. I have talked to many people, including a close family member, the coroner, forensic experts and the detectives (one of them is still in charge of the case). 

I certainly do not pretend to have solved the case (so the title) but I wanted to, at least, bring some light on a case that has obviously been neglected by the police. The case is still open to this day and will probably stay open forever, unless a confession (if it was indeed murder). I wanted to change the tiresome narrative of the depressed singer songwriter who killed himself, because contrarily to other cases, there are excellent reasons to be really suspicious. I repeat, the case is still open

Here is a short summary of the case, but I can say much more if anyone is interested:

""In the early 2000s, Elliott Smith was a rising Indie music star, a multi-instrumentalist with a drug habit and a dark outlook on life. His music conveyed the depths of his pain and the heights of his hope. When he died in 2003 of an apparent suicide, the media and his fans were ready to believe. As the facts came out, however, the events of that day weren’t so clear. His girlfriend publicly claimed she and Elliott had had a heated argument, and while she had locked herself in the bathroom, Elliott had stabbed himself twice in the chest, an apparent suicide. A few hours later, he died in the hospital of his wounds. The Los Angeles County Coroner, upon examining the evidence, wasn’t ready to rule on the cause of death. Eighteen years later, the case remains open.""

13,Afraid-Emotion-5102,[],1642984565,"Ciara Breens story (missing since Thursday 13th February 1997) is linked to the so called ""Vanishing triangle"", but like a number of those cases, there is little, if anything to connect her case to others, other than she was female, is missing and is suspected to have been 
murdered.

It also seems that the alleged suspected prime suspect was known to her.

Ciara breen was 17 at the time of her disappearance, just about a month shy of her 18th birthday.
Ciara grew up in Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland, and lived with her mother Bernadette (her parents separated and he moved to America).

Going from info I've gleamed from a Barry Cummins book, at the time of her disappearance, she was doing a course for school leavers, and seemed to be getting on well.

The same Barry Cummins book mentions that Ciara was 16, her mother was quoted as saying that she had a bit of difficulty in controlling her, and she would go AWOL at times, and was hanging around with a ""rough crew"", but had settled down when she turned 17, and mother and daughter were getting on well.

On the 12th February, 1997, the evening before her disappearance, Ciara and her mother watched tv/film together, and went to bed around midnight - her ma had to go for a health check up in Dublin the next day.
Bernadette got up at around 2am on the 13th February 1997, and looked into Ciaras bedroom - she wasn't there, the bedroom window was open - she presumed she had sneaked out to see a friend/boyfriend.

By daylight she hadn't returned, later that day, after Bernadettes appointment, she still hadn't turned up, and the alarm was raised.

Police made several enquiries, and it seemed that they generally led to one person - allegedly a man in his early to mid 30s at the time, and lived not too far from Ciara.
Ciaras mum knew this same suspect, in the same Barry Cummins book she stated that she once had to chase him away from the house, as he was trying to chat with Ciara, when she was 16.

It was kind of speculated that the ""rough crew"" that Ciara knew, the suspect frequented this group of people.

Tragically there has been no sign of her ever since. The Garda Siochana received information in the form of two letters indicating that her body was dumped in a Balmers bog, Dundalk (the rough area of this bog lies between Dundalk railway line and the Dublin Road that passed through the town, close to the Ardee Road).

The bog was searched by the Gardai and the Irish Army in 2015, but no trace of her was found ( on a side note it seemed they found a bomb making equipment in the bog), and it was reported that the bog had been partially filled in, making it more difficult to find her.

The suspect was questioned more than once, and a file was sent to the director of Public Prosecutions, but it was decided that not enough evidence was there to proceed with a prosecution.

The chief suspect died in custody 2017, after being arrested for some kind of drink driving/driving under the influence. 

Going by reports, it seems that he had ingested drugs, and when he was found in his holding cell unresponsive, they tried to revive him, but were unable to do so.

I found some news reports on Facebook, and there were a few ""innocent until proven guilty"" comments on one of the articles make of that what you will.
A year later Ciaras mother died.
There's still speculation out there that others know more,

I came across a video on YouTube, some ""ghost - rod diviner/radio guy"" - sounded like hocum (surprised he didn't get chased whilst being on private property)- this guy claimed to ""communicate with her"" and claimed she wasn't in the bog, but didn't offer any ideas up where she was, and claimed she had been in some barn near to the bog.

That's the pity with these kind of cases, you get people who will latch onto them.
I just hope that her wider family circle get some closure.

14,FogHorn650,[],1642977366,"On July 30th 1946 Walter Barton, a Rancher from Tulare County, discovered a bullet riddled body on the side of the road. The body was located a half mile east along Highway 99 near the small town of Traver, California. Traver’s population has hovered around 700 since the year 2000. Earlier census data is unavailable, however historical newspaper articles indicate that Traver never exceeded 1,000 occupants in its history. Traver is 30 miles Southeast of Fresno and about 200 miles south and southeast of Sacramento and San Francisco respectively. Los Angeles is 200 miles south of Traver. It has been primarily an agricultural town since its inception. Tulare county authorities arrived to find a male who would've stood at 5’7 and weighted about 155 pounds. He was dressed in military trousers and standard GI clothing. His boots were neatly placed besides his body, and a towel placed under his head. He had been shot three times. Twice in the head, and potentially once in the hand. All forms of identification had been removed from his wallet and uniform. It was evident to officers at the scene that a Lieutenant's insignia had been removed from his clothing. A country squirrel eradication employee who had been working in the area at the time approached officers and said that he had been along that section of Highway at 2:10 pm and had not seen the man. Rancher Walter Barton estimated he found the body at around 3 pm but had to travel a short distance in order to contact authorities. It is assumed that the body was left along the road at some point during this 50 minute interval. 

Upon further inspection of the body, laundry marks signed PCF were discovered on various articles of clothing. This was the first potential break in the case. The towel placed under the victim's head was traced to Midland, Texas. Authorities contacted hotels in the area and asked them to check their recent registry for names matching these initials. It was discovered that a soldier by the name of P.C. Franzini had recently stayed at the Scharbauer Hotel in Midland, Texas. However upon further inspection it was found that Franzini was still alive and residing in Dallas. He had stayed at the hotel a much longer time ago then initially believed, and had since become a traveling salesman. 

On August 3rd, officers of the Mariposa Police Department discovered a blood spattered car out of gas abandoned along the highway 5 miles south of Mariposa. Despite being out of gas, the car was fully functional. Mariposa is 100 miles north of Traver and a 30 mile drive from Yosemite National Park.  They began an investigation into who the car was registered to. Papers in the car and in an Army Air Force summer uniform blouse found in the back seat were addressed to a Lieutenant Patrick C Fyffe. Word of the slaying in Traver had not yet made it to the Mariposa officers. However on August 5th the connection would be made. 

Lieutenant Patrick C Fyffe had been on his way home from Lake Charles, Louisiana where he had been visiting family. He was returning to his post at Mather Field, California (Sacramento). On his way home he passed through Texas. Fyffe had been a long time resident of Marshall, Texas. It was learned through receipts found in the glove compartment that Fyffe had had car trouble in Del Rio, Texas. His car had broken down 25 miles outside the city and required several hours worth of repairs. After speaking with mechanics it was learned that a male US marine had been in his company when he arrived at the auto shop. While having a conversation about the repairs needed with an employee, he mentioned his habit of picking up hitchhikers as he did not like to drive alone. It was confirmed that the Marine had left his company soon after learning the repairs would delay the trip a couple hours. Fyffe set off from Del Rio, Texas on July 27th at 10pm. 

Fyffe was documented having passed through the Arizona-California agricultural checkpoint/border alone in Fort Yuma, AZ. No sightings of Fyffe were reported between the California - Arizona border and Traver. A few newspapers speculate that he may have traveled through Nevada for a time while others suspected that the unknown hitchhiker had been picked up in Los Angeles.

On August 4th a green footlocker displaying Fyffes name was found between Giant Forest and Grant National Park. On the same day a report made it to officers that on July 30th a man had been seen driving Fyffe’s Car at the park entrance to Ash Mountain Sequoia National Park. The attendant had noticed that a running board had been ripped off the left side of the car. This was later confirmed to be a feature found on the car recovered in Mariposa. The next day it was discovered that the same man had been seen in Mariposa inquiring about directions and gas. Later that day a truck driver had witnessed the man leaving the car and carrying a duffle bag and suitcase at the same location the car was later found. They received a basic description of a 6ft tall man, in a military style uniform. On August 5th a miner claimed to have seen a man walking in Tremmer Springs. The miner described the man as 6ft and wearing a military uniform. The man said he was able to see an automatic pistol protruding from his hip. Officials continued to track the suspect up the canyon. Police received a tip from a Rancher that he had given a man a ride to Fresno earlier in the week. However upon arrival to the city the man asked if the driver could return him to Kings River Canyon. Investigators believed that the suspect was hiding out in the logging and mining villages along the pass. Locals in the Rocky Timber Regions had reported food being taken and goods stolen. However this would be where the trail goes cold. On August 9th a Jacket belonging to Fyffe was found at Lodge Pole which is 5 miles away from Dorst’s creek where the footlocker was found August 4th. No further evidence was discovered going forward. Sheriff Berry Rosborough from Marshall Texas contacted Sheriff Sherman explaining that he was a personal friend of the family and had known the flier all his life. He urged Sherman to “To do everything possible” to track down the killer. 

The only suspect authorities had in the case was a 19 year old Army deserter named Harold E Broome. Broome was arrested August 20th by Bakersfield police on the charge of forging checks. Shortly after being taken into custody Broome told officers an elaborate tale of beating to death a man named Dennis Nolan in the Lost Hills region of California. Broome was found to be in possession of Nolans checks and other documents. Lost Hills is 75 miles south of Traver. Dennis Nolan was a 45 year old Railway man from Grants Pass, Oregon. He had traveled to Rosemead, CA for business. Broome claimed the assault happened on August 14th. Nolan had picked up Broome in Southern California. Broome claimed he beat Nolan to Death with a tire iron and left him to die. However upon investigation of the scene, no body could be found. Broomes fictional tale was soon put to rest when Nolan arrived home in Grants Pass unhurt. However Nolan did confirm he drove Broome. Nolan suspected that Broome had stolen his checks and documents. Nolan is quoted as saying “I gave him a ride and let him out at lost hills. He offered me five dollars for the lift and was a perfect gentleman the entire way.” It is noted in articles that Police were able to verify that Broome was not a likely suspect. However frustratingly it is never explained why this is the case. He was later charged in the city of Stockton for cashing bank checks without sufficient funds. He was also charged by the Army for being a deserter from Fort Swift Texas. 

As I was doing research on this case I came upon another interesting story. On September 7th 1946 the Hayward Police Department received a letter from Army officials from San Antonio Texas. Private William J Randall had been arrested in Stockton, California on August 6th for the possession of a stolen car. Upon arrest in California, Randall was sent to Army authorities in San Antonio Texas. Once in the custody of Army authorities Randall admitted to the murder of a Walla Walla, Washinton undertaker in Oakland, California on August 3rd 1946. Randall described how at 7 pm on August 3rd a man picked him up in Oakland. He was riding in the back seat of the car while the man showed him how to operate the fluid drive when he pulled out a gun he had stolen earlier in the night and shot the man in the back of the head. He climbed over the seat and proceeded to drive to the Hayward Plunge. He hid the body in the fork of the limbs of a fallen tree covering it with rocks and dirt. He then drove home to his wife. However he could no longer sleep. He put on his Army uniform and returned the car to a similar area where he had hidden the body near the plunge. He abandoned the car into a gully. On August 4th he stole a car in the city of Hayward and headed to Stockton where he would be arrested on August 6th. Police searched the area and were unable to find any evidence of a body or car. Randall had been stationed at Hamilton Field, CA and was a local to the area. Upon finding nobody, authorities discounted his story. Randall was never a part of the Fyffe Homicide investigation and is likely unconnected to this story. However, a number of similarities exist when you compare the stories of Randall and Broome. Both claimed to have falsely assaulted a man from a state geographically north of California. Randall a man from Wala Wala, Wash and Broome a man from Grants Pass, Oregon. Both men describe killing a man and stealing his car. Randall with a gun in similar fashion to the Fyffe murder and Broome with a tire iron. Oakland is 200 miles Northwest of Traver. It is possible that Randall heard about the murder while in Army custody in Texas.  

Patrick C Fyffe was either 24 or 25 at the time of the murder depending on which Newpaper’s you site. His family was from Lake Charles, Louisiana. He had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, The Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the European, American, and Asiatic-Pacific theater ribbons, five battle stars on his Asiatic ribbon, the Victory Medal, and the Presidential Unit Citation. He had participated in 102 combat missions while overseas for 26 months. His service during the war took him to Canada, Alaska, South America, Haiti, the Middle East, and Asiatic Pacific. He had been assigned to Mather Field on January 23rd 1945. He had been ordered to attend the adjutant general's administrative school May 15th. He was single and maintained bachelors' quarters on base. 

The Army requested a new probe into the homicide in January 1947. However, the files are reported to have gone missing. Sheriff Ben B Gurr came into the position of Tulare County Sheriff in early 1947. He had been determined to re-open the investigation and made it a part of his campaign. Former Sheriff S. B Sherman had been a rival of Ben Gurr. Under Sherman, criminal investigator Ross C Cochran had closed the Fyffe case as an unsolved mystery. Some locals claimed a 3 month investigation had been too short. In 1947 Gurr and Cochran were competing for the position of Tulare County Sheriff. Former Sheriff Sherman put his support behind Cochran. However, Gurr won. The files are speculated to have gone missing in late December 1946 or Early 1947 during the transition of authority. Due to the missing files Gurr was unable to proceed with an investigation. Minor physical altercations between Gurr and Sherman were reported during this time, as well as missing payroll forms. Cochran would proceed to join the Tulare Police Force. No articles on the case exist after the mentioning of the missing files in 1947 except a single article in 1966 that references that police still look over the case files regarding the murder. No information on this case can be found online except on newspaper databases. \\

A FOIA request was submitted regarding the case to both the Tulare County Sheriff's Office and the FBI. The FBI stated that there were no responsive records. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office stated that they had no file on the homicide of Lieutenant Fyffe. The service manager of their records division informed me that all documents regarding this case were lost in the past when the facility they used to house old documents flooded. However, no further details were provided. The investigation into this case is not active. 

My sources for this post were news articles from the time. These include the Tulare Advanced Register, Visalia Times Delta, The Fresno Bee, and the Hanford Morning Journal. Dates, Spellings, and Accounts of the event sometimes differed between news sources. I tried to leave in detail that were reported multiple times by various papers or who authors provided a direct source for the information. However, a number of inconsistencies in regard to reporting did arise. 

With advances in technology, it is important that these obscure cases are not forgotten. Patrick Fyffe was an Army Air Corps Lieutenant who served his country faithfully during World War Two. Despite the rare chance that any progress can be made in this case it is important to ensure these heroes are not forgotten. 

What are your thoughts on this case ?

&gt;  
&gt;""It's going to be a long process to identify the remains,"" Riverside County Sheriff's Department spokesperson Sgt. Donald Larsen told the Los Angeles Times at the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Larsen was right. Thirty-six years after the remains were found — and 45 years after she went missing — Linda LeBeau has finally been identified.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Police still believe Phillip LeBeau to be the prime suspect in Linda's disappearance and murder. He allegedly returned home very late the night she went missing, and was wet and wearing different clothes than he left the house in.    
&gt;  
&gt;Phillip LeBeau died in 2008, so while Linda's remains have finally been identified, her murder case still officially remains unsolved.

This one will likely remain unsolved because of Philip's death but at least there's some closure for the family.

15 minutes after being dropped off, Melina visited her friend's house who lived across the park to see if she wanted to join her, but her friend was sick. Melina stayed for a few more minutes at her friend's house and then went to her boyfriend's house to grab a scarf and gloves so she could participate in the activities at the festival. She tells her boyfriend that she wants to break up which seems to have been taken ok. She leaves his house at about 2 - 2:30pm to go back to the park.

In the evening after Melina doesn't show up at the meeting place, her mother starts to worry since she usually notified her mother when her plans were changing, but the mother hadn't heard anything. So, she asks another daughter (Melina's older sister) if she's seen Melina but she hasn't, so they go around Farnham and ask Melina's friends and other locals if they've seen anything.

**Investigation**

The festival was a big outdoor event featuring dog sledding, a fire pit, etc. When Melina couldn't be found, her mother contacted the organizers of the dog sledding and other attendees, but nobody confirmed seeing Melina that day. So, the next day, after finishing their own search, they contact the police and at midnight, the police show up at the house to investigate. During this time, the mother circulates photos of her daughter and notes that there's no abnormalities about Melina's bedroom either. Her belongings are all still at home.

3 days later, the family was putting up posters around town and the police there asked what they were doing; as it turns out, the police had no idea about the missing child.

Police hypothesized that Melina had run away and would return, but her mother thought otherwise. No ground search was conducted because of this hypothesis by police. Apparently there was no other clue to give them a lead to give any other hypothesis. Her mother didn't accept this so she organized her own poster campaign, handing posters out to people and posting in other cities, and asked local hunters/others to search the grounds for any clues. Melina's case was barely broadcast or publicized, except for her mother's efforts. The family gives a few interviews but there is not much media attention.

In January 2006, one year after her disappearance, a policeman was stationed at the park where she disappeared to see if more information could be obtained from any witnesses. After 1 year of no leads, the police stated that they were open to other hypotheses, such as homicide.

5 years later, a local bank had a campaign to put a missing child on the back of the envelopes to spread awareness - Melina was chosen and her photo was put on the back of these envelopes. 4 milion of these envelopes were produced and mailed across Canada.

In 2018, some divers searched the Yamaska River for signs of Melina, but nothing was found.

Her father has since passed away but the family is still searching for answers. Her mother won't mourn or believe her daughter has passed away unless she has definitive proof (remains).

17,SwissChocolate1024,[],1642909106,"**The trip to Tokushima**

Shinya Matsuoka, 4 years old, lived with his parents, an older sister and a younger brother in Ibaraki prefecture. When his maternal grandmother suddenly passed away on the 5th of March 1989, the entire family went to Tokushima to attend her funeral which took place the following day. Afterwards, the family drove one hour away to a relative of the mother and stayed there for the night.  


**The disappearance**

On the morning of the 7th of March, at around 8 AM, the father, Shinya and the youngest sibling, 2 years old at the time, went for a walk. When Shinya didn't want to head home after about 10 minutes as his father suggested, they decided to drop off Shinya's brother and walk another round in the neighbourhood, which was in a very remote area with few homes.

Leading up to the house they were staying at, there is a flight of stairs, about 10 meters long. Shinya's father, carrying the toddler in his arms, walks ahead of Shinya, who slowly but surely made his way up. The father saw that Shinya had made it to the very top of the stairs. He steps into the entrance and hands over his younger son to the mother. 

A matter that takes a few seconds at most.

The father realises that Shinya hadn't followed him into the house and steps outside to see where he is. Shinya is nowhere to be seen. The father searches around the property, but isn't able to find his son. Very soon, family and relatives start joining the search effort, after a while the local fire brigade also starts to look for the 4 years old. Because there was concern he had gotten lost in the mountains, people began searching there, as well.

The disappearance became matter of law enforcement just after noon. The initial team consisting of 15 officers and about 100 riot police officers, firefighters and citizens saw the addition of officers to a total of 200 by the next day.

For the following 3 months, the search continued, but there were no leads that could help find Shinya.

**After the disappearance**

Obviously, the most puzzling aspect of this case is the short time span within Shinya vanished.

To clarify what facts investigators were faced with:

* The area where the family was staying was very remote and the house was located at the end of the town's road. This means that few people would go there if they didn't live in that corner.
* People doing field work just 100 meters away from the scene didn't see any strange cars. And there were no signs of traffic accidents in the area.
* No one outside the neighbourhood knew that the family was staying at the relative's house.

Even though Shinya was incredibly mature for his age and had no issues saying his parents' phone number, home address and names, investigators believed the chances of him having become a victim of a crime was low for the reasons mentioned above.

**The strange phone call**

Immediately after the disappearance of their son, the family set up a recording device on the phone located in the relative's house.

On the 16th of March, the day before the family had planned to return home, the phone rang.

Shinya's father picks up.

""Is your wife there?"" a female voice asks, with a typical Tokushima accent.

The father hands the phone to his wife.

""I am Mariko Nakahara's mother. My child is in group 'Moon' of the Seikei kindergarten""

The name of the kindergarten was familiar to her - that's where Shinya's older sister went at the time.

The voice continues. ""We have put together some money to support you. Where should we send it to? Are you returning home soon?""

The mother told the person at the other end of the line they were going to return home the following day.

Some time later, the mother hadn't heard anything about the fund yet, but hesitated to ask about it out of politeness. No phonecalls from Mariko's mother, either. 

Days went by and the mother decides to enquire about the money that was supposedly collected for her family.   
Turns out, there was no student named Mariko Nakahara and no money was collected for this purpose, either.

Thinking about it, the mother realised that it was odd that the call came from someone with a Tokushima accent, when they lived in Ibaraki. It made no sense that a guardian of one of the kindergarten students knew the number to the family's relative's house, anyway.

But then, how would someone from Tokushima know the name of her daughter's kindergarten?

Sadly, no useful lead came from this bizarre incidence.

**Sightings since**

Shinya's disappearance gathered some attention by the public and his family had made over 50 TV appearances and even made their home telephone number public to get as much information someone may know as possible.

This is a list compiling all of the supposed sightings of Shinya. (This is a translation by me of the list featured on [this website](https://kowaiohanasi.net/matuoka-sinya-jiken)).

   

* May 1989 - A man carrying a boy with a similar appearance to Shinya was seen by the ocean in Tokushima. When the witness tried to take a closer look at the boy's face, the man turned away and got into a white car. The area is known to be a place where North Korean ships come by.
* April 1990 - A housewive from Tokushima directly called the family's home phone and said she was absolutely certain she had seen Shinya. His father met this person to get more details. He handed all of the information to the police and requested to have the sighting verified to be of Shinya. When he enquired about it after not hearing from the police, the head of the department said he had been busy because his father had passed. No leads.
* 1990 - Hearing that a boy looking similar to Shinya was seen in front of a mall in Yamagata, his      father went there and handed out flyers of his missing child to locals, who confirmed they had seen the boy at a store on a playground. No further leads.
* 1991 - The mother was informed that a couple were seen with a child who, judging by their age difference, wasn't theirs, at a temple in Shikoku. She went there and looked for them, but couldn't find them.
* 1995 - An elderly man living in Hokkaidou claims he knew someone who told him they had gotten a child named Shinya as a gift from the main island. No leads.
* 1997 - A woman on her way home from work allegedly saw Shinya in a subway in Yokohama. He was sitting next to her and she said she got goosebumps, because he looked so similar to the missing child. He appeared to have injuries to his wrists, barely covered by bandage and overall looked not being cared of well. She talked to him and he told her he was being mistreated by an older man. She gave him her number in case he needs help and just once, he called her. No      further leads.
* 1998 - A cashier at a video rental store in the Chugoku region claims he saw a child with injured      wrists who took a Titanic post card, showed it to a man who looked like a yakuza member and who appeared to be keeping him under watch, and bought the card. The employee immediately told the store owner and the two went looking for the boy, but they were already gone.

**The man who claimed to be Shinya**

In 2018, a man named Ryuto Wada was shown on TV, where he claimed to be the missing Shinya Matsuoka. I personally remember this well, as the japanese corner of the internet was excited. Could this be the end of the mystery and the agonising search for Shinya? Could there be finally closure? Ryuto did look quite similar to Shinya, some said, and people were highly anticipating the results of the DNA test, which would conclusively tell the entire nation whether this was, in fact, the child who went missing nearly 3 decades ago.

[This website](https://www.wareko.jp/blog/shinya-matsuoka-missing-place-and-map#toc1) (japanese) lists all the information that were available about Ryuto Wada at the time.

Unfortunately, the DNA test concluded Ryuto was not Shinya Matsuoka.

The boy who went missing within 20 seconds has been missing for 33 years.","Tokushima prefecture, 1989: A father hands his toddler to his wife in the entrance of the house.

My previous write-up regarding the [disappearance of Loy Evitts](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/s7uxdx/kansas_city_cold_case_the_vanishing_of_loy_evitts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) got a lot more attention than I was expecting, and I can’t thank you all enough for all the comments and engagement on that post. Here’s hoping Loy gets justice soon. This time, I’d like to share a story about another disappearance with you all; this time, it involves two people—a mother and son. There has been no write-up that I can find about this particular case on Reddit, so I figured theirs would be a good case to cover. Here’s the story of Sandra and John Jacobson: 

**TW/CW: Mental illness &amp; suicide**

**Background** Sandra “Sandy” Mary Jacobson was born December 8, 1959, to Henry and Bernice Grensteiner. In November of 1996, the 36-year-old Sandra lived in the rural, sparsely-populated town of Center, North Dakota, in Oliver County and was employed with the North Dakota Department of Transportation. Sandra was married twice previously and had been separated from her second husband for three months at the time of her disappearance. She had two sons—Spencer, 16, and John, 5–both of whom lived with her at the time. 

**Disappearance** On the evening of November 16, 1996, Sandra and her son John had plans to have dinner at Sandra’s parents’ home in Bismarck, North Dakota. On the way there, Sandra made a troubling call to the Bismarck Police Department, during which she reported to the dispatcher that she believed there was satanic ritual abuse taking place at a farm near Center. The dispatcher later reported that Sandra sounded upset on the call. When asked why she chose to call the Bismarck Police Department rather than the police in Center, Sandra stated that she did not trust the Center police. 

When Sandra and John arrived at Sandra’s parents’ house around 7:30 PM, Sandra’s mother Bernice noticed that Sandra was exhibiting signs of mental illness, of which she had a history. Bernice suggested that Sandra seek help at a local hospital, and Sandra agreed, but she told her mother that she wanted to fill up her car with gas first; she promised to return after running the errand. Sandra and her son John left her parents’ home around 8:00 PM. Two hours later, at around 10:00 PM, Sandra and John had still not returned. It was at this time that Bernice decided to call the police and report her daughter and grandson missing.

The following day, police discovered Sandra’s abandoned gray 1990 Honda Civic at the Centennial Beach parking lot in Bismarck along the banks of the Missouri River. Police determined that Sandra and John had indeed made it to the gas station to fill up the car, as there was a receipt from a local convenience store found inside the vehicle. Also located were Sandra’s purse in the front seat, her keys in the ignition, and a shoe located outside the vehicle that may have belonged to John. Despite a lack of evidence, police theorized it was possible that Sandra and John ended up in the river, with the mother possibly murdering her son and then committing suicide by jumping into the icy waters. As part of their investigation, the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Department sent a dive rescue and recovery team into the frigid waters of the Missouri River to search for Sandra and John, but the strong current, poor weather conditions, and amount of ice in the river at that time of year hindered their efforts. 

**Aftermath** 
Sandra’s older son, Spencer, to whom she was said to be particularly close, was raised by his grandparents after his mother’s disappearance. In 2004, an unconfirmed sighting of Sandra and John in Warroad, Minnesota, was reported to police, which led to a revival of search efforts, but the case has since gone cold. The sighting could never be verified. In 2005, Spencer’s father was a victim of homicide in Tuttle, North Dakota; he was run over by his own car by an unknown assailant. His murder remains unsolved. Sandra’s mother, Bernice, passed away in 2011, aged 75. In her obituary, she is stated as having been preceded in death by her only daughter and her grandson. 

There is no evidence of foul play in Sandra and John’s disappearances, and no suspect has ever been named. Both Sandra and John have since been declared legally deceased.

**Physical Descriptions** Sandra Mary Jacobson was 5’5” and 145 lbs with brown hair and green/hazel eyes. John Jacobson was 3’ tall and 47 lbs with brown hair and brown eyes. Sandra was last seen wearing a blue sweatshirt, blue jeans, a blue down-filled jacket, and brown lace-up boots. She also wore glasses. John was last seen wearing a green winter coat with blue cuffs. 

**Additional Note** Sandra is the only missing person so far for whom I have submitted a potential match to the Doe Network, but I received a reply stating that she had been ruled out for that particular doe through NamUs. I have linked both of their Doe Network profiles in my sources if you would like to compare the two; the similarities are striking in my opinion.

19,ReddRabbbit,[],1642896088,"*\[Fair warning: this is really long and still barely scratches the surface of a very complicated issue. I am also not an actual Biblical scholar, just someone very interested in this issue, so please forgive me if I misuse terms or what have you.\]*

In the 1960s, Biblical scholar Morton Smith shocked basically everyone in his field by unveiling a newly discovered letter written by Clement of Alexandria, an early leader of the Church.

This letter discusses and quotes from a previously unknown early Christian text entitled *The Secret Gospel of Mark*. There are only two quotes. The second one is very short, but the first one is wild.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, ""Son of David, have mercy on me."" But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're a Biblical scholar, there's a *lot* to unpack there. If you're not a Biblical scholar, you might still be struck by the fact that Jesus apparently spends the night alone in a cave with a young man wearing only a linen cloth over his naked body? To me, and at least at one point to Morton Smith, it kind of sounds like this may suggest a sexual element to this initiation rite?

And what's really key is that this isn't just *any* previously unknown text. Again, the letter claims that these quotes are from the ""Secret Gospel of Mark,"" a second version of the existing Gospel with extra material, reserved for spiritually advanced readers who were already ""initiated into the great mysteries."" Supposedly, the Gospel we have today is only a shortened, introductory version meant for general audiences.

If that's true, it would be an absolutely incredible discovery. One that would permanently change the way we study and understand the Bible and early Christianity.

The only problem is that no one's sure if the letter is real – we don't have a copy of it, only Morton Smith's notes and photos, which is kind of suspicious.

Even if Smith is telling the truth about finding it, there's only one copy of this letter, and it's a copy made by a monk in the back of an unrelated book, so the ""original"" may never have existed.

And even if the original *did* exist, that doesn't necessarily mean Clement actually wrote it. There were lots of falsely attributed letters floating around in the early Christian world – some of them even made it into the New Testament.

And even if Clement *did* write it, that doesn't mean he had accurate information about what the Gospel was or where it came from.

There are tons of possibilities here, but I think there are two main questions. First, was Morton Smith telling the truth? And second, was there really a Secret Gospel of Mark?

# Part One: Background

To really get why this is such a big deal, there's some general background information you should probably know about the New Testament as it currently exists and the apocrypha we already know about.

**What's Apocrypha?**

The New Testament is a compilation of pre-existing texts. The various books in the New Testament were written at various times over the course of several centuries before eventually being compiled and canonized as agreed-upon Christian scripture. 

But the books in the New Testament weren't the only books about Jesus written in the first few centuries AD. In fact, there are quite a few that didn't make the cut. Part of the point of compiling the New Testament was to establish which books contained accurate information and theology and which were heretical or misinformed.

Books that didn't make the cut are now called ""apocrypha."" This literally means ""secret"" or ""hidden"" or something to that effect. It's a term that some of these works applied to themselves, kind of like titling it ""The Gospel They Don't Want You To Read!"" or whatever.

Eventually some early Christian leaders made blanket statements about books that refer to themselves as apocrypha being disreputable and not worth reading. Today we use the term ""apocrypha"" to mean any text written around the same time as and about the same people and events as the New Testament books which is not actually in the New Testament.

**What's in the New Testament?**

The New Testament contains a bunch of letters, some of which were written by Paul – though not all the letters attributed to him are likely to have been written by him. Paul's letters are the oldest documents in the New Testament.

It also contains four Gospels. ""Gospel"" literally means ""good news."" All four Gospels tell the story of Jesus's life and earthly ministry, as well as his death and crucifixion. 

Three of those Gospels are called the ""synoptic"" Gospels – literally, ""seen together."" This is because they contain roughly the same events in roughly the same order, sometimes with exactly the same wording. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are the synoptic Gospels.

Of these, basically everyone agrees that Mark was written first, probably around the year 70. Luke and Matthew were written later, probably around the year 85. The authors of Luke and Matthew seem to have both used Mark as a source when writing their texts (Side note: despite their names, the Gospels are generally agreed to not actually have been written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, hence the weird phrasing of ""the author of Luke,"" etc.). 

Mark is a really early and foundational Christian text. There are very few works that predate it, and because it's a source for Luke, Matthew, and several apocryphal texts, it's likely that even Christians who hadn't read it got a lot of its information and ideas secondhand. This is part of what makes Smith's supposed discovery such a big deal. It's not just anyone saying this -- it's the author of Mark!

# Part Two: The Discovery

In the 1940s, Morton Smith was a student at Harvard Divinity School. He took a trip to Jerusalem as part of his classwork and wound up stuck in the city longer than he anticipated due to the beginnings of World War II. He spent some of this time in the library of Mar Saba, a Greek Orthodox monastery a little less than twenty miles from the city. Mar Saba was founded in the fifth century AD. After more than a thousand years it had assembled a very impressive library which was, according to Smith, very disorganized and essentially uncatalogued. 

Several decades later, Smith returned to that same library, this time as a Columbia professor on sabbatical. The monastery wasn't open to the public, but he received special permission to spend three weeks cataloging and studying its texts.

At some point during those three weeks, he found a printed copy of the letters of Ignatius of Antioch dating to around 1650. But this text ended with something bizarre: a handwritten copy of a letter in Greek, supposedly from Clement of Alexandria to someone named Theodore.

In this letter, Clement talks about how a group of very non-orthodox Christians called the Carpocratians have a copy of the Secret Gospel of Mark, but they've forged some additions to it and misinterpreted the text. To clarify that, he quotes a few parts of the *real* secret Gospel, then goes on to explain what those quotes mean. Unfortunately, the letter is cut off before we get the explanations, so we have no idea how Clement -- if this really is Clement -- interpreted these excerpts. 

It's a big deal for Smith to even be allowed into this library, much less for him to have three weeks to catalog everything. He definitely can't just take one of their books. Instead, he takes several black and white photographs of it and leaves it in the library.

Smith studied those photographs for a few years in an attempt to verify their authenticity. He compared the vocabulary in the letter to existing letters of Clement. If the letter introduced too many new words, it might indicate that someone else was writing in Clement's name. Smith also consulted with several handwriting experts, who dated this copy of the letter back to somewhere around the 18th century.

Apparently satisfied that the letter could be real, Smith made his findings public in 1960, two years after the initial discovery. Thirteen years later, in 1973, he published two books on the subject -- one for a popular audience and one for a scholarly audience. 

# Part Three: Why Doubt Morton Smith?

At the time, Smith was a notable figure in the field with a solid reputation. He visited the Mar Saba library while on sabbatical from his job as a professor at Columbia University. Generally speaking, he seems like a pretty trustworthy source on the subject. And initially, most scholars seemed to generally accept his findings -- though they may have disagreed with his interpretation, and it's important to note that believing the letter is real is not the same as believing the letter is accurate.

But over time, more and more doubts pile up. Here are a few of them:

**We Don't Have the Letter**

Because Morton Smith found the document in the private library of a monastery and left it there, we don't have access to the physical document -- only to Smith's photos. That prevents scholars from studying the letter as closely as they'd like to. In particular, many people would like to test the ink of the letter in order to get a more accurate date. Testing the paper fibers is less pressing because it's written on the endpages of an existing book, but would probably still be worth doing if possible.

Only a few other scholars ever got to actually see the letter in person -- one group saw it in the 1970s, but for reasons which I find deeply unclear didn't actually mention this to anyone until 2003. Apparently, during the visit they had the opportunity to get the ink tested, but the only ink testing lab available belonged to the Jerusalem police, and there was some concern about turning the book over to the police, so they just didn't test it.

Father Kallistos Dourvas, the librarian at the monastery, released color photographs of the text in the year 2000. Why did he decide to take photographs then, after forty years of debate? He didn't! They were actually taken twenty years earlier, in 1983, when Quentin Quesnell saw and studied the original text -- a fact which he *also* did not disclose until 2007 for some reason. 

No one is exactly sure where the original is now, and unless someone else makes a decades-late announcement, no scholar has seen the original in almost forty years.

**Word &amp; Style Analysis**

If Smith or someone else forged the letter in or before 1958, they would have had limited resources to mimic Clement's style. Specifically, they'd be working with the actual letters of Clement and maybe a copy of Otto Stählin's concordance of Clement, which was published in 1936.

Today, most Clement scholars seem to agree that the letter is very, very similar to Clement's actual writing, and that it would have required almost impossible skill to fake, particularly with the technology and information available in 1958.

Some disagree, and have used word analysis in an effort to prove it. It does look like the letter contains a statistically improbable number of some of the least-used words from Clement's other work. Other people doubt that this is actually a useful metric for determining authorship.

**The Convenience**

Some scholars think the finding is just too lucky. They see the letter as a perfect fit for Morton Smith's existing research areas, and the fact that he just happened to find an ancient text that lines up perfectly with his previous research, and it happened to be in a library monastery which he had visited before and which was generally closed to the public, seemed like too many coincidences to believe.

It's also worth noting that this is, far and away, the biggest thing Smith is known for. I can name maybe ten Biblical scholars offhand, and eight of them are Morton Smith or people who commented on or argued with Morton Smith in some way. This event drastically changed his career, and some think that would be another motive for forging the letter.

**The Novel**

In 1940, James H. Hunter published a novel titled *The Mystery of Mar Saba*. Plot summary per Wikipedia:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The story revolves around finding a long-lost document in the [Mar Saba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Saba)  Monastery that is potentially embarrassing to Christianity. The  document is later exposed as the work of a hoaxer. The hero is a British  policeman in the Palestine mandate and his born-again American  assistant.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Hunter#cite_note-4)  The villain of the story is a close-shaven German archaeologist who  leads a band of Arab ""Hooded Ones,"" including the cowardly ""Abid of the  Scar,"" who stabs a girl in the back. 

  
Some scholars think this novel may have inspired Smith to forge a similar document. Personally I think that if a novel inspired me to forge ancient texts I would probably not put them in the exact same monastery as the original book, but it is a pretty wild coincidence.

**The Clues**

Some people think there are specific clues in the text of the letter that point back to Morton Smith, intentionally, as a kind of joke. Clement mentions ""salt losing its savor"" in the letter. For some people, this is enough to point at Smith -- they think this is an odd phrase for Clement to use, and connect ""salt"" to the Morton Salt company. As far as I can tell, the first person to propose this theory goes a little further -- he thought the specific way the phrase was constructed suggested flowing, pourable salt, which effectively did not exist until the 20th century, when it was invented by the Morton Salt company.

The same guy claimed there was a complicated second joke, but it has to do with other books in the library and relies on several typos and misunderstandings that debunk it pretty much completely.

The Morton Salt connection seems to be generally ignored, but I've seen it brought up as evidence within the last few years, so.

**Handwriting Analysis**

Over the last 60 years, various efforts to analyze the handwriting of the letter have come to various conclusions. Originally, the text was viewable almost exclusively as a black and white halftone print, which complicated these efforts. Halftone has a tendency to add a slight wobble to small details, which can make handwriting analysis difficult. Some early analysis saw the text as being written with a trembling hand, but that tremble was no longer evident when the original photos were used instead of halftone reproductions.

Some analysts see the writing as distinctly different from Smith's own, and very different from his Greek writing, which wasn't particularly good. Others see the text as an effort to copy the style of eighteenth century Greek, and claim that the text has signs of discontinuous strokes -- that is, that someone drew part of a line, lifted the pen, then drew the rest in an attempt to make them appear contiguous. That's common among people who try to mimic the style of another text.

# Part Four: What Would It Mean?

Okay, if we assume that Morton Smith is telling the truth, that the letter is real, and that it really was written by Clement, what does that mean for Christianity? Well, there's still one big question to ask: Is the Secret Gospel really Pre-Markan, as Clement says, or does it just claim to be, and Clement has it wrong?

In other words, did the author of Mark actually write two versions of his Gospel, meaning that the Secret Gospel predates the Gospel we have today, or did someone else add to the regular Gospel of Mark after the fact, and just make up the ""Secret Gospel"" as an origin story for their additions?

Most scholars who believe the Secret Gospel existed believe the latter option is the case, but it's far from settled. If the Secret Gospel is a falsely attributed work assembled after-the-fact, then it has no major impact on Christian history. There were tons of apocryphal texts floating around that attribute much wilder statements than this to leaders of the early church, or to Jesus Himself. 

But if it is true that this book predates Mark, that changes a whole, whole lot. Again, Mark was the first Gospel written and it's used as a source for the other two synoptic Gospels. Knowing that it's actually pared down from a longer version, and that the longer version was only available to a select few, would really change our understanding of the early church -- and that's just knowing that it existed. There's no telling what it might actually contain besides these two quotes.

Also, think about what happens in the longer excerpt I already quoted. If it really was part of Mark that was removed for general audiences, that would mean that the author of Mark for some reason saw that exchange as being too challenging for new Christians to understand, which, at least for me, raises a bunch of new questions!

# Part Five: Conclusions

To recap the possibilities:

* Morton Smith forged the letter.
* Morton Smith found a letter which someone else forged.
* Morton Smith found a copy of a letter forged in antiquity and falsely attributed to Clement.
* Morton Smith found a copy of a real letter of Clement, which refers to a Gospel Clement mistakenly believed to predate the Gospel of Mark.
* Morton Smith found a copy of a real letter of Clement, which refers to a real Gospel which predated Mark and which was reserved for advanced Christians.

At this point, there doesn't really seem to be a scholarly consensus on which of these is most likely, but I think the plurality of scholars either believe that Morton Smith forged the whole thing or that it's real, but Clement was confused about the origin of the Secret Gospel and that it does not actually predate Mark. The analysis of the letter by Clement scholars lends it a lot of authenticity, and Morton Smith's own less-than-stellar skill at Greek and form criticism lead many to believe he just didn't have the skill to forge a copy that held up to any serious scrutiny.

At this point we are pretty much out of evidence and do not know the whereabouts of the original letter, so the best hope of finding out more would be to find another copy of this letter -- possibly a more complete copy -- or a copy of the Secret Gospel of Mark itself. Neither seems super likely.","""In the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God."" -- Was there really a Secret Gospel of Mark?"

I have been looking for a case for sometime now and it is driving me insane.

I remember it taking place in the 1950s or 1960s. It had a Wikipedia page. A young girl was found murdered in the attic bedroom She shared with her sister. I remember the murder took place around the wintertime. She was supposed to go shopping with a girlfriend and I think the girlfriend found her when she didn't respond to phone calls so they drove to her house to check up on her. The friend found the front door open.

I also remember that She had been reciving gifts from an unknown person, specifically a necklace. Crime scene photos were also available online, maybe something was even written on the wall?

Also if I am not mistaken, that day she visited her grandmother for lunch and was driven home by a young man (friend?).

Any help would be appreciated, I googled every variation I could think of :(.

2. How would he get a live bullet into the gun?

Without answering those questions, I can't see how any court will find him guilty of killing Helena Catchins. This will be ruled as an accident most likely. Balwin is not responsible for the gun, and he had no motive to kill Helena.

**February 3, 2004**

Beautiful Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan blessed her parents Jennifer Buchanan and Shane Hinojosa in Monroe, Michigan and changed their lives forever. She was described as a little ""tomboy"" who hated dresses and was very fond of the look and sound motorcycles; She even has a motorcycle on her headstone. One of her favorite movies to watch was ""The Jungle Book"", and it was always on repeat.[(source)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37924376/nevaeh-amyah-buchanan) Nevaeh was described as ""having a smile that would warm the room, a personality that could tame the wildest heart, and a love for life that was only second to her love of family"". She loved preschool and was a great student. Nevaeh had also made a new best friend named Austin; He lived in the same apartment complex as her.

Naveah would have been 18 this year. Officially considered an adult. However, this poor child wouldn't even make it to kindergarten before her life was tragically and horrifically cut short. This is the unsolved murder of Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan. [(source)](https://merklefh.com/tribute/details/95/Neveah-Buchanan/obituary.html)

**May 24, 2009. Memorial Day Weekend. Monroe, Michigan.**

It was a warm spring day in Monroe, Michigan and 5-year-old Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan was playing with other children, going into and out of the apartments in Charlotte Arms where she lived with her mother, Jennifer, and her grandmother and legal guardian, Sherry. Around 6:30pm, Nevaeh told her mother that she was going to play with a friend upstairs in the same unit where they lived. Nevaeh was last seen wearing a light blue shirt with red and white horizontal stripes and a white V-neck collar and jean shorts; She was not wearing shoes or socks. When it was time for dinner, a child told Jennifer that Nevaeh had actually been playing outside on her scooter. ""She wasn't supposed to be outside,"" Jennifer Buchanan said. ""She was supposed to be upstairs at a neighbor's playing with her friend at their place."" [(source)](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/05/grace.coldcase.nevaeh.buchanan/index.html) . She began searching for her around 7pm. The only trace of Nevaeh was her tricycle, sitting abandoned on the edge of the driveway. 

After an hour of searching, 911 was called and a large-scale search for Nevaeh was ensued, including the K-9 unit and helicopters, as well as officers and volunteers, citizens of Monroe. A nearby quarry was searched by divers and sonar equipment. [(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7697163&amp;page=1) All 180 apartments were searched and residents were questioned. The only possible witness was Tim Finley, who had visited his sister who lived at the complex. He left the apartments around 7pm and he said he hadn't noticed any children playing outside, but did see a ""little red car"" speed out of the complex parking lot. [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb) Other then his sighting, no one saw or heard anything. 

Around 12:30am May 25, an Amber Alert was issued for her.

**June 4, 2009. River Raisin. 10 Days after Nevaeh Disappeared.**

Around 9:30am, two fishermen spent their morning fishing at the River Raisin riverbank near Dixon Road, about 10 miles from Charlotte Arms Apartments. While fishing on the rocks, the fishermen noticed a concrete block. At one point, one of the men stumbled on the concrete and a piece of it gave way, revealing a heartbreaking sight: human remains. Flies immediately swarmed to the exposed skin, and the two fishermen called the police. The clothes matched what Nevaeh was last seen wearing. It didn't take long for body to be identified, but they had to wait for DNA to confirm. 

It's important to note that the concrete/cement was not mixed properly. Nevaeh's body floated to the surface of the cement, revealing an imprint of her little body. The cement had also chipped away and crumbled easily. If the cement would have been mixed correctly, her body might have never been found.

The autopsy revealed that Nevaeh had died of asphyxiation after finding dirt in her nose, lungs, and windpipe [(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8089505). Manner of death, homicide. [(source)](https://interactive.wtol.com/pdf/BuchananReport.pdf) To make the matter worse, there is a possibility little Nevaeh had been buried face-down in the makeshift cement grave, alive. However, in the autopsy report, it could not be determined whether she was in fact buried alive, or had her face forcibly held down in dirt. Either way, Nevaeh had died by inhaling dirt. Police say there were no signs of abuse and that she had been buried there ""for a while"". Her body was heavily decomposed. There was no mention of sexual abuse in the autopsy report. [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb)

Noteworthy, brown carpet fibers were found on her body (possibly underneath her fingernails, but I've only seen one source with this information.

Will give credit in next parenthesis) (*Detroit News, The: Web Edition Articles (MI) - July 16, 2009 Nevaeh investigators probe carpet fibers,  Samples removed from apartment where slain girl lived.*)

**June 13, 2009. Her Funeral.**

Around 700 people attended Nevaeh's funeral, expressing their remorse and sorrow for ""Monroe's Little Angel"". “That one little girl was so powerful, she brought the community together,” said the Rev. Dale Hayford. Nevaeh's love for motorcycles was honored immensely. Nine officers on motorcycles led her to her final resting place. Her hearse was pulled by a Harley-Davidson, her favorite kind of motorcycle.  Another 60 motorcycles and 100 cars followed behind. At St. Joseph Cemetary, around 500 mourners looked on her grave site as the funeral director released a white dove into the sky. [(source)](https://www.theoaklandpress.com/2009/06/14/monroe-mourns-as-nevaeh-buchanan-laid-to-rest/)

A memorial erected where Nevaeh's body was found. Leaving stuffed animals, a wooden cross with her name, balloons. Fishermen don't normally go there after what happened. The two fishermen that found her body often tend to the spot where she was found, so people never forget. 

Did you notice that Nevaeh's name is ""Heaven"" spelled backwards? (Not to bring my emotions or religion into the post, but I like to think that is where she is. I like to think that Nevaeh is in Heaven.)

**The Investigation**

Before Nevaeh's body would be found, police had already arrested two persons of interest: convicted sex offenders George Kennedy and Roy Lee Smith. Rumors swirled that Jennifer and Kennedy were romantically involved, but she shot these rumors down. However, she did state that Nevaeh did look at Kennedy like a father figure, calling him ""Daddy George"" [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb). Jennifer was introduced to Smith through Kennedy. Even though she was aware of their sex offender statuses, she overlooked them but ""always kept her guard up about that"". With a search warrant, police searched the motel and van where Kennedy resided and found a blood soaked towel and tool, shorts, and photos of a young girl, but nothing to connect him to Nevaeh. (Noteworthy, there are reports that Kennedy did work with cement. There was also a cement company behind where Kennedy was residing). Both men were arrested for violating their probation by being around a child and were never officially named suspects in Nevaeh's disappearance. No evidence was found to suggest their involvement in Nevaeh's murder.  [(source)](https://www.foxnews.com/story/sex-offender-eyed-by-police-was-father-figure-to-missing-girl-says-mother)

Police have since shifted their focus away from the two sex offenders. ""We are looking in a different direction in recent months, based on our investigation,"" said Detective Sgt. Heath Velliquette. [(source)](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/05/grace.coldcase.nevaeh.buchanan/index.html)

There was a third man, James Easter, who was named a person of interest by police. After being interrogated by police, Easter built a fire in his backyard and burnt some of his property. He was arraigned on arson charges. [(source)](https://nbc24.com/news/local/updated-authorities-want-to-talk-to-driver-of-minivan-in-nevaeh-case)

Police also were looking for a green mini-van that was seen at the Hollywood School at the time of Nevaeh's disappearance. Authorities were seeking information from the driver regards to seeing anything that night. [(source)](https://www.wtol.com/amp/article/news/latest-in-search-for-nevaeh-green-van-search/512-e71768b5-7eb5-4228-8557-f02d3f92941e) Also, the article mentions two young boys that police questioned about the night of her disappearance. ""The Nevaeh Buchanan Task Force, composed of the FBI, Michigan State Police, Monroe County Sheriff's Department and Monroe Police Department, identified the two boys, who were seen playing at the Hollywood School playground near the girl's apartment complex last Sunday. Authorities want to question the boys, believed to be 7-10 years old, to determine if they witnessed anything related to the girl's disappearance.""[(source)](http://forums.delphiforums.com/coldcases/messages?msg=5967.5&amp;gid=2096558024)  Again, I didn't see any follow ups about this.

*(Now, of course I take news articles that don't even spell the victims name right with a grain-of-salt, but I thought that this was important to add. Also, this is the only article/report that I have seen with this information so, like I said, take it lightly. Take this information as you will.* [(source)](https://ohionewstime.com/what-happened-to-nevae-buchanan-an-unsolved-michigan-child-murder-case/280933/))

A woman (her identity was never revealed) had come forward and said that the day before Nevaeh's disappearance, she had seen Nevaeh ""looking at various cars in the parking lot. There was this black car she was trying to deflate from the tires.“ The woman had said she never saw the black car before, and it stayed in the lot until the next day: the day Nevaeh disappeared. According to the article, police received a complaint May 23, 3.2 miles away from Charlotte Arms in Greenwick Commons, about a man driving a black Grand Prix who had revealed his penis to two children asking them ""Have you seen one of these?"". The man was Paul Miller Jr.  Investigators interviewed Miller’s mother and father, ""who told police that his son would wake up in the morning and take a shower and would not return until late at night. They also said he was a friend of Roy Lee Smith, driving a black car, fishing in various places around Monroe."" [(source)](https://ohionewstime.com/what-happened-to-nevae-buchanan-an-unsolved-michigan-child-murder-case/280933/) Miller plead guilty to obscene acts. I have not seen any follow ups regarding Miller and his connection to Nevaeh. 

And the most current update: in 2014, Monroe's local paper revealed that police believe an unnamed man currently in prison for domestic abuse charges was a likely person of interest in Nevaeh's murder. [(source)](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/monroe-mystery-continues-in-unsolved-murder-of-5-year-old-nevaeh) They do not have enough evidence to convict him or press charges. 

**Aftermath**

It has been 13 years since Nevaeh's kidnapping and murder, and there have been no arrests, no suspects, nothing. Nevaeh's distant cousin Risa Smith has been searching for answers to Nevaeh's case since Day 1. She runs ""Justice for Nevaeh"" on Facebook and has given multiple interviews/quotes. Risa also keeps binders of notes and information regarding her case. ""Smith says the place where Nevaeh's body was not easy to get to, and finds it hard to believe that no one saw anything regarding her disappearance.""

Everybody around that apartment said they heard no screaming or nothing""[(source)](https://www.wxyz.com/news/a-decade-later-still-no-answers-in-the-murder-of-5-year-old-nevaeh-buchanan) Who could have possibly abducted Nevaeh in broad daylight without anybody noticing? ""Everyone that we talked to said she was very shy and she would not go up to someone she did not know,"" Risa Smith says. ""No one we talked to said they heard a kid crying or screaming or asking for help. Did she know this person and that's why she willingly went? DID she willingly go? Nobody knows that.""

To this day, there have been no arrests. No suspects. No updates. Nevaeh's murder remains unsolved and her case still lacks justice. Nevaeh deserves justice. Anyone with information is encouraged to call the detective's bureau at 734-240-7530 or CrimeStoppers at 1-800-773-2587. Anything helps.

**Thoughts**

There is a lot of inconsistent information regarding Nevaeh's murder. Some articles include James Easter as a person of interest, others just name George Kennedy and Roy Lee Smith as persons of interest. Some articles say she was found June 5, others June 4. The lack of consistent information leads to speculation and incorrectness that can jeopardize the investigation and lead to speculation. I tried to keep the information as consistent as possible and cited my sources. I can only hope that I did Nevaeh justice. I wanted to keep this respectful.

Now, I didn't include evidence found in the write up because I've seen many different things. Some articles state there was a Busch beer can, a cigarette butt, and a 90 lb bag of ready mix cement found at the scene. I only saw two sources that stated they found carpet fibers on her body.

Michael Martin was a 25-year-old man living in Kearsley, Greater Manchester, England. Michael was described as a loving son that always put his family first. His father described him as very family oriented, always looking out for his mum and siblings. Despite his good nature, Michael suffered from depression and anxiety, which lead him down a path that often got him involved in criminal activity.

**The last time Michael was seen alive**. On Sunday, August 7, 2016, Michael was in a car with a friend of his when they had some form of altercation. This resulted in the car stopping in the middle of the street. Both men got out of the car and began to search it for a short time while arguing. During the altercation, the car-key snapped in the ignition, however the two of them managed to jump-start the car, after which his friend drives the car to a nearby service station.

Michael’s friend went into the shop to see if he could obtain tools to repair the car. During this time, Michael arrives at the service station on foot, wearing 1 shoe. Michael opens 3 of the car’s doors and sits in the front passenger seat. He proceeds to close the driver’s side door and gets out of the vehicle, entering the shop to ask his friend if they can leave. As Michael’s friend returns to the car, Michael leaves the shop and begins walking back to the car.   
 Upon reaching the back of the car, Michael appears to touch the boot before turning 180 degrees. Michael is captured running in the opposite direction, looking behind him as he runs. Follow-up CCTV footage shows Michael run down a nearby street, Back Bolton Road. This is the last time Michael has ever been seen.

**Investigation.**

Police have searched several properties and some rural areas in Kearsley after his car was discovered on Vermere Avenue, but with nearly no evidence arising, Police have made little progress in the case.

There is no evidence to suggest Michael been on social media, used his phone or touched his bank accounts, and without having found a body, Police are treating the investigation as murder, suspecting that he was killed and hidden or disposed of.  (Greater Manchester Police (GMP) detective superintendent Lewis Hughes said: ""We believe that somebody has harmed Michael, killed him and we believe that his body has actually been disposed of"") 

In 2019, police began to search Clifton Country Park which in relation to Michael’s disappearance, however the search did not yield any results associated with the case. There is a £50,000 reward for information that leads to Michael’s killer being caught.

It's now been several years, police have searched and examined footage. There's a sizeable reward out for information and yet nobody has come forward. Michael's family is still left wondering what happened to him. No activity, no body and no evidence. Michael's parents have appealed multiple times across media, with their own suspicions ""I am appealing to anyone out there who knows information to come forward and do the right thing, particularly Michael's group of friends, who I believe have the answers"".

**Coverage**

As far as I (and many others on social media) can guess, Michael's affiliations with crime is probably associated with his disappearance, but it doesn't necessarily explain why he took off running. If anyone has a theory to what he might've seen, or what caused such irrational behaviour, let me know!

As to the last time I've seen media cover Michael's disappearance, The Bolton provided an update in September of 2020, however there was no substantial change in the case.

If anyone has information, they are encouraged to contact police or Crimestoppers anonymously.

TW: Suicide, physically abusive relationship.

**Before the murder**  
Sato Kozue and her friend, who coincidentally has the exact same name as her (I will refer to the murder victim as Kozue B and her friend as Kozue A from here on), were friends from high school. Around February 2007, they met Katsuyuki Obara (born 1979) when he approached them while they were hanging around at a gaming centre.

Kozue A and Obara start dating. Both Kozue A and B would drop out of high school and Kozue A starts a life with Obara that is devoid of stability. They sometimes lived in a car or at one of his friends' houses.

**The conflict with ""Z""**  
Obara tells Kozue A in May of 2007 that he is in trouble. Apparently, in October of the previous year, a man (we'll refer to as Z), who was in his 30s at the time, helped him get a job at a friend's construction company. However, Obara decides to flee from the workplace after working for just 10 days. This enraged Z, who started demanding compensation from Obara for tarnishing his reputation.

Obara, Kozue A and Obara's brother visit Z to beg him for forgiveness. Kozue A waited in the car while Obara and his brother went inside Z's house with Sake. However, things don't go as they hoped as Z was still enraged and even went as far as to threaten the two with a Katana sword, which he allegedly stuck in Obara's mouth. Z also used expressions and slangs commonly used by yakuza, specifically about cutting off one's finger as apology.  
Obara was forced to sign a contract where he promised to pay 1200000 Yen to Z. (Z would deny the allegation later when asked by a journalist and would claim that he didn't threaten them with a Katana sword and the amount he demanded was just 100000 Yen). He had to provide a joint guarantor and chose his girlfriend Kozue A.

Obviously Obara didn't have such money and since then, he was constantly trying to escape Z.  
Z started posting private information and pictures of Obara on online forums in order to find him.

On the 3rd of June 2008, Obara went to the police to report Z for threatening him. Oddly enough, Obara went back to the police later in an attempt to take back the police report. However, this was unuccessful, as there was a need for Kozue A to come to the police station with him, because she was the joint guarantor for the money Obara owed Z. But Kozue A refused to accompany him to the station.

The reason why Kozue A didn't want to go to the station with him was her decision to break up with Obara, because he was physically abusive towards her. In fact, she had already returned home to her parents.

The police was adamant that the repost should not scrapped and even asked Obara's father that since Z would be arrested within days, they should let the police keep pursiung him.

**The murder**

On the 28th of June 2008, Kozue B was hanging out with a friend, when Obara called her and asked her to meet him, because he wanted to confide in her about relationship issues he was having. The friend would later claim that Kozue B laughed and joked that she thinks she is going to be murdered.

After that day, Kozue B went missing and was found dead three days later on the 1st of July 2008 around 4:30 PM on a river bank by a road worker.

***Obara's disappearance and him becoming a fugitive***

On the day as Kozue B's body was found, Obara left a friend's house he was living at around 5 PM. After returning at about 7:30 PM, he was acting unusual. He hugged his friend and told him he had no option but to leave the town and cried.

At 9 PM, Obara caused a car crash. According to witnesses, he said that he is ""done for"" and ""has no option but to kill himself"".

On the following day, Obara asked a relative to drive him to the police station, since he had totalled his own car. But he then changed his mind and asked the relative to frop him off at the Unosu Cliff - a famous suicide spot.

After the relative had left, at 9:27 PM, he sent a mail to his brother and Kozue A, telling them about his intention of taking his own life. He then called a friend to thank him one last time, telling him he was about to jump. The friend immediately drove to the Unosu Cliff to convince Obara.  
When he arrived, Obara was sitting at the cliff and talking on the phone with someone the friend believed was a police officer. Relieved, the friend left the scene.

Kozue A also contacted police and asked them to check on Obara, but it was later revealed that the welfare check wasn't done at all.

On the 3rd of July, Obara's belongings including cigarettes and his wallet were found at the cliff, but because no body was found, the police determined the suicide was staged.

On the 29th, the police officially determined Obara as their suspect for Kozue B's murder, due to blood and items found in the car he had crashed the das before his (staged) suicide.

Obara is still missing to this day.

**Journalist Kuroki**

Former police Sergant and investigative journalist Akio Kuroki was suspicious as to why the police were so quick to paint Obara as their one and only suspect.

Kuroki then came up with a theory: Obara couldn't have committed the murder.  
Obara had hurt his right hand, injuring his ring finger and pinky. Obara's injury were so severe that he couldn't hold chop sticks and had to eat using a fork. The doctor who looked at Obara's hand claimed that the injuries on Obara's hand would have made it impossible for him to not only strangle the victim, but to discard of the body by throwing her over the bridge, down onto the river bank.

Furthermore, the items left at the cliff included Obara's sandles. It would be difficult for him to flee and disappear barefoot and there was no public transport in that area. Kuroki theorised that Obara could have been kidnapped by someone and killed.

Kuroki also claimed that Obara had no motive to kill Kazue B and even had an alibi.

The journalist concludes: It is clear that the conflict with Z has started this case. The police has even denied the fact that they had received a report from Obara. They are being lazy with the investigation. 

Kuroki spent the last two years of his life following this case. Even going to court with Obara's father to get the police to take down his son from the fugitive suspects-list. Collecting signatures by locals to get the police to set up a task force for this case. Kuroki was a journalist with integrity and dediation, who invested his personal time and money to find out what really happened. Still, the public wasn't really interested in this case.

On the 2nd of November 2010, Kuroki took his own life. In his suicide note, he wrote that the case in Iwate has changed his life and he does not regret that.

27,HoloGalaxy,[],1642749621,"Beth Kenyon was a Coral Gables High School special needs teacher and cheerleading squad coach, and a former fashion model who both won the Orange Bowl Princess title in 1982 and was a finalist in a Miss Florida contest.

On the afternoon of March 5, 1984, Beth was seen by a school security officer as she was leaving the school parking lot. However, that night she didn't return to the apartment she shared with a roommate and had not shown up for work the next day. She has not been seen since that day.

Beth's parents, alerted by her roommate, reported her missing. But dissatisfied with the Metro-Dade Police Department's handling of their missing person report, the Kenyons began an investigation of their own. They talked to friends, co-workers--anyone who might be able to give them any information that would be helpful in finding Beth.

They discovered through a friend of Beth's that she frequented a gas station near the school. Her father spoke to the attendant and learned that Beth had stopped for gas that day. He also saw her talking to a man in a Cadillac Eldorado, and she and the man talked of going to the airport to take photos.  That man, Christopher Wilder, paid for her gasoline and they drove off together. Later her parents discovered her abandoned car in the parking lot of Miami International Airport. 

Wilder had been linked to at least a dozen disappearances, rapes, murders and/or attacks of women in the US and Australia during the early to mid-1980s. It is suspected that she became one of his many victims. However, her body has never been found.

To add salt to their wounds, Wilder was no stranger to the Kenyon family. They personally knew Wilder. He had met Beth in 1982 when he was photographing contestants in the Miss Florida Pageant. He had visited their winter home several times, even going to dinner with the family on occasion. However, put off by his marriage proposal on their very first date, Beth was firm with Wilder in keeping their relationship as a casual friendship.

Her parents exhausted every avenue, even hiring psychics. Unfortunately, they died not knowing what happened to their daughter.

28,Afraid-Emotion-5102,[],1642723656,"This unsolved murder has always seemed to me like one of missed opportunities in getting justice for Emer, and in certain ways, it seems that the Garda Siochana, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, with respect to apprehending her killer.

Emer was originally from Ennistymon, County Clare, and was aged 23 at the time of her death.
She was an artist, and was studying at a college in Galway, and had just been accepted to the National College of Art and Design (NCAD) in Dublin around the time of her death.

She and her boyfriend had been living in a caravan, on his family's land, to save costs and put a bit of money towards building a house of their own. This caravan site was located in Ballybornagh, Tubber, close to the County Clare/County Galway border.
Prior to this, they had spent time travelling around the world.

On the caravan site they lived on, there was a man going by the name of John Griffin, from the Mervue area of Galway City.

On 8th April 2005, her boyfriend went off to work, and she had mentioned going to Griffins caravan, to get her mobile phone charged.

On that day she was off, as her college was closed, due to the funeral of pope John Paul 2nd.

Her boyfriend received a phone call, to say a caravan at the site was in fire. When he got there, Emma was missing, her car and dogs were still there, but John Griffins caravan was burnt to the ground.

The local authorities came out, and they found some human remains where John Griffins caravan had been. These would later be identified as Emma's.

Initially, the post mortem couldn't ascertain her cause of death, leaving her family in a form of limbo, but in 2010, her body was exhumed, and another post mortem carried out, coming to the conclusion that she had suffered severe injuries prior to the fire breaking out in the caravan, and her case was upgraded to a murder case.

John Griffin was Initially questioned by police, claiming that he hadn't been at his caravan, and slept elsewhere the night before.

Griffins behaviour afterwards was erratic, and suspect.
Two days after initially being questioned, he barricaded himself in Dun Aengus Fort on Inishmore. He was eventually overpowered, and admitted to a psychiatric hospital, before he discharged himself, changed his appearance and went back on a ferry to Inish Mor. 

A pile of his clothes were placed on the edge of a cliff, to apparently make it look like suicide. The Gardai believes that he faked his own death, and has been drifting around Europe on assumed identities.

There are various stories online about John Griffin, hinting about his background, but apart from the fact that he's from Mervue, there's little to be gleamed about him.

Supposedly he's on the interpol website (can't find him on it), and a recent article has her father stating that he was seen in Morocco. Her family have believed over the years that Griffin has been protected by people connected to him.

29,Main_Initiative,[],1642711332,"**Saturday marks 15 years since Karen Bodine was murdered; her nude body posed and left near a Washington state gravel pit. Who Killed Karen Bodine?** 

[Karen Bodine ](https://uncovered.com/cases/karen-bodine)was a 37-year-old mother of three living in Olympia, Washington. She was loving and creative–known to streak her hair with pink highlights and leave secret notes in her kid’s school notebooks as a way to let them know she was thinking of them. While she struggled with substance abuse; her family and friends remember her as a loving mother, daughter, and friend.

**The last time Karen was seen alive.** On Sunday, January 21, 2007, Karen was wandering through the streets of Lacey, Washington when a neighbor noticed her and called the police. When police arrived, Karen [brushed them off ](https://www.chronline.com/stories/woman-is-homicide-victim-sheriffs-office-says,214717)telling them she was fine, despite not wearing a winter coat despite the cold. After lots of insisting, the officer left. At the time Karen was staying with a friend, she had left her parent's home after an intense domestic [incident with her boyfriend, resulting in a protection order](https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/crime/article237646739.html).

The next day, Monday, January 22, Karen was staying with that same friend and many other house guests at the time who were known to do drugs. They [reported seeing her around 3 AM when she left the house on foot](https://thecinemaholic.com/karen-bodine-murder-how-did-she-die-who-killed-her/). This would be the last time Karen would be seen alive. 

**When she was discovered.** The next morning on [January 23, 2007, Karen’s nude body was discovered](https://uncovered.com/cases/karen-bodine/timeline) at the entrance of a gravel pit on Little Rock Road in Rochester, Washington— approximately 30 miles from her home. A witness would tell police they saw a small, brown early 1980s Datsun with a lighter color camper shell seen around 7:50 am at the gravel road entrance. Despite being found in an unnatural position, investigators determined that there were no signs of sexual assault but she was strangled; but her body was left in a position that would suggest that that the murdered “[wanted the shock value](https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/who-killed-karen-bodine-the-vicious-murder-of-the-mother-of-three-remains-unsolved).” 

Additionally, Karen was completely nude with a ligature around her neck. Multiple DNA profiles were identified on the ligature and sent off for testing–which has still not been shared to this day. Law enforcement is hoping advancements in DNA technology will result in answers. The detective in the case is quoted as saying: “...[when you have a case that has as little evidence as this one does and has gone on as long as it has, more than one person was probably involved."" ](https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/who-killed-karen-bodine-the-vicious-murder-of-the-mother-of-three-remains-unsolved)

**Where the case stands today.** It’s been15 years and Karen’s case remains unsolved, but her children are still actively fighting for answers for their mother. In 2019, her children participated in a CrimeCon sponsored event aimed at sharing details of her case with the public in hopes of finding additional information, and earlier this year her case was featured on ""Still a Mystery: A Community Betrayal"" on the ID Channel. Her daughter Karlee also maintains several [billboards in the area where she was last seen](https://www.nbcrightnow.com/news/cold-case-files-five-more-minutes/article_1415a260-383b-11eb-a241-db60e92c7713.html) hoping someone will come forward with information.

But all these years later her family is still left wondering: who killed Karen? Was she a victim of a random attack or something more sinister? Can the DNA collected at the scene lead to answers? If you have any information regarding Karen's case, please call Crime Stoppers of the South Sound at (800) 222-TIPS (8477) or Detective Mickey Hamilton at (360) 786-5279.

The link above is a great write up, so definitely check it out. I don’t want to rehash what has already been said, but I want to bring awareness to a cold case in my area.

I live less than an hour from the campus of IWU, and had never heard of this case until yesterday. I was listening to a new podcast I found and was shocked to hear about it. The podcast host (Megan Musgraves) was abducted at 9 years old by one of the initial suspects (Grenier) in Tricia’s case. He is referred to as the One Armed Man. 

Short summary of Tricia’s case: 1993, she was a freshman at Indiana Wesleyan University. She was walking to a supermarket for refreshments during a study break and was never heard from again. It was one of the warmest days in March and she had gone running that day, she was an avid runner. They believe her run is the reason the dogs got confused when trying to follow her trail. 

A man in the community told police some boys had been playing basketball at the time she went missing, but these boys were never identified. This man provided proof of people playing basketball because he had his video camera that caught the audio of the basketball court, no video footage of the boys though. None of the boys have came forward either. 

Larry Hall is now considered the prime suspect and is in prison for life on unrelated charges. It is believed he may have killed upwards of 40 young girls in the Midwest, but it has never been proven. He has a twin brother, Gary, whom he traveled with for civil war re-enactments. These travels often coincided with missing girls from Nevada, Missouri to Ohio, and as far north as Wisconsin. Larry has an IQ of roughly 80, and many believe that Gary (or another accomplice) had to have helped with the killings, if they happened because of his lower intelligence level.

33,j0nd0,[],1642678576,"I’m not hugely involved on Reddit… usually just lurking around and reading, but I’ve been set on a path to figure out what the hell happened here after consuming tons of media coverage going over this investigation. 

Theresa Corley was murdered in December of 1978 at the age of 19. It’s been 43 years now and there’s a lot to go through, but her sister Gerri believes she is just a few small pieces of information away from closing the case. 

The more I delved into this, the more aggravated I got. The connections between those mostly likely responsible, people of influence within the town, and authorities overseeing the investigation, make it hard to believe all the screw ups are simply due to incompetence. 

My full write up for this case would rival that of a lengthy Ph.D. dissertation, but a summary can be found below. After hearing about what happened, I’ve been borderline obsessed… wracking my brain, trying to figure out which one of the many suspects it was, that took her life. The rapists? The drug dealing boyfriend? A person from town with wealth and influence? There are so many possibilities… but I think it goes without saying, that someone who’s still around is holding something back.


Summary

On December 8, 1978, Bellingham Police received a call informing them that a man had found a deceased female along I-495 North. While police were responding to the scene, a man entered the station asking if Theresa’s body had been found. This was odd, as officers hadn’t even began their investigation yet. How could this man know this?

Once on scene, officers located the nude remains of a white female, later identified as Theresa Corley, with her clothing and shoes left beside her. She had been strangled to death via ligature strangulation.

During the investigation, authorities learned that the man who called in the information leading them to Theresa had given a fake name, causing some to believe that the man who came into the station was also the one who had called, but this was never confirmed. 

As the timeline of what happened to Theresa was pieced together, investigators learned the following. 

She had been celebrating her boyfriends birthday at a bar in Franklin, Ma when they got into a fight and she left on foot. 

She was later picked up by four men (some sources say three) who brought her to the Presidential Arms apartment where she was sexually assaulted. 

Once she was able to make her way out of the apartment, she was picked up by two different men who transported her short distances towards her destination (home). 

She was dropped off in front of the Bellingham Police station by the second driver, but never went inside. 

She was then last seen alive outside of a Dairy Queen, located only a short distance from the police station, around 5:30 am. 

Throughout the investigation, valuable pieces of evidence have been either lost or destroyed. 

At this time, authorities are supposedly in possession of “items” they are testing for DNA. 

This case has been touched on in this sub, some 4 years ago. Links to those posts below.

According to [Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/diane-theresa-francis), Francis was last seen by her daughters in Melbournce, Florida sometime in June 2003. She was arrested for trespassing in Jacksonville, Florida on November 27, 2005, and was last seen when she was released the next day. This is the last indication of her whereabouts. At the time of her disappearance, she had a ""high risk"" lifestyle and was transient throughout southeast Florida.

She has never been heard from again, and her daughters hired a private investigators who was unable to locate her. A former boyfriend reported Francis missing in 2015. Few details are available in her case, but her determined daughter has spent years piecing together every clue she could find.

This is Sherri Lynn's original FB post (edit: I removed the link because it breaks the sub's rules) where she tells the whole story.

*There is some speculation that she may or may not have experienced some physical/sexual abuse as a child, but nothing has ever been confirmed to date. Diane grew up with both of her parents up until about the age of 12 when they decided to divorce; Rosalie Lamonto is her mother and her father is David Leslie Francis Sr.*

*Diane was always a Daddy's girl growing up and decided to live with her father in Florida when her parents separated. Diane also has two younger Brothers David Leslie Francis Jr, and Michael J.Francis. They chose to move to Florida with their father as well.*

*My mother was believed to be a mostly well behaved child up until about the age of 12 or so when her brothers (David and Michael) told their mother that Diane had been “sneaking boys in and out of the house in the middle of the night.” Nothing has been confirmed about this accusation either.*

*My mother went on to graduate from 8th grade and continued on normally for the next year. When my mother reached high school she became a drop dead gorgeous young woman, boys were constantly pursuing her. At this point she began to drift far far away from the once normal and well behaved child she once was. Her father recalls her “getting in with the wrong crowd” One of these boys she chose to hang out with even got her pregnant at 16 years old ( possibly Kenny Feckowitz).*

*My mother would later give birth to this baby prematurely in the hospital bathroom. This baby was my sister “ Stephanie Francis”. She was born and died on April 11,1985. She had a proper burial and was laid to rest in Denville, NJ at the Denville Cemetery. Different encounters from Stephanie's birth time period tell numerous different stories, some say my mother was devastated and that she never came back from this, others say she showed no remorse or connection to the child whatsoever.*

*In the year 1990,( just five years after the passing of my sister Stephanie). My mother would meet my biological father Charles Edward Snider, (the night of my fathers birthday 1990, at a bar in long branch NJ.) My father also says my mother was in a relationship already at that time but her boyfriend (Kenny) was away so they got together secretly. Just one year after my mother and father met my sister Jessica Marie Snider was born September 22nd,1991 in Morristown New Jersey.*

*My Birthday would follow not too far behind hers. I was born in Long Branch New Jersey on June 15th, 1993. Somewhere in between the birth of my sister and my mother's pregnancy with me she would take a turn for the worse. My father claims while my mother was pregnant with me she started doing drugs and partying as well as cheating and not coming home some nights. This came as a shock to me as in the 28 years I’ve been alive I have yet to hear that I was a “drug baby” (but I’d believe pretty much anything at this point.)*

*My mother and father would continue to live in New Jersey moving here to there in order to make ends meet, staying with family whenever possible. Eventually they would end up in the state of Florida in the year 1994.*

*My mother said she had it with New Jersey and claimed she wanted to be near her father again. (just 1 year after I was born) My father claims they moved the family here in order to be closer to my grandfather Dave and step-Grandmother Rita Cook (per my mother's request). Little did they know this might be the move that set my mother's fate.*

*Just one year after their move to the state of Florida, they end up in a trailer park where my mother would meet a man by the name of John Schmitt. She told my father “I'm going to marry John and he's going to be the girl's father now”. In a sense she was telling my father she didn't want to see him anymore.*

*My dad then moved back to New Jersey to be back home with his family. We never saw him again. My mother met John Schmitt in 1995. My father Charles Snider claims my mother started seeing John while she was still dating him. The relationship between John Scmitt and my mother was a happy one at times but like every place we would soon end up, my mother let the drugs get the best of her and for the most part….us too because she had lost us again.*

*When my mother met John Boggs it was 1997 just two years later and he had just served a four year sentence in prison, and he was fresh out the day that they met. My mother was actually dating one of his former friends at that time. Daniel Irwin, the man my mother was dating at the time, was also the manager of some apartments that John Boggs' family owned (Hired by John himself).*

*John was returning from prison to pick back up managing the property for his family. John claims he swooped in like a hawk and stole my mother from his buddy. (Daniel Irwin) This was now the beginning of another shaky and mysterious relationship. We would soon return to my mother's care and begin a life with her and John Boggs.*

*In the year 1999 My mother was still living with John Boggs. John was an abusive man and also a man who fell madly in love with my mother. I recall him throwing her across the house on one occasion which also included him punching his fists through the door to get to her, my sister and I jumping on him kicking and screaming to try and help my mother. Drugs were always present with the two of them together.*

*My mother always denied the abuse to police in order to continue on as if nothing had happened and keep her place to live for us kids.There were good times as well, i don't neglect the facts here but the situation as a whole was a nightmare to say the least. My mother was tired and the police were called this same year in response to her trying to commit suicide because she had lost us girls again…... John Boggs and my mother had a history and I don't quite know everything that entails but he gave her his tattooed initials as a gift and they were always inseparable when things were good.(We’ll definitely get back to John Boggs but he goes silent on this case until the year 2015!!)*

*Roger Foreman was driving down the road one day in or around the year 2000 just one year later. He was in his work van (he ran a landscape business) and he spotted my mother on the side of the road walking, he stopped her so he could speak to her. She said she had just gotten into a huge fight with her crazy boyfriend at the time (John Boggs) and she explained she did not want to go back home to him... That was the beginning of their relationship right then and there. We soon were allowed to visit with my mother once again.*

*John would often show up at our house looking for my mother and in turn this would cause physical fights with Roger Sr. Roger Foreman Sr. had a son of his own and things were seeming to be looking up for the most part. We spent a lot of time with Roger Sr, his son and my mother (mostly on Arranged supervised visits) this continued until we were allowed to go home to my mom”permanently“.*

*My mom was happy again and always joking, almost back to her normal “Di-Di” self in a sense. (Apparently Roger had lost his son in the past and offered his caseworkers contact information to my mother in order for my mother to work on getting my sister and I back into her care as well). I felt like it had been no time and we were back with my mom again and trying to never look back from it, but it was surely not the end….*

*In late 2003 Jessica and I were removed from my mother's care for the last and final time. We lived in the IndianRiver Cottages.(they were these awful bright pink, one room, 1 bed shacks). Jessica and I spent the majority of our time while living here in the trailer park down the road with friends or in the neighborhood that surrounded our loop of run down hotel rooms. I remember smoking cigarettes with the kid next door all the time or just basically doing whatever we wanted. Going inside our house was a rare occasion.*

*In 2003 our caseworker pulled up to the cottage where we lived. We were so traumatized by this point that when our case worker showed up to remove us this time…... we ran for our lives, because this time we knew. We took one look at each other swung open the back door of our shack and off into the woods we both went tripping over one another screaming as if it would help in some way. We knew what was happening.*

*All in the same moment so many thoughts crossed my 10 year old mind. “Three strikes you're out mom” “this is it” “don't look back” I remember jessica telling me we should go to our friends house and i'll never forget turning around and seeing my mom being put into a police car and knowing that was the last time i may ever see her again. When we reached our destination…. Our friend's mother ended up having to call DCF in order to protect herself (understandable). We were only about 9 &amp; 11 years old.*

*Jessica and I now had to re-enter the Florida foster care system. We lived in multiple homes, some really good and some bad. I won't go into full detail as I don't remember it all but my sister and I experienced a wide variety of homes from shelters to facilities, overnight arrangements, relative care, adoptive placements, respite care. On the flip side there were Amazing homes in south Florida that I will never ever forget. Part of why I’m a somewhat structured and steady headed human being is from my Foster mom’s Joanne, Alice, Denise, Dedra, Sheila, Maryellen,Joanie, Allison and Ms. Liz. These women are forever a part of me.*

*I just won’t deny the bad side of it all either. We once slept on the dcf office floor because there were no homes available at the time that would accept two pre-teen girls.( we weren't exactly top of the line product for foster parents) I remember being lost in the Florida foster care system at one point and looking back it means so much more now than it ever did to me then. I was just a number on a bed. We all were.*

*The Florida foster care system failed my sister and I in a major way. Years ago they had my entire family convinced (including my father) that we were going to be happily adopted and that they should basically stay away from us. This has never been nor was this ever the case.*

*At this time Jessica and I were at an all girls ranch in Cocoa Beach Florida and had not been checked on by any caseworker in weeks. We experienced several “Adoptive Placements'' but none of them ever worked out. Jessica and I went on like this until about 2008, where we found ourselves in an all girls shelter with some pretty strict rules on not contacting biological families.*

*One night, I finally took a stand and stole a phone book from the office in the shelter we had just been dropped off in. I searched all night and finally found one name “Rita may Cook.” I didn't know why i recognized this name or what it meant but I knew I had to try it.*

*I shakely picked up the phone trying to be as quiet as I could (what I was doing was illegal) I dialed that number twenty times and twenty times over I erased it, racking my brain for any memory of this woman and how I might have known her. Finally it hit me, “Rita may cook, Rita may not” something my mother always joked about.*

*This was the woman I called grandma my whole life. I remember my hand hitting the call button without a moment to second guess my decision and the phone was ringing…..ringing…..ringing…&amp; then...I heard her.”h-hello…..w-who is this?” a raspy startled voice answers…( it was late)…. I say hesitantly…. “Its sherri”….. “Sherri who?” she replies…. “ Sherri Lynn Snider” I say. Before she says anything else I can hear tons of rustling and then she yells “DAAAVVEEEEE” calling out to my Grandfather (David Francis) from across the house.*

*After years of being seperated i had found them. This was it. This was my fight ending…..this was my worry leaving… this was everything I had ever hoped for. This was my FAMILY!…...my mommy.*

*We were holding a yard sale at the shelter so I invited my grandfather and the next day he showed up. The hilarity of it all was that we found out they lived 1 street over and had lived there since I was a little girl. After 9 years of being separated we were randomly placed from 3 hrs away,…1 block from my mother’s fathers home....But again, this was not the end of my journey to find my mother.*

*Later it would be discovered that my family had no idea of my mothers current whereabouts. They had not even the slightest bit of answers for us and so……we were completely shattered all over again. Before we knew it we were in relative care with my Aunt Joanne Francis in 2008-09. We both aged out of the Florida foster care system at 18 years old. This didn't happen for me until the year 2009-2010. This is when all of my “Real” searching began….*

*A few Years ago I discovered some odd information but, it was too little too late. This usually happened with my mother’s situation. I found an alias, a traffic citation, numerous police reports, I obtained my mothers last mugshot, court records, arrest records, and I also ran lengthy internet paid and free searches. None of which led me to any current information regarding my mothers current or even most recent whereabouts.*

*I found my mother’s best friend whom we all lived with around the time we last saw my mother but by the time I found her, she had already passed away a year prior to finding her. I found her best friends daughters also who were just little babies (4 years old) when all of this happened and had been taken away as well at the same time we were taken. Everything that has ever existed regarding my mother Diane Theresa Francis or her alias, existed during or before the year 2005 possibly 2006.*

*I hate to admit the facts here but it's been almost 20 long long years of me hoping, praying, wishing my mother would just commit a crime or call/show up… Mess up…something…...anything. But she Doesn’t. I contacted each and every one of my mother’s former boyfriends and got different recollections from each one.*

*One boyfriend was long gone and out of the picture by the time she disappeared. Her last known boyfriend claims to have left her at some type of boarding house right near the house we last saw her in around 2004-2005.*

*Another One of her boyfriends claims he has no idea. I guess My first “ real “ &amp; official attempt at locating my mother would have had to have been in 2009-2010. This was the year we reunited with our “entire” family and had asked them where she was.*

*The answers we received were vague and scattered. “We had Cop friends of ours look for her and the trail ended in Palm Bay, Florida” &amp; “We did everything we could for her,she didn’t want help” and my most favorite “You need to let it go.” From then on, I made it my mission and mine alone to do whatever it takes to find her.*

*I contacted the Florida department of children and families’ services and also my prior caseworker (Beatrice Borsiquot) in order to obtain my foster care case file. They still will not release the entire thing to me stating that I would have to go there in person to obtain it in its entirety and I’ve been told it will be destroyed soon as well.*

***I made numerous calls to the Melbourne, Palm Bay and Jacksonville Florida police departments and sheriff's offices as well as jails (with efforts in mind of filing a missing persons report). I was laughed at…. multiple times. I was told that my mother is a full well grown adult and can make her own decisions.*** *If she is not under a certain age, In immediate danger, a danger to others, taken against her own will, suicidal and a few other things then she can choose to disappear and there’s nothing I or anyone else can do.*

*They advised me she hadn’t been in the area in years anyways.* ***They asked me on my birthday 2019 “is something wrong ma’am why do you seem so upset about your mother?” I hung up the phone. My mouth couldn’t even express the amount of emotion that was going through my heart at that moment and it all just came out as sobs…. “I’m so upset” because my mother, the woman who gave me breath and life to breathe has not been seen in almost two decades and no one can seem to see the immediate issue with that but me.***

*At this point I’m offended; I start posting to Facebook more and more. I start adding anyone and everyone with my last name or my mother’s last name. I find an awesome cousin of mine who happens to be a crime junkie living in the same state as my bio father (Maggie Snider) . She came to visit me and we went to the crime junkie showduring her visit here in Arizona. We met Sarah turney and Erin Reed after the show for drinks. I then feature on “Sipping on Some Crime Podcast”. This would be the first of many episode interviews to follow.*

*I started contacting the provided emails from police websites for public records requests. I entered requests with Brevard county and Jacksonville duval county. I found an alias just by searching her jail number alone with no other info included (on inmate websites). I obtained a copy of the FDLE records request. During all of the record requests and paying for online reports from radaris and people searches.*

*The trail always ends in the same exact location. 5624 Cagle Rd in Jacksonville, Florida. The location was previously a Ramada Inn and is now an Econolodge. My sister and I sent a good friend from our old church and his friend who is a licensed PI to these locations in Melbourne and in Jacksonville. I have the conclusion from those findings and they were what I’ve already sent you. Not to mention the PI was given everything that I also gave you prior to making this venture to search for my mom.*

*All in all his findings were that I need to personally go to Jacksonville where my mother frequented and walk the streets of US1 to find her. He looked every which way up down left right backwards and sideways in the systems he has access to and found the same things I did. Less even.*

***Today the case is ice cold and I’m left with bits and pieces of half ass answers.*** *no one remembers anything and better yet they want nothing to do with the repercussions and or history they’d have to face in order to be even slightly involved.* ***Every single day that passes is such a heartbreak to me, my sister and those who know what a beautiful person my mother truly is because I know this life is so so short. I can only hope that my life will just be long enough to discover what truly happened to my beautiful mother Diane Theresa Francis.***

*Side note: In the year 2015, (16 years after dating and beating my mother.) John Taylor Boggs calls the Jacksonville Sheriff's office and asks if he can report someone missing. He proceeds to tell the sheriffs office that Diane is his former friend and he hasn't seen her in “12” years, and he is “worried” about her.*

*He claims he is the step father of my sister and I and he hopes my mother is okay. He also proceeds to tell the sheriff's office defining facts about my mother, including her drug habits, tattoos, hair color etc. mind you this call was made one day apart from the day his neighbor and friend George Contos goes missing and is also reported missing. I’ve since found another missing individual associated with my mother’s ex boyfriend.* *Sherri Lynn Snider*

35,BuscandoMemo,[],1642648682," A team of citizen cold case sleuths diving in a river Wednesday found a car that matches the description of a vehicle belonging to a woman who disappeared in 2017. Police have not yet positively identified the car as belonging to Stephanie Torres, who went missing in 2017, but her family members are standing by in hopes of having their questions answered. Waco police, on hand at Brazos Park East on Wednesday, were investigating whether the blue and gray 2006 Kia Rio found by divers with Adventures With Purpose  belonged to Torres. 

Torres was days from celebrating her 43rd birthday when she disappeared. She was last seen leaving her home on Dec. 20, 2017, but did not take her cellphone, wallet or medication with her. 

The car was found in the cold, murky waters of the Brazos River in Cameron Park about an hour after the dive began. “I’m scared. I’m nervous. I don’t have words at this point,” daughter Bianca Torres said as the search for the car unfolded.

Adventures With Purpose, which Oregon-based scuba diver Jared Leisek founded, conducted the search in the Brazos River after connecting with the family via social media last year. The group originally organized environmental cleanup dives before turning to searching for missing people.

36,josiahpapaya,[],1642624516,"I’m only sharing this link as a source, because very few of them exist as of right now. The article is behind a paywall, and F\*k The Star, so I will summarize the case and what revelations are in the article.

For other True Crime nerds, this case has been on our minds for a while.   
 

In 2017, the 12th richest people in Canada, Barry and Honey Sherman were executed in their Toronto home (they were hung). There are three major theories about the murder, and although the case is still unsolved, investigators believe the evidence they have acquired heavily points toward one.   

**Theory One (unlikely):**   

**The kids did it.** The Shermans had a turbulent relationship with each other, but seemed to be okay around the time of the murder. Documents reveal that the estate was split equally between all of the kids. The kids have also hired their own private investigation teams to look into the case. None of them are persons of interests. Rich kids killing their parents seems to be a thing, but probably not in this case.

**Theory Two (unlikely, yet troubling):**   

**Honey Sherman (and probably Barry) was a racist.** Relatives of the Shermans describe her as a women who did not care about ‘political correctness’ and openly used derogatory language toward people of Middle-Eastern / Arabic / Muslim background. The home they were assassinated in was under construction at the time, with many ethnically diverse people frequently coming-and-going. One theory to support this is that the Shermans employed a full staff for their home, including a concierge and they were notoriously lazy about security, often not even turning on their cameras or activating alarms. The killer appeared to know this, and the layout of the home. What makes this theory unlikely is that Honey is believed to have not been the intended target but just ended up being there at the wrong time.  
 

**Theory Three (most likely):**   

**Barry Sherman owed $1 billion to pharmaceutical companies that he was refusing to pay.** He would have easily been able to keep those fees tied up in the legal system until he expired naturally or got out of them altogether (he was 75). He was becoming obstinate as a leader and CEO, was not well-liked at the company and refusing to retire. The fees were the result of Barry’s drug company refusing to pay royalties for selling no-name brand drugs. I don’t have a great understanding of Canadian patent law or the inner-workings of the pharmaceutical industry, but Mega-Pharma (bigger than Big Pharma) were NOT in the Barry Sherman fanclub.    

The theory that Barry was assassinated by Pharma rivals is supported by four years of pouring through his e-mails, texts, business records, diaries and through interviewing coworkers, family and friends. The biggest red flag / smoking gun was that all of Barry’s outstanding debts were settled by the company immediately after his death in a very quiet and expeditious manner. It is likely the case will never be solved, and it’s even possible Barry’s own company assisted in the hitjob. But long-story-short, he was whacked for things related to his business, both as a retaliation but also as a warning to other minor billionaires not to push their luck against the giants.

37,NobreVagabundo,[],1642556483,"Hi! My first post on this sub! With all the sad stories we see here every day, I thought it would be nice to share that this devastating case was finally solved after six years. I'm not a native english speaker, please don't mind any miswritten words or so.

Basically, Beatriz Angélica was a 7 year old girl that was found dead with stab wounds at a school in the Brazilian city of Petrolina, back in 2015. The whole story was already posted, so please go here in case you're not familiar with it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/i6kc96/the\_strange\_case\_of\_the\_7\_year\_old\_girl\_that\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/i6kc96/the_strange_case_of_the_7_year_old_girl_that_was/)

Beatriz's parents never gave up on finding the person responsible for their daughter's death. In December 2021, they walked more than 430 miles, between Petrolina and Recife, to seek justice. The act lasted 23 days and had the support of municipal authorities and residents of the cities through which they passed.

On January 11 2022, more than six years after the murder, Pernambuco Scientific Police determined that the DNA found on the knife left at the crime scene belongs to Marcelo da Silva, 40, who is in prison for other crimes since 2017. His DNA was part of the State Bank of Genetic Profiles.

Marcelo confessed to the murder and was indicted after being heard by delegates. According to the Secretary of Social Defense of Pernambuco, Humberto Freire, Marcelo would be on the outskirts of the school in search of money to leave the city. He had been drinking and had no intention of entering the school or committing any crime (he actually thought it was a church). At the scene, the accused found Beatriz. Seeing that he was carrying a knife, the girl got scared and started screaming; “in the face of this exasperation, the fright she showed, he ended up silencing her with stab wounds”. The Secretary also claims that the crime was not planned and had no accomplices. Still according to him, 10 knife blows were recorded and not 42 as had been reported. 42 is the number of photographs of the stab wounds that appear in the lawsuits, as the wounds are photographed from different angles.

Beatriz's family believe that Marcelo really is the killer, but argue that many questions still need to be answered. Her mother doesn't think the alleged motive for the crime is true.

Today, it was announced that Marcelo wrote a letter stating that he was pressured to confess to the crime. The State Department of Social Defense stated that ""the entire investigation into the murder of the girl Beatriz is being carried out within all legal parameters, with zeal and honesty"".

The police stated that they will continue the investigation and that they will maintain dialogue with the Public Ministry of Pernambuco for the continuity of the process.

38,CherryBlossom724,[],1642554371,"**Background**

Christopher Ruess and Stella Knight married on April 2, 1905. He was a Unitarian minister and she was a dancer and artist. Their first child, Waldo (named after Ralph Waldo Emerson) was born on September 5, 1909. A second son, Everett (named after the author and historian Edward Everett Hale), was born on March 28th, 1914, in Oakland, California. 

Both Stella and Christopher had a deep love of books and of art, which they imparted to their children. They were avid diarists as well and encouraged both of their sons to not only keep a diary themselves, but to also copy out long passages from their respective diaries in letters home when they were separated from their parents. 

In September 1918, the family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts, because Christopher had decided to take a job with the Chautauqua Industrial Art Desk Company. When Stella’s father became ill, she and Everett traveled across the country by train to Los Angeles to care for him. Along the way, they made several stops at memorable locations such as the Grand Canyon and the Yosemite Valley. Everett was nine at the time and began keeping his first diary during this trip. His earliest writings showed his growing fascination with nature and his love of traveling. As Everett grew a little older, he also developed a passion for writing poetry and painting. He was even able to sell some of his watercolor paintings from time to time. 

Everett graduated high school in 1931. Though his parents very much wanted him to attend college, Everett had other ideas. That same year, Everett went off on his first solo adventure, hiking and camping out in the wilderness, as well as keeping a detailed diary about his feelings and experiences, and writing frequent letters to his family. He also loved visiting Anasazi ruins and collecting artifacts from these sites. Thus began his pattern of hitchhiking, camping, and hiking for months at a time before briefly returning home, only to leave once again, starting the cycle anew. He met many people along the way during these solo trips, but a certain shyness and inherent desire for solitude kept him from forming connections with most of the people he encountered during his travels, a fact which he sometimes lamented in his diaries. He tried to support himself by selling paintings, but because he was rarely able to make a sale (and keep in mind that this was during the Great Depression), his expeditions were mostly financed by his parents. 

Everett adopted a small and adorable brown and white dog named Curly, from a Navajo Reservation in 1931, to have as a companion. He also always had either a pair of burros or a pair of horses to accompany him out in the wilderness. 

Everett suffered from frequent periods of dark moods, which some have theorized may have actually been depressive episodes. In a letter to his older brother Waldo in 1931, Everett alluded to having been suicidal the previous summer. 

&gt; Whatever I have suffered in the months past has been nothing compared with the beauty in which I have steeped my soul, so to speak. It has been a priceless experience–and I am glad it is not over. What I would have missed if I had ended everything last summer!

On September 8th, 1933, Everett was stung by bees at least a dozen times in addition to already being covered in poison oak blisters. In his attempt to escape the bees, he fell into Goddard Creek, but was in so much pain and was feeling so lethargic that he struggled to find the strength to pull himself out of the water and nearly drowned. 

However, by 1934 and particularly in the weeks leading up to his disappearance, he was seemingly in very good spirits and doing better than ever before. In his letters to his parents, he spoke of having “great fun” with the locals and even alluded to having come into quite a bit of cash recently (though he never elaborated on the source of this money) and stated that he now had “more money than I need”. Also, for the first time ever, he sent money home to help his parents out. 

**Disappearance**

On November 21st, 1934, two sheepherders named Addlin Lay and Clayton Porter, encountered Everett on the Hole-in-the-Rock trail, where they were camping. According to them, they offered Everett a quarter of mutton, but he declined, saying that he had plenty of food. They then watched as Everett and his burros, Cockleburrs and Chocolatero, made their way southeast, towards Davis Gulch. This was the last time anyone is known to have seen Everett Ruess. 

Though almost two months had gone by since Everett’s family had heard from him, they didn’t think much of it to begin with, as Everett had warned them back in the fall that he may not be near a post office for a month or two. However, by late January they were becoming concerned. Their alarm only heightened when they received their own letters to Everett back in the mail, the envelopes still sealed. They began writing letters to every postmaster in every town in the southwest that Everett was known to have visited. When this yielded no answers as to where their son was, they started writing to sheriffs, traders, newspapers, radio stations, and Indian agents. But no one had seen Everett in months or knew anything of his current whereabouts.

**The Search**

Finally, on March 1st, months after that last sighting back in November, a search party was formed. A man named Jennings Allen, along with a dozen other local men, headed into Davis Gulch on horseback hoping to find some sign of Everett or what had become of him. They turned up nothing until March 6th, when they found Cockleburrs and Chocolatero, Everett’s burros, in a corral. There are discrepancies in the accounts of the searchers as to the condition these burros were found in though, with some claiming that they were “thin and emaciated”, while others said that they were “fat and healthy”. 

Nearby, in a natural alcove, they found what was presumed to have been Everett’s final campsite. There were footprints, Anasazi potsherds, candy wrappers, empty cans and an impression in the dirt from a bedroll. Notably absent from this site were Everett’s money, camping gear, cooking equipment, paintings and art supplies, and his 1934 journal. They also discovered two different spots in Davis Gulch where “Nemo 1934” had been etched into the rock. “Nemo”, Latin for “nobody”, is a pseudonym that Everett was known to have adopted and so it is assumed that he’s the one who made these inscriptions. Both inscriptions are now under water and have been since 1957, when the waters of Lake Powell rose during the construction of Glen Canyon Dam.

Beyond this, nothing more would ever be found that would shed light on what happened to Everett Ruess.

**Additional Information**

* There was a rumor in Escalante, a nearby town, that Everett had been robbed and murdered by local cattle rustlers who mistook him for a government agent. By 1934, cattle rustling was becoming rampant in this area and due to this, the Cattlemen’s Association spread a false rumor that an undercover government investigator had been sent out to the area. As the story goes, Everett arrived in town shortly thereafter.

* A Navajo man named Aneth Nez told his granddaughter (Daisy) a story in 1971 about witnessing a young white man being chased and then murdered by Ute Indians near Comb Ridge in the mid-1930’s. After the Utes left, Nez buried the body. Remains were eventually found in that area, but DNA testing confirmed that they did not belong to Everett. 

* In the 1970’s, a tourist found bones wedged in a crack in Davis Gulch. The bones seemed to indicate that the person had suffered a broken hip and a fractured collar bone. He turned over the bones to a National Park Service ranger, who in turn gave them to his supervisor. However, shortly after this the bones went missing and have never been found.

**Theories**

* Accidental death, perhaps due to a fall or drowning.

* Murder

* Suicide

**\*TW: SUICIDE, LARVAE AND RAZORS ARE MENTIONED\***  


I apologize in advance for the lack of information since there's only one thread in a Swedish forum, one podcast episode and one paywalled Swedish article about this.  


[Upphittat lik Esrange 1979.](https://www.flashback.org/t1000184p1)  
[Mysteriet: Vem var den döde mannen?](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/8wXq7x/vem-var-den-dode-mannen)  
[Den döde ingen saknar – Besynnerliga Berättelser – Lyssna här](https://podtail.se/podcast/besynnerliga-berattelser/den-dode-ingen-saknar/)  
(his police sketch is used in the thumbnail for the podcast, it cannot be found anywhere else on the internet)  


43 years ago, 20-25 kilometres (15 miles) from Kiruna and 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the nearest town a man's body was found deep in the woods near space base Esrange.  
This was deep into the forest, there were no actual roads around there and it was impossible to get around without a vehicle.  
During this season the ice had started to melt as well so you couldn't cross any rivers, etc.  


There are conflicting statements as to who found the body, the newspaper says:  


&gt;*A road worker knew that something was wrong when he saw footprints along the newly built forest road.*  
*Who had been walking around there? This was not a place where people walked around on foot.*  
*The police were called on June 11th 1979, they started following the footsteps for a few kilometres and then they found him.*

The podcast has a snippet of a radio rapport from 1979 where they say that two fishermen found the body on June 12th 1979.  


The man had long blond/light brown hair, 177 cm tall (5'9""), except for his period-appropriate sideburns, he was clean-shaven.  
Eye colour could not be determined due to decomposition. It is estimated that he was there for about a month, there was fly/larvae activity on the body.  
One of his front teeth were knocked out.  
He was dressed in cowboy boots, jeans, an anorak shirt, six t-shirts and a blue windbreaker which is very unusual since it gets very cold during the spring nights in Kiruna.  
In his left jean pocket, there was both Swedish and Danish currency.  
In total, he had 134 SEK (14 dollars).  


Beside the body were the remnants of a campfire, bloody teabags, a bloody toilet-roll, a glass, a coffee pot, two broken matchboxes, a strong rope that was 5 mm (0,1 inches) broad 6,5 metres (21 feet) long, burned blue finger gloves, some sugar and a pack of band-aids.  
The man had no ID or other papers that could help with the identification.  
The police were shocked because people that hike there aren't usually poorly equipped especially when they hike as long as he did.  


When they moved his body upside down there was a white box with Gillette razor blades in it. Two of them were used, and on the white box, there were bloodstains.  
The box was found on the ground under the left hip.  
On the right wrist, there was a cut about 5 cm (almost 2 inches) long and 1 cm (0,3 inches) wide. There were cuts on the left arm as well.  
The cuts were too superficial to cause his death.  
The coroner determined that he had died of hypothermia.  
It's estimated that he was closer to the younger end of the age range.  
There were no signs of foul play.  
He was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  


Conflicting information again.  
According to the article, there were no cars around the area and no one came forward about giving the man a lift despite the case being highly publicised.  
A policeman said: ""If he had not walked there, perhaps all the way from Kiruna, someone would've noticed him. People are very vigilant in these areas and it's quite noticeable if someone is walking there along the way but no one had seen the man"".  


The podcast says that some people thought they saw him and that a couple had offered the walking man a ride to which he just answered ""go"" (as in ""get away from me"").  
They thought that something was up because he was hiking without a backpack, just two bags.  
The man had told people that he was from Switzerland and that he was going to be a doctor in that he hadn’t gotten his license yet.  
He spoke with an accent and broken Swedish but people could understand him.  
But sadly, when the couple was shown a picture of the man, despite the decomposition, they said that it wasn't him that they tried to pick up and the cops are back to square one.  


Sometime later a weird letter is left at the train station in Kiruna, addressed to a wanderer that we can call ""Mr Koch"" that back then didn't have an address.  
The train station employees leave it to Swedish authorities and they start following up on the letter. Could the unidentified man be ""Mr Koch""?  
After an investigation, they find out that ""Mr Koch"" is alive and well in another European country.  
He had simply gone home and forgotten the letter.  


According to the article fingerprints and descriptions (probably of the body and crime scene) were sent to Interpol and then to police in Norway, Finland and Denmark.  
The man got cremated, the things around the body were thrown out and the case got closed since they determined that there was no foul play.  
The only thing left is a folder with papers.  


Could the man have been a spy since he was found near the only space base in Sweden (highly unlikely)? Could the man have been the swiss man the couple had offered a ride to? Could he just have been a depressed man that tried to kill himself and the family hasn't made a connection yet?  
So many questions are left unanswered.  


I personally tend to believe that the fishermen found him since that is said in the police report.  
I also do find it odd that a swiss man was seen in the area around that time and was never seen again, maybe he just changed clothes and burned the other ones since there had been a campfire there? Maybe that's why the couple said it wasn't the man they saw?","John Doe, Kiruna, Sweden, 1979"
40,Afraid-Emotion-5102,[],1642546733,"Barbara Walsh was a married mother of 7 children, aged 33, who lived on rural County Galway, Ireland (Rusheenamanagh, near Carna), at the time of her disappearance.

The last recorded sighting of her was on June 22nd 1985.

The night before, there was a party, where up to a dozen people were present, including two members of the Gardai and a priest.

The party had initially been in a local bar, and ended up back at the Barbara and Dara's house, as Barbara's husbands siblings, Catherine and Patrick, were back home from the USA and Australia respectively, and were having one last meet up before leaving.

One of her teenage daughters got up at 4am on the 22nd June, and remembers seeing her mother sleeping on the sofa, and put a pillow under her head. Barbaras daughter went back to bed after that.

This was the last confirmed sighting of Barbara. When the morning came, Barbara was gone - when they got up, they presumed she went with their father down to the local shops.

When their father Dara returned by himself, they realised that she was missing - a search was begun, but she never turned up.

The police believe that the answers lie in the local gaeltacht community there.

The evidence suggests that Barbara is no longer alive, and going by the interviews that family members have given, they feel its extremely unlikely that she would've walked out on her family.

It seems that many more searches have been done in recent years, but unfortunately no real progress has been made.

[Beverly Ozuna-Ulrich](https://uncovered.com/cases/beverly-ann-ozuna-ulrich), the mother of eight children, was living in Belle Fourche, South Dakota in 2003. A small town of less than 6,000 residents, Belle Forche is about 13 miles from the Wyoming border. A member of the Lakota tribe, Beverly was the youngest of 16 siblings in a large, close-knit family. 

Roughly 14 months [before Beverly disappeared, she had separated from her husband](https://charleyproject.org/case/beverly-ann-ozuna-ulrich). However, she would regularly return to the home to cook and clean for the children. Beverely was last seen leaving her South Dakota home on October 17, 2003 by her estranged husband, Steven. Ten days later on October 27, 2003, her family would report her missing. While Beverly was known to travel unannounced from time to time, she always kept in close contact with her children and her siblings. 

**Two major leads.** In February 2004, authorities were [alerted to a body](https://www.bhpioneer.com/local_news/family-of-missing-belle-fourche-woman-still-searching-after-14-years/article_5bf148ce-b999-11e7-b03a-d31e5a143208.html) that was found along Interstate 90 in South Dakota.

The Monkey Man of New Delhi was an ape like creature that terrorized the capital city of New Delhi, India in 2001.

In May of that year, stories began to circulate in New Delhi of a strange, nocturnal, monkey-like creature that was attacking people. Eyewitness accounts were often inconsistent, but tended to describe the creature as about four feet (120 cm) tall, covered in thick black hair. It supposedly wore a metal helmet, had metal claws, pants, glowing red eyes (sometimes beneath goggles) and three buttons on its chest. Some suggest the Monkey Man is an avatar of the Hindu deity Hanuman, while others claim it is a version of Bigfoot.

Many people reported being scratched, and two (by some reports, three) people even died when they leapt from the tops of buildings or fell down stairwells in a panic caused by the Monkey Man. Eventually, police even issued artist impressions in an attempt to catch the creature.

Shining a bright light in the Monkey Man's face was said to ward him off, as it renders his ""night vision glasses"" ineffective. It was also thought that throwing water on the simian's chest would short-circuit his ""motherboard heart."" In similar fashion, it was believed that the creature could turn invisible with the press of one button on his panel. These theories portray the Monkey Man as something more mechanical than natural.

**Beatriz Joana Von Hohendorff Winck** was 77 years old, she lived in the city of *Portão*, South of Brazil, with her husband Delmar. The couple, who had four children, had been together for about 60 years. One of their favorite activities was participating in excursions.

In October 2012, Beatriz and Delmar went to Aparecida on an excursion with more than 30 people. Before traveling, Beatriz had a check-up and the doctor stated she had no health problems. Her family assumes she was fit to travel. *She didn't have Alzheimer's or any disease that left her with memory lapses*.

**THE PLACE OF DISAPPEARANCE**

The Catedral Basilica Santuário Nacional de Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida, known as ‘Santuário de Aparecida’ is a Catholic religious temple located in the Brazilian municipality of Aparecida, inside the state of São Paulo. It is the largest Catholic temple in Brazil and the second largest in the world, only smaller than the Basilica of Saint Peter, in the Vatican. Aparecida receives around 1 million visitors per month.

[Aparecida's Sanctuary](https://imagens.ebc.com.br/nXP0kPvWgEWceemqGJBPzeG91JA=/1170x700/smart/https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/basilica_of_the_national_shrine_of_our_lady_of_aparecida_2007.jpg?itok=7CiMXyIt)

**The day Beatriz vanished**

When they arrived, Delmar and Beatriz went to the hotel, dropped off their things and went to take a walk around the city. They took a tour of the Sanctuary, which on that day had many visitors. During this tour, they decided to enter a store called ‘Casa das Velas’ which sells religious items inside the Basilica.

“They chose the candles they wanted and headed towards the cashier. But as there was a line, my father asked my mother to wait at the store's exit door, because he would get in line and pay. He saw my mother standing outside, waiting. When it was his turn, he paid and left, but he couldn't find my mother anymore"", says their eldest son, João.

Delmar tried to find his wife, then he spoke to one of the temple’s guards and spoke to acquaintances who took the tour inside the Basilica with them. One of the elderly women said that Beatriz complained of being tired and said she would ""go home"". However, João does not believe that Beatriz has left the sanctuary.

""She wouldn't go to the bathroom without telling my dad. He wouldn't do anything without my mom either. They were very close. When my dad told her to wait outside the store, I'm sure she stood there waiting, but disappeared for some reason"", says João.

Delmar then looked for his wife at the hotel. Only at the beginning of the night did he contact his children to inform them about the disappearance. João took a flight to Aparecida and registered a police report the next day.

**Searches**

The day after the disappearance, João began to lead the search. “We made pamphlets and distributed them in hospitals, nursing homes, under the bridge and everywhere you can imagine within a 100 km radius of Aparecida”. Beatriz’s son even talked to a drug dealer of the region in hopes of finding any clues.

The Sanctuary of Aparecida reported that there were no records that could show the moment when Beatriz disappeared. ""We only got access to the Sanctuary's cameras after 15 days of her disappearance. And that didn't help us at all, because we discovered that the filming there was made one on top of the other. So, nothing was recorded"", explained João.

Some hypotheses about Beatriz's disappearance were raised. First, that she could have gotten lost in the city, boarded another tour bus, or decided to return to her family home in Portão. Over time, however, all were discarded.

Regarding the possibility of kidnapping, the lack of a ransom demand discourages the hypothesis, and there are no indications of any other crime.

Nine years have passed and no one knows where Mrs. Beatriz might have went. If she’s still alive she’s 86 years old. Her son travelled around the country to see elderly women in hospitals and homes but none of them turned out to be his mother. Human bones found in the region sometime later were also ruled out.

Her family is still looking for answers and her son believes she’s still alive. This is a website dedicated to finding Mrs. Beatriz: [http://www.ondeestadonabeatriz.com.br/](http://www.ondeestadonabeatriz.com.br/)

For a group of his friends and a former mayor of the city where the crime occurred, it was a “Mission Accomplished” moment. Outside of the collapse of the Champlain Towers South in June, the Goldman kidnapping in 1966 was the biggest story to hit sleepy Surfside. Most South Floridians likely have no idea who Goldman was or his horrible end. 

But one local attorney and a group of five Miami Beach High grads who knew Goldman from school and the neighborhood could not forget about the case that shook up their the years of their youth. They became volunteer sleuths and worked the case for 10 years, uncovering a Mafia connection and much more. Impressive work. And homicide detectives agreed. In a video clip, Miami-Dade Det. Jonathan Grossman of the cold-case unit said that, while working the case, they contacted the lead volunteer sleuth, attorney Paul Novack, a former Surfside mayor, and the “volunteer investigation team,” as Novack calls them. They “provided critical information” that helped identify a man named George Defeis as Goldman’s kidnapper. Defeis is long dead. A partial fingerprint, a handicapped gait to his walk and the taxi he took to the crime scene all helped build a case against Defeis years later, Goodman explained in the video. And the group of friends — Novack, along with Anthony Blate, David and Joe Graubart and Harvey Lisker — unearthed a startling revelation.

 According to the sleuth team, Goldman’s abduction was a retaliation murder, a Mafia hit, made to look like a kidnapping. It had nothing to do with ransom money and everything to do with Goldman’s father testifying days before the kidnapping in front of a federal grand jury in Miami about fraud at a bank where the elder Goldman was on the board of directors. The Miami Debate Novack said some involved with the fraud at the bank had ties to Meyer Lansky, Santo Trafficante Jr., Joe Cacciatore and Jimmy Hoffa, all who had connections to South Florida at the time. Defeis was linked to the Trafficante organization, the volunteer sleuths determined by poring through documents, interviewing relatives and friends and chasing leads that detectives back then had ignored. “We uncovered an enormous amount of hidden information. This case has tentacles like you would not believe,” Novack told the Editorial Board. Among the findings is that corrupt sheriffs, with links to organized crime, may have “lost” evidence in the case. 

So why the interest in the kidnapping of Danny Goldman? Novack says he was 8 years old and also living in Surfside when Danny was kidnapped. “The crime affected the entire community. No one locked their doors before this happened,” he said. That changed because the Goldman kidnapper entered the home at 4:30 a.m. through an unlocked sliding glass door. He tied up Aaron and Sally Goldman, dragged Danny out and told the parents he wanted $50,000 and would be calling them later in the day. No call ever came. Danny’s body was never found, but the theory is that his body was dismembered and dumped in the ocean. No arrests were made. Both Goldman parents have since died. Novack and the volunteer sleuths kept the case alive and shared their findings to cold-case detectives. This was a gratifying team effort. Volunteer sleuths were tenacious, and cold-case detectives listened. The result is some justice for Danny Goldman.

48,PrimeVector19,[],1642464961,"On November 17, 2003, at 6:30 pm, Matthew Colter was seen for the last time before he disappeared. 

The last person to see Colter alive was his sister, who had said he was acting oddly at the time - which is a telling sign being that Colter was schizophrenic. Yet, the circumstances surrounding his disappearance may rival his behavior at the time he vanished. 

Colter’s last known whereabouts begin and end at his residence in the 1100 block of Erika Road in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

Colter’s sister went to his home the following day, and she saw some… uncanny things, to say the least. 

Colter’s door was unlocked; there were pry marks on the door, some appliances were damaged, and someone had even defecated on the floor. There was no sign of Colter at the scene, and he has not been heard from. 

There were some reported sightings of Colter in the days subsequent to his disappearance, but none of the accounts were verified. Foul play is suspected. 

Could Colter have been lured out of his home? Could be have disappeared by his own volition? Was the unsettling scenery at his home a foreboding sign? 

It seems to me that this case - like many - has been thoroughly disregarded by authorities, and it has not gained much attention. 

Matthew Colter is a black male who was 46 years old at the time of his disappearance. He is 6’0, 160 pounds. He wears glasses. Colter suffers from schizophrenia, and needs medication - which he did not have with him when he disappeared. He may be a danger to himself.

[Lauren Spierer](https://uncovered.com/cases/lauren-spierer) was a junior at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, studying apparel merchandising in 2011. A native of Scarsdale, New York, Lauren had a tight group of friends on and off campus. That makes her now-10-year disappearance even more baffling.

Lauren's case has received a lot of media attention since she went missing, including national coverage from the likes of Nancy Grace and People Magazine. But there are still so many unresolved questions from that night, including the biggest—*where is Lauren?* 

**The day Lauren went missing.** On the late evening of June 2nd, 2011, [Lauren was seen leaving her apartment](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled) with a friend, David Rohn. The two went to another mutual friend’s apartment, Jay Rosenbaum. Lauren, David and Jay had plans to meet up with Jay’s neighbor, Corey Rossman. There were approximately 10 people at Corey’s apartment with [reports of heavy drinking and drug use.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/lauren-spierer-case-years-vanished-hope/story?id=40084230) By midnight, David heads back to his apartment at Smallwoods Plaza and per surveillance footage, he isn’t seen leaving the apartment again around 11AM the next morning. 

[By 1:46AM, Lauren goes to Kilroy Sports Bar](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled) and is later seen leaving the bar with Corey Rossman by 2:27AM. Lauren leaves behind her shoes at the bar because the bar has a sand- covered patio. After leaving the bar, there is a lot of back and forth from various friends homes before she is last seen: 

* By 2:30AM Lauren and Corey are seen at Smallwood Plaza but are confronted by Zach Oates, and 3 others who are concerned about Lauren. [Zach Oates and Corey have a verbal altercation before Zach punches Corey in the face. ](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled)

* When they return back to Smallwood Plaza, at Corey’s apartment where his room tries to convince Lauren to sleep over instead of walking back to her apartment, she refuses. 
* Lauren then heads over to Jay’s apartment next door by 4:15AM, where she borrows Jay’s phone to call David and another unidentified friend, but neither of them pick up the phone. By 4:30AM on June 3, 2011, Jay says he last saw Lauren at the intersection of 11th Street and College Ave, headed south on College Ave.; barefoot, wearing black leggings and a white shirt she was last seen barefoot, wearing black leggings and a white shirt.

**When she was reported missing.** By the afternoon of June 3, Lauren’s boyfriend tries to get in contact with her, but is contacted by an employee of Kilroy’s Sports Bar to let him know that Lauren left her phone there. Lauren’s roommate meets up with her boyfriend to try to find Lauren. Her friends called to report her missing to the Bloomington Police Department shortly after that. Lauren’s sister, Rebecca calls around to family to let them know that Lauren has been reported missing. Lauen’s mother, Charlene, starts calling local hospitals while her father, Robert, calls her boyfriend, [who is at the police station. Lauren’s parents arrive in Bloomington the very next day.](https://uncovered.com/cases/lauren-spierer) 

Three days later, the community gathered to search for Lauren throughout the Bloomington area including Smallwood Plaza—where she was last seen. Two days later, police reveal that there are 10 people of interest. Volunteers continue to coordinate search efforts but there is no sign of Lauren. 

**Where the case stands today.** Lauren’s family is still searching for her. Shortly after she went missing, Lauren was featured in a segment of “America’s Most Wanted” which brought in 350 tips but unfortunately no breakthroughs in the case. [National pleas from celebrities](https://nypost.com/2011/06/08/star-search-3/) such as Denise Richards and Donnie Wahlberg were made for anyone with information to come forward. Last year, a TikTok surfaced to say they had information on her disappearance. While nothing credible was found, Lauren’s mom shared that she forwards all leads to authorities in hopes that one will lead to answers.

WIth so much construction in a college town, the area where Lauren disappeared is almost unrecognizable from 10 years ago. Did you attend Indiana University in 2011? Did you see someone matching her description the early morning of June 3 at the corner of 11th Street and College Ave?

50,jordenjorden11,[],1642444307,"Simon de Vries is a 21-year old Dutch student. By all accounts, Simon comes from a normal family, was not known to be depressed and had never run away from home. He was studying a degree in Industrial Product Design in The Hague, Netherlands. Although he had mentioned that he wanted to stop his studies, a month before his disappearance, he had still paid the tuition for the coming school year.

Saturday, October 3, 2020: Simon is spending his school holiday in his hometown Heerhugowaard, in the north of the country. He finished working his shift at Action, a discount store. He then ate dinner at home. In the evening, he left home with a cooler of beer, to meet with friends for a drink. According to his parents, he was in a cheerful mood. Because of corona restrictions, the group of friends decides to split up into two groups instead of meeting altogether, and therefore no one notices that Simon is actually never seen that evening. One group thinks he is with the other group and vice versa.

His parents only find out the next morning on Sunday that he is not at home. He hasn't sent a message and his bike isn't there either. Normally Simon would always be communicative. His father is worried, but can't get hold of Simon. His friends don't know where he is either. Via an old phone from Simon, his father finds out that his son checked in on Saturday evening at Hotel Bastion in Maastricht. That would be a very long 3-4 hour journey from his hometown, with no direct train, and Simon had no reason to go there. The father calls the police and decides to travel there himself.

Police did indeed locate Simon at the hotel. They speak with him for a long time, but do not notice anything suspicious. Simon claimed he just wanted a weekend away. When his father arrives some time later, Simon tells him the same. His father tries to persuade him to go home, but Simon wants to relax and promises to be home the following Wednesday. When asked why he chose to go to Maastricht, Simon said that was the furthest place he is allowed go during corona restrictions (Maastricht is at the far south of the country). He also says he will keep his mother informed. But he would never keep either promise. After Simon left the hotel around noon the next day, all traces are missing.

After a few days, Simon is no longer heard from, his father decides to call in the police again. But because Simon is an adult and the police previously spoke to him in good health just before that, no action is taken.

After two weeks, the police conduct an investigation which shows that Simon has no longer withdrawn any money from his bank account and also does not have a passport with him. To the frustration of the family, Dutch authorities does not give permission to trace his phone. He no longer uses his phone, but the device can be traced via the IMEI number. But tracing is not allowed, because there is no indication of a crime committed. It also becomes clear that Simon has not used his public transport student card. He doesn't have a car, but he does have a driver's license. His bicycle is also missing. Simon may have had at most 100 euros with him.

The police have added him to the register of missing persons, as an ""unexplained disappearance"".

The parents elaborated more about Simon's mental state. They said Simon was an active person, however due to the corona restrictions, he was spending more time indoors at his laptop. Simon's mother did remark that Simon had earlier asked ""can someone's location be tracked if they use their bank card?"". The parents have two scenarios in mind. First, Simon could have left for a warmer country. Second, Simon was not happy and his mother has ""doubt if he is still alive today"".

53,mintwolves,[],1642415699," Ike Ibeabuchi abducted his estranged girlfriend's 15-year-old son one night in 1997 and was driving along the Interstate 35 in Austin with him in the car when he decided to ram it into a concrete pillar in an attempt to both their lives. 

Ibeabuchi was only 24, an undefeated heavyweight boxer in the prime of his career, but who was slowly being consumed by his inner demons. As he was dragged away from the wreckage, covered in blood and dust, wide-eyed and delirious, he thought he had ended his nightmare.

It had only been a couple of months since he outgunned David Tua in an epic fight that still boasts the record for most punches thrown in a heavyweight contest (1,730). The win had catapulted him into contention for a world title fight.

The teenage boy in the passenger seat of Ibeabuchi's car suffered severe injuries and would never walk the same again. Ibeabuchi was sentenced to just 120 days in jail for false imprisonment and forced to pay $500,000 in a civil settlement.

Upon his release from prison Ibeabuchi returned to the ring the following year, picking up two easy knockout wins over Tim Ray and Everton Davis.

Then on March 20, 1999, Ibeabuchi truly announced himself into boxing's mainstream with a vicious knockout victory over Olympic silver medallist Chris Byrd.

Now 20-0 it seemed inevitable that would go one to fight for the heavyweight title but this would never happen.

Ibeabuchi's mental health was deteriorating 'President' persona was getting out of hand. At times when he was being churlish or refusing to complete a simple requirement such as attending a weigh-in, his handlers would appeal to 'The President's' regal nature by convincing him it was the noble thing to do. ""There were times when he thought he was really a president"", boxing promoter and former [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO) Sports executive Lou DiBella said. ""He would get into these mental states where he insisted on people calling him 'The President'. It was his alter ego, where 'I am The President,' not of the United States, but President of the world.""

Once, Ibeabuchi wielded a knife during a dinner meeting in New York to discuss a possible three fight HBO deal. ""We were having a fine meal at a nice restaurant"", Promoter Cedric Kushner said, ""and mid-course Ike picked up a big carving knife, slammed it into the table and screamed 'They knew it! They knew it! The belts belong to me! Why don't they just give them back?'"" ""That was a peculiar experience"", Kushner said. ""That wasn't the type of conduct I expected to romance the guy from HBO. He (Ibeabuchi) was like a Viking.""

In July 1999, Ibeabuchi was staying at The Mirage Hotel and Casinoi in Vegas when he phoned a local escort service and had a woman sent to his room. The 21-year-old woman said later she was there to strip and nothing else. She claimed Ibeabuchi attacked her after she demanded to be paid up front. Ibeabuchi barricaded himself in the bathroom and police discharged pepper spray under the door until he surrendered.

Ibeabuchi's legal defense faced the further difficulty of the Clark County DA's reopening of a similar sexual assault allegation against him from eight months earlier which took place at another hotel. Ibeabuchi was released on bail and placed under house arrest, able to train and fight again until his trial. He was remanded after two more similar allegations surfaced from Arizona.

Ibeabuchi was deemed incompetent to stand trial and was sent to a state facility. Medical experts concluded he exhibited bipolar disorder and a judge granted permission to force-medicate him. Eight months later, TWO AND A HALF YEARS after his arrest, he was ruled cogent enough to plea.

Ibeabuchi subsequently entered an Alford Plea, pleading guilty while not admitting guilt to avoid going to trial. Ibeabuchi was sentenced to two to ten years for battery with intent to commit a crime (from which he was later paroled), and three to 20 years for attempted Sexual Assault, with the sentences to be served consecutively.

While incarcerated, Ibeabuchi earned three college associate degrees in General Studies, Business, and Management. He also earned a paralegal certificate by correspondence from Blackstone Career Institute in Allentown, Pennsylvania. His Las Vegas conviction was overturned by the Nevada Supreme Court in 2007 and he was expected to be released, but the lower courts abandoned the ruling. The Nevada Supreme Court subsequently affirmed its earlier ruling of its overturning of Ibeabuchi's Las Vegas conviction again, and Ibeabuchi's Nevada conviction was eventually overturned, vacated (cleared as innocent) and discharged.

THE RELEASE &amp; PLANNED COMEBACK

Ibeabuchi completed his sentence in the Nevada Department of Corrections. Prior to this, Ibeabuchi was moved to the Washoe County Jail on February 28, 2014, and then he was transferred by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Eloy Detention Centre in Eloy, Arizona.

Ibeabuchi was released by USCIS in November 2015 as a free man when Nigeria declined to provide travel documents. Ibeabuchi enlisted the help of Mike Koncz, an adviser of Manny Pacquiao, in an attempt to make a boxing comeback. In good health, Ibeabuchi hoped to fight his first comeback bout in the near future, but he was waiting to resolve his immigration and United States citizenship status with USCIS first. He holds a green card and his citizenship was pending only the formal swearing in. However, in April 2016, Ibeabuchi was arrested for violating the conditions of his probation in Gilbert, Arizona, based on an old warrant dating back to 2003 that he claimed to be unaware of.

Ibeabuchi was released on September 23, 2020, from the Arizona State penal system after serving required time, and his probationary status was overturned on appeal. He was thought to be being held at the United States Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) in Eloy, Arizona, during the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus period until his swearing in ceremony and the formal awarding of U.S. citizenship can be scheduled, either while in detainee custody or after final release.

but....

WHERE IS IKE IBEABUCHI NOW ?

Here is some info from Luke G. Williams (the author of 'The President Of Pandemonium' the biography on Ike Ibeabuchi) 

"" Rumours that former heavyweight contender Ike Ibeabuchi had been released from prison first surfaced in Feb 2014. Actually he had been transferred to ICE custody .

After appearing before an immigration judge, an order was made to deport Ibeabuchi back to Nigeria. But his homeland refused to issue travel documents for his return.

With Nigeria unwilling to take him back, in November 2015 Ibeabuchi was freed from ICE and returned to everyday life in Arizona.

While a free man again, Ibeabuchi began training for a comeback fight. With Michael Koncz as his advisor, a possible showdown was even mooted with Andy Ruiz Jr, then a 25-0 contender on the Pacquiao vs Bradley undercard. Ike was in pretty good physical shape too.

In Feb 2016 I spoke to Ike Ibeabuchi by telephone and corresponded via email. He was excited about his comeback and told me: “I have unfinished business in boxing. I have to redeem myself. I want to be a world champion before day turns to dusk.""

However as part of ‘Operation Justice’ in Arizona, Ibeabuchi was re-arrested on 7 April 2016 for failing the terms of his probation. A further 3 1/2 year sentence was imposed, with 505 days of time served applied.

On 23 September 2020 Ibeabuchi was released from prison but once again returned to ICE custody at Eloy, Arizona (pictured). When my book was completed Ike’s future was unclear. So what has happened in the months since ?

First of all ICE’s Eloy facility had serious Covid issues, It seems Ike just had to stay put for a while.

Then, sometime between April and 11 August 2021, Ibeabuchi’s name no longer appeared in the ICE detainee locator database. What this meant was either a: he had DIED b: he had been released back into the USA or c: he had been deported to Nigeria. ICE wouldn’t say what happened…

Until last week ( posted 29th October 2021) Ike Ibeabuchi’s whereabouts were unclear. But I now understand that he was indeed deported back to Nigeria and at one point was being held and his case processed in the Nigeria Immigration Service in Abuja.

**Questions Remain**. Is Ibeabuchi still in Nigerian immigration custody or is he finally free again? ""

If Ike is free surely he would have made contact with his advisor, management or boxing media like he did on his 2014 release? and how can one man be detained for such a long time after his sentence has been served? At 49 years old is Ike's career in boxing finally over ?

54,PrincessNutNut,[],1642407959,"Shannan Gilbert’s grave in Amityville cemetery lies eight miles from where she went missing in May 2011 after visiting a client at Oak Beach, a spit of sand dotted with holiday homes on New York’s Long Island, three miles short of Gilgo Beach, where her remains were found eight months later.

Gilbert’s final resting place, with a simple headstone at the back of the cemetery inscribed with her dates – 24 October 1986 – 13 December 2011 – speaks to an enduring mystery of how she, along with 10 or more other women, mostly sex workers who advertised on Craigslist, ended up dead along the same stretch of scrubby barrier marshes more than a decade ago.

13 December is not the date Gilbert went missing. A year and seven months earlier – 1 May 2010 – she’d made a frantic 22-minute call to 911 from the area and reportedly said: “They are trying to kill me.” She knocked on two neighbor’s doors, before disappearing back into the night. Three other 911 calls were made that night. One call was from Gilbert’s client Joseph Brewer and two were from the neighbors.

During the search for Gilbert, police found four more sets of remains later identified as Melissa Barthelemy, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello. The Gilgo Four, as they became known, had been discarded in a similar fashion, 500ft apart, each swathed or covered in burlap sack cloth.

Six more bodies were found in the same area at about the same time. Their dates of death, too, speak to the uncertainty that pervades the case of the Long Island serial killer. Police initially said they believed Gilbert drowned by accident, which few believed, and a medical examiner’s autopsy proved inconclusive.

In the 11 years since, Gilgo Beach has become synonymous with violent death and law enforcement failures rooted in incompetence or, worse, institutional disregard. But now, it seems, concrete steps are finally being taken to try to solve the mystery once more.

Last week Rodney Harrison, the new police commissioner of Suffolk county, inherited the case – which has become one of the most notorious unsolved crimes in the US. It goes back to 1996, when body parts of the earliest-known victims were found on the shores of Fire Island, a holiday destination.

It was Harrison who said he would release Gilbert’s 911 call “as long as it doesn’t impede the investigation”. Last week, Harrison went further, saying a ring of people could be possibly connected to the murders. “I’m feeling confident that we’re getting closer to making an arrest,” he told a [local news outlet.](https://pix11.com/news/local-news/long-island/new-suffolk-police-commissioner-plans-on-solving-gilgo-and-inspiring-black-recruits-who-look-like-me/)

If that’s correct, it will have taken Harrison about two weeks to move a case forwards that hadn’t advanced much in 11 years. And that raises several questions, not least why would it require a police commissioner from New York City to get things going.

Among the theories that have circulated was that police did not call in the FBI because they had elements of their own to hide. But Harrison said that linking the Gilgo murder investigation to local police misconduct was a disservice to the investigation. “I can reassure everybody that there’s no coverup in this case,” he said.

According to the Suffolk district attorney, Ray Tierney, who worked with Harrison in Brooklyn, the case is now a firm priority. Tierney has called in FBI investigators as well as running a team of detectives of his own.

“I go into it with no expectations, but there is a voluminous amount of evidence that’s been collected. We’re going to review and go where it leads us,” Tierney told the Guardian. “It matters to the victims’ families and the people of Suffolk county. They want to see it solved.”

But Gilgo Beach residents last week professed a striking level of indifference. “Bad things happen all over, but some make the headlines. Other than gosh, who’d have thought that would happen here, all the talk seems to be coming from people who don’t come from here,” noted one man parked in a pick-up.

The sense that the case has gone cold, and of official indifference over the last 11 years, vexes John Ray, the Gilbert family’s lawyer. Ray has been a consistent advocate for the family’s efforts to find justice for Gilbert, along with the other women who were found along the coastline. 

“Police incompetence, along with certain willful conduct by members of the police department, was a bad mix that destroyed the ability to solve this case,” Ray told the Guardian.

Ray has pursued, through civil litigation and by applying pressure to investigators, a local resident of Oak Beach whom he believes is a prime suspect in Gilbert’s murder and those of the other women found along the beach. The man, a former senior official in the local emergency medical services, made several calls to Gilbert’s mother in the days following Gilbert’s disappearance as well as calls to regional police, her boyfriend, her driver and the client “to learn what he could about Shannan”, Ray has alleged in a civil suit.

Police said initially said Gilbert had probably died accidentally in the marsh behind the man’s house, but that was before they had a body. Later they said she was calm on the 911 call. While Ray is bound by the court to not discuss what he heard on the call, he allows that what police reported “appears to be a deliberate misrepresentation of what happened”.

“It starts to give you pause about what the police’s view of all this was,” he added.

The man later denied his involvement in Gilbert’s disappearance and denied he’d made the calls. “So he did all of these things to try to get serious information. He had no reason to do that if he wasn’t involved,” Ray said.

But other suspects are also in the frame, according to Ray. In essence, murder on this scale takes place in a context of local corruption, Ray said, and that context is what police have been unwilling or unable to expose.

“All of that adds to the problem of defining the circle of guilt. The corruption involved sex and drugs, and these people are involved in either or both of those behaviors. That’s what unites them, but it’s also what makes it so difficult to pin the culprit down because there are so many people with different liabilities.”

Phil Boyle, state senator for Long Island’s fourth district, has asked the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, for an outside investigation of the investigation, believing that figures in the local police force hampered the inquiry and prevented investigators, including the FBI, from looking at cellphone records. “Nobody in their right mind would remove the FBI from a serial killer investigation.”

Where this may lead it is too soon to know.

Melissa Cann, sister of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, told the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/01/10/new-leads-could-finally-solve-gruesome-gilgo-beach-murders/) on Monday she felt hopeful. Lorraine Ela, mother of Megan Waterman, said she had been “kind of skeptical” prior to Harrison’s press conference, but that she now felt the police chief would “work this case with dignity”.

“I am tired of hearing the same crap come out of everyone’s mouth,” she told the outlet via email. “\[But\] I was very pleased with the words from Mr Harrison. He seems to care for the victims.”

Many people involved, on a deep personal level or on a professional level that has become deeply personal, anticipate that a new police chief and district attorney from outside the region, together with FBI, can bring some hope for a resolution to a series of profoundly bleak crimes.

John Ray believes that ultimately the police will identity a suspect and bring charges. But, he cautions, regardless of a conviction, “nobody will believe they are the only killer. The police bungled this case so badly and for so many years, we’ve got a Jack the Ripper situation. It will never be solved even if it is.”

55,justacupofchai,[],1642390699,"**Background**

She was between 5'1 and 5'3, of Afro-Caribbean descent. She was dressed smartly and wore distinctive jewelry. In her possession were a handful of items - including an oil painting and a bus pass - yet she has remained unidentified for more than seventeen years.

On Friday, October 29th, 2004, a woman was seen to jump from a rooftop restaurant in the North London area. By the time help arrived, it was too late and she was declared dead.

Police assumed that her identity would be shortly discovered. She jumped from Wembley Point, a building hosting many offices at the time. Perhaps she was one such office worker.

She also had numerous items with her, including:

1. £5.20 in cash
2. a Guardian newspaper for that day
3. a black disposable lighter and a used packet of 10 Marlborough cigarettes 
4. a black carrier bag with clear lettering CPNY
5. a bus pass valid from Oct. 26 to Nov. 1, issued at Seven Sisters Road station, Tottenham, London at 7:07 am
6. an oil painting of, ironically, a woman looking at a faceless figure

**The Carrier Bag**

Police eventually identified the lettering on the bag to have stood for Central Park New York. They explored the possibility that Wembley Point Woman may have been a tourist from America, but this line of questioning never produced any solid leads. Investigators now believe it's more likely she was from the local area, and even more specifically from the Tottenham (North London) area close to where she bought her bus pass.

Side note: sources seemed fairly confident that CPNY stood for Central Park New York. I'm not sure if other options have been conclusively ruled out though.

**The Bus Pass**

According to investigators, it is very likely that Wembley Point Woman was from the area where she purchased the bus pass and may have even been a frequent commuter on that particular bus route. We also know that she bought the ticket early in the morning; that factor, along with the fact that she was smartly dressed, may suggest she had a professional office-type job. 

In my opinion, that just makes the case even more puzzling because she seems as if she might have had a routine, and therefore, people to notice if she strayed from her routine. One factor that might go against the ""routine"" theory is that Wembley Point Woman bought a weekly bus pass, which seems  strangely short-term to me if she was a regular commuter.

**The Oil Painting**

This seems to be the most baffling of the things carried by the Wembley Point Woman: an oil painting measuring 2ft x 1ft, that is so unique that I wonder how we have gone seventeen years (!) without someone recognizing it. There is yet no consensus on what the painting represents or who might have painted it. It's very possible that it could be a work of art by Wembley Point Woman herself.

I'm no art expert, but the painting seems influenced by Afro-Caribbean culture, which is why I think it might have held some special meaning for Wembley Point Woman. This is total speculation on my part, but the painting seems to focus on themes around identity. If that's true, it definitely is quite a cruel and ironic situation that the owner of the piece remains unidentified to this day.

**Current Investigation**

In partnership with law enforcement, this case is now being examined by Locate International, a community interest company of investigators, specialists, and volunteers. With advancements in technology, especially with the reach of social media, there is renewed hope that soon Wembley Point Woman will be identified and remembered by her proper name as she should be.

56,woolfonmynoggin,[],1642371542,"Shelby Wright was born in 1990 and was 14 in 2004. He lived with his mother, Lisa Wright, and her parents, Dennis and Yvonne Wright, in Snohomish, Washington; his father was not in his life. He was very good with electronics and was known to buy old computers to dissect for parts. He was able to rig cameras and computers together from parts by the time he was 10. He had a lot of interests, including cats and rare diseases like Mad Cow Disease (krefeld jacobs disease in humans). He seemed to be an animal lover and loved to write, even making his own newsletter for family and friends. 

In the summer of 2004, Shelby spent most of the summer at his uncle's house, helping to care for his great grandmother who was suffering from dementia and going to summer school. He found caring for his great grandmother too much and came home to his mother at the end of July. His grandparents that also lived in the house were out of town. Shelby seemed pretty independent, allowed to roam and get himself to summer school and friends' houses on his scooter. 

On July 26th, 2004, the girlfriend of Rob Wolf rode on her bike to the family home because she was worried about Shelby's whereabouts. Rob Wolf was a very close family friend that was fatherly toward Shelby. He is also described as a ""drug user"" by police and took Shelby to sweep parking lots. This visit sparked an anxious search that went from Snohomish to Machias and uncovered Shelby's scooter on Wolf's property. The last time anyone had contact with Shelby was July 27th when a police officer gave him a ride home and his mother later saw him on his scooter. There is some discrepancy between whether it was the 26th or the 27th the last time someone saw him between the newer news articles and the older ones. The only thing missing was his laptop after his scooter was found at Rob Wolf's house. 

At first, his disappearance was treated like a runaway case but there was no sign of Shelby for years and police began to lean more towards foul play. Searches were conducted on the properties of Shelby's uncle who he had been staying with and Rob Wolf. Nothing turned up. After Wolf's death, further searches were conducted of his former property, this time more thorough as the property was now less cluttered, and still there was no sign of Shelby. This leads us to today; it seems like nothing much has happened in the years since the searches were conducted. Yvonne Wright still looks out her window hoping to see Shelby walking up the driveway but she knows that it isn't likely. His family have all come to believe that he is deceased and was a victim of foul play but questions obviously still remain. What happened to Shelby? 

Police have hinted that they believe Rob Wolf had something to do with Shelby's disappearance but he  and his girlfriend died not that many years after the disappearance and there simply isn't a lot to go on. Their property was littered with rusted out cars when the first search was conducted but they were gone before the second. Was there any evidence in these cars that was lost? Why did Rob's girlfriend ride her bike along a highway to look for Shelby? Shelby's uncle is also a possibility but it is unclear if that was a real suspicion or more perfunctory clearing all men in the boy's life. A stranger or a grooming abduction is also possible but much more unlikely, though without the laptop to search it is impossible to rule out an internet grooming situation. Was there an accident or death by misadventure? Did he actually run away? Again, these are both unlikely but not impossible. Unfortunately, unless someone comes forward or the remains are found, we won't know what happened to Shelby. I believe his mother and grandparents are all still alive as I was unable to find any obits for them. If you have any information on the disappearance of Shelby Wright, call the sheriff’s tip line at 425-388-3845 or Crime Stoppers of Puget Sound at 800-222-8477.

CAMBRIA COUNTY, Pa. (WTAJ) – On the afternoon of Jan. 6, 1996 Forest Hills Ambulance was dispatched to a home in Summerhill, Cambria County where a woman was found dead in her bedroom.

Beth Ann Bodenschatz was discovered with a gunshot wound to her head. 25 years later, her son who was five at the time remains the only witness to the crime.

At the time of the murder, Bodenschatz’s son recalled hearing his mother yelling and seeing a man with a gun shoot her. The shooter was described as having brown hair and wore a brown jacket.

Several other witnesses observed a brown/beige Subaru car parked at the end of Bodenschatz’s driveway where a male had been seen walking from the residence to the vehicle.

The murder weapon has never been found and Ebensburg State Police continue their investigation of the homicide.

I have thought about this case for the last 25 years. I was a junior in high school when this happened. It was a few towns over from where I lived, however in Central Pennsylvania the small towns are very close knit. 


It was heartbreaking when the billboard was put up (in the links), just to think that an innocent 5 year old saw his mother gunned down is almost too much to wrap your head around. 


There were rumors back in the day that it was a murder for hire, but the hit man got the wrong house as it was supposedly intended for a neighbors wife. Again, with small town PA also comes big time rumors. I have no idea if there is any truth to that theory. 


What I do know is that the PA State Police are no closer to solving this cold case then they were in 1996.


I moved out of PA a long time ago, but I never forgot this case. I would absolutely love for a podcast to be made about it to bring it back into the light. Someone knows what happened and someone got away with a horrific murder that day. Let's get the word out.

58,daniel-rago,[],1642334498,"On January 22, 1993, two seventeen-year-old girls came to Zakopane: Ernestyna Wieruszewska, born on May 14, 1975, permanently residing in Legionowo near Warsaw, and Anna Semczuk, born on February 4, 1975, from the capital district of Praga-Północ. 

The girls were not friends from elementary school, they started to be friends only in September 1992, and they considered the winter break a great opportunity to strengthen their friendship. They both loved hiking in the mountains, so there could be only one goal of their escapade. From January 22, the girls stayed in a private room in Kościelisko, a town adjacent to Zakopane, Poland.

The room was chosen by Wieruszewska, who had already lived there on one of the oasis trips and was clearly satisfied with the hospitality she received there. Over the weekend, the teens hiked in the mountains. The pace of the trips must have been quite strenuous, because in a postcard that Anna sent to her family home, she wrote: ""I'm staggering, but God is my witness, this is what I dreamed about."" According to the findings of the subsequent investigation, the girls visited, among others, Gubałówka, Mroźna Cave, Czarny Staw, Kościeliska Valley, Ornak and Jaworzynka. This is due to the testimony of witnesses, including the landlady of the accommodation, which is also confirmed by entries in the diary kept by Anna.

On Tuesday, January 26, 1993, the two girls woke up around 9 am. They paid the owner of the accommodation for the stay so far, told her that they had made an appointment with their friends at the Zakopane train station, and that they also intended to buy a return ticket to the capital. The woman advised them not to go hiking in the mountains, the day was extremely frosty and snowy.

When the clocks showed 7pm, the landlady began to worry about the prolonged absence of the Warsaw students. 

It was a new day, Wednesday, January 27, 1993. The landlady was surprised and anxious to say that the girls had not returned to their accommodation for the night. She decided to notify the District Police Headquarters in Zakopane and the parents of both seventeen-year-old girls. On Thursday, January 28, 1993, the parents of the missing girls appeared in Kościelisko, who officially reported the missing girls to the Police and TOPR. As it was found unofficially, when the girls' parents appeared in their room, it was cold, as if the heating had been turned off many hours ago.

The first activity carried out by the officers of the Zakopane KRP was the inspection of the rented accommodation. It turned out that the teenager's documents were left on the spot, including passports, warm clothes, a camera, money... 

The Zakopane Police have adopted several hypothetical versions of the events: In the first one it was suspected that, despite the warnings of the hostess, the girls went on a trip to the mountains, during which they had an accident. This version was also considered probable by the hostess and her son, pointing out that in the previous days the girls wandered in the mountains despite clearly unfavorable conditions. The police considered this version unlikely, because all the warm clothes were left in the room, and thus the girls were dressed too lightly for such an expedition. Moreover, the period of time between the girls waking up and the possible departure from the room is only about 20 minutes, which justifies the assumption that they would not have had time to prepare sandwiches or even tea necessary for such an escapade. 

Another version that was considered was homicide. It was supposed that the landlady's son, who was supposed to have had a conflict with Ernestyna during her previous stay and allegedly threatened her, could have done it. This hypothesis was reinforced by the fact that hardly anyone had been established who would confirm with certainty the meeting with the girls after they left their room. The entire property was searched, but no trace of this version of events was found. However, it should be assumed that if the landlady's son had actually made any threats against the girl, she would rather not have chosen this place as her room. 

Another hypothesis emerged, namely that both girls could have been kidnapped to work in an escort agency in Western Europe. Apparently, in the winter of 1993, the Slovak police broke up a gang engaged in this type of activity. Police reached two witnesses. The first of them was supposed to see two young girls getting into a car with foreign registration numbers at the PKS bus stop in Kościelisko on January 26. It can be assumed with a certain degree of probability that they were Ernestyna and Anna. Another witness claimed that at the beginning of March 1993 he witnessed a conversation between two men, during which one of them told about the kidnapping of two young girls in Zakopane. Finally, another argument in favor of this hypothesis is that on March 4, 1993 there was a break-in in Anna's stepfather's car. There would be nothing special about it, if not for the fact that nothing of value was stolen from the car except... a passport and a high school girl's diary. 

Intensive operational activities were carried out, but they did not bring any results. The family asked for help from clairvoyants. Their ""visions"", however, were very contradictory. One of the clairvoyants stated that both girls were dead - one of them due to a skull injury, the other died of fear. Another clairvoyant claimed that high school students went on the trail with the boys they were supposed to meet at the Zakopane train station and were thrown into the abyss during the trip. Another claimed that both girls were alive: Ernestyna is still a resident of Zakopane, and Anna lives north of Warsaw. 

At the beginning of November 1994, the prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office in Zakopane appeared in Warsaw, who received notifications of suspected crime from the parents of high school students. By the decision of November 18, 1994, an investigation was initiated into the deprivation of liberty of both teenagers.

The collected evidence was analyzed, requests for help were sent to Interpol, and witnesses were interrogated. The version of the mishap has been ruled out as unlikely on the grounds that it seems impossible to have a simultaneous accident of two healthy people without leaving any trace. The kidnapping of high school girls and taking them abroad was considered the most likely version. On October 28, 1996, the investigation was suspended due to the lack of premises for its continuation.  The presumption of the disappearance of Ernestyna and Anna will be statute-barred on January 26, 2023.

60,wyldcynic,[],1642266264,"I’ve become consumed with the Ellen Greenberg case and I’m wondering what theories others may have about her death? I feel there’s really strong evidence against her fiancé. I don’t suspect anyone else and suicide seems ridiculous to me. I’m not sure if it was premeditated but I’m leaning towards no. There are an abundance of red flags in my opinion…here are a few that particularly bother me. 

1- The fiancé’s 911 call. I don’t buy it. Yeah everyone reacts differently and you can’t judge someone in the moment, I get that. BUT. How did he not see a knife protruding from her chest through her clothing? I can’t imagine that would not be clearly evident from the moment he saw her body even from across the room. However, he didn’t notice the knife until he was asked to do CPR, until after he was asked to look directly at her chest to see if she was breathing? And then his first reaction is “Oh, she stabbed herself!” and not something more like “OMG she’s been stabbed?” He’s already putting the suggestion out there that she stabbed herself. That’s the very first assumption he has?

2- The fiancé’s texts to her while he’s locked out. They are increasing ANGRY and even threatening by the end (“you better have an excuse” and “u have no idea”). This really underscores, in addition to multiple bruises at various stages of healing that were found on her body, a potentially abusive personality. If all was fine and well when he left, why would he be so pissed off as opposed to concerned for her welfare? Then of course there’s the obvious question of why he didn’t try to call her rather than just sending texts that she may not hear. And why he took 20 minutes to stand there and text while fuming before going to apartment security for assistance. 

3- Why did he lie and say the security guy was with him when he busted down the door? Unless he wanted a witness upon finding her to lessen the suspicion towards him as the perp. The security guy claims he never accompanied him, never went into the apt, never went up to the 6th floor. No reason for lies unless you are hiding something. 

I’m pretty convinced her fiancé did it but I wonder what theories folks may have about the way it played out?

I believe Ellen’s recently increasing anxiety was the result of her questioning whether the marriage was a good idea, perhaps because the closer they got to the wedding, the more comfortable he became with showing abusive tendencies. Hence the bruises on her body, and her vagueness about the reasons for her mental health issues that she was seeking help for. Domestic abuse victims are often ashamed and don’t even tell their family. Perhaps she wasn’t sure she was “really” being abused and was embarrassed to admit it during the wedding planning. Perhaps she was gaslit and full of self doubt and a little scared. Yet the save the date cards were dropped in the mail, increasing the pressure and making it harder to back out. She spoke to her family about wanting to move home for a while. That’s unusual for a happy couple planning a wedding in just a few months. I think she was scared and knew she needed to get away from him to be safe but was too embarrassed to reveal she had been abused. 

I suspect they got into an argument that afternoon and she - or he - may have threatened to call off the wedding. But at that point my theory sort of splits. Either he was enraged and killed her, catching her off guard while she was making her fruit salad  with such a blitz attack she would not have had defensive wounds, then came up with the idea to rig the lock so it was easy to break down later, and jimmied the lock closed from outside on his way to the gym. At the gym he cleaned up and composed himself, then went back up to find he was “locked out.” In a panic, the only way he could think to make it look like he didn’t do it was to lock her inside where it would be “impossible” for anyone but her to have inflicted the wounds.

Alternately, they argued and he left. Either she told him to leave (angering him) or he stormed out on his own. She locked him out, possibly scared of him or what he may do. He shows back up and sends the increasingly angry texts as she ignores him, which infuriates him to the point of breaking down the door OR she eventually lets him in and goes back to making her salad at which point he’s so furious he attacks her from behind. Then rigs the lock, goes down to the gym, etc from that point. 

Sorry for the length but interested to hear others thoughts on how things played out. Thanks!

61,SteampunkJester,[],1642263865,"I'm looking for very particular types of unsolved crimes/mysteries where an individual or group:

- Commits a crime whose main purpose isn't murder (or, if a murder does take place, it isn't/perceivably isn't the main motivation for the crime being perpetrated)

- Gets away with said crime and disappears with either very little or no trace as to what happened to them.

62,prajitoruldinoz,[],1642253431,"On Feb. 27, 1993, Twin Peaks Sheriff’s Station deputies responded to a call for service at a residence for a shot man. 

The 35-year-old man was immediately rushed to San Bernardino Medical Center, but unfortunately was pronounced dead from the gunshot wound. 

According to an article published in 1993 by San Bernardino County Sun, that call was made by an unidentified woman who had called authorities to report she had shot her boyfriend after a dispute.

The man was later identified as 35-year-old Rick Hafty. He was a native of Alhambra and worked as a driver for S.E. Pipeline Construction out of Santa Fe Springs. Hafty was Dad to two daughters. 

Deputies have later arrested Diane Elizabeth Cook, then 41, for investigation of murder, according to the same article from the Sun, but for some reason, Cook was released soon after. Authorities have never disclosed details of the original investigation, so that reason is unknown.

Long story short, with all leads exhausted there was nothing more to be done, so the case went cold.

Fast forward to June 2021: investigators from the Sheriff’s Cold Case Homicide Team have re-examined the case and reopened the investigation. This effort lead to the arrest of the same person arrested 28 years earlier - Diane Elizabeth Cook, who is now 70-year-old.

Authorities have not mentioned what new evidence led to Cook's latest arrest.  

Diane Elizabeth Cook, a resident of Crestline, remains in custody at West Valley Detention Centre in Rancho Cucamonga, with bail set at $1 million.

64,Rustamchik228,[],1642246667,"During the years of the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995), 45 journalists were killed on the territory of Yugoslavia. The first victims of the armed conflict were employees of the USSR State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinnoy. 30 years ago, on September 1, 1991, their car was shot down near the village of Hrvatska Kostajnica on the Belgrade-Zagreb highway. Their bodies were never found, but in March 2017, despite their status as missing, President of Russia Vladimir Putin awarded them the Order of Courage posthumously. It was only in 2021 that the case got off the ground, but there are still more questions than answers.

On a formal level, the war on the territory of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia began only in the summer of 1991, after on June 25, following Slovenia, it declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). But the first conflicts between the Croatian authorities and local Serbs, of whom more than 600 thousand lived there, began in the summer of 1990. The language was the source of contention.

The fact is that the Croatian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which won the first multi-party elections in May 1990, led by Franjo Tudjman, immediately renamed the Serbo-Croatian language into Croatian, changed its grammar, and banned the use of Cyrillic on the territory of the republic. Any mention of events from the history of Serbia, as well as Serbian writers and poets, were excluded from the school curriculum.

In addition, public discrimination against Serbs began in Croatia. Thus, one of the leaders of the CDU, later President of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, said that the local Serbs own as much land as they can carry on the soles of their shoes. And Franjo Tudjman called the Independent State of Croatia created by Hitler, where more than a million Serbs were killed by local Ustashe fascists in 1941-1945, the result of *""thousand-year aspirations of the Croatian people.""*

Discrimination was also formal: all Serbs working in the power structures, primarily militsiyamen, were forced to sign a humiliating “letter of loyalty” (nothing like this was required from Croats and representatives of other nationalities). As a result, in May 1990, parallel power structures began to form in Serb-populated areas of Croatia. In early July 1990, the militsiya of the city of Knin, led by Milan Martic, refused to obey the Ministry of the Interior of Croatia, after which militsiya units in other areas where the majority were Serbs began to announce the same thing.

On August 17, 1990, special forces moved out of Zagreb into the recalcitrant areas. The military was ordered to remove all weapons from the rebellious militsiya stations. This was done only in the town of Benkovac. The response of the Serbs was the ""Log Revolution"" - the widespread construction of barricades on the territory of Serbian communities. Because of this, communication between the northern and southern parts of Croatia was effectively terminated. Later, this day in the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina was celebrated as a public holiday - the Day of the Uprising of the Serbian people.

In March 1991, the first armed clashes began between Serbian self-defense units and units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard, and the Armed Forces of Croatia. According to the laws of the SFRY, all of the above structures were illegal armed formations. Weapons and ammunition came to Croatia from abroad, mainly from Hungary. At the same time, the Yugoslav People's Army did not intervene in these clashes for a long time, only creating separate zones of demarcation between the conflicting parties in the hottest spots.

Even after the declaration of independence of Croatia, parts of the Yugoslav People's Army were in no hurry to oppose the separatist armed units, most likely due to the indecision of Belgrade and the lost ten-day war in Slovenia in July 1991. This made it possible for the Croatian troops to consolidate their forces and establish general control, which was also helped by foreign military forces. Already on September 19, there was a massive attack by Croatian armed units on the Yugoslav People's Army barracks, which were completely captured within a month. But as of September 1, 1991, clashes in Croatia were still local.

At the time of the business trip to Yugoslavia, the USSR State Radio and Television correspondent Viktor Nogin already had experience in the combat zone in Afghanistan. However, the Balkans were his love, because in 1972 Nogin graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of the University of Zagreb. But the flourishing and peaceful Yugoslavia, which he remembered from his youth, no longer existed.

Throughout August 1991, Viktor and his cameraman Gennady Kurinnoy traveled to the battlefields in Croatia almost every day, filmed, returned to Belgrade, and transported materials to Moscow. In the evening they watched the story on the *Vremya* program, after which they talked with colleagues until midnight. Yugoslav television often invited Viktor as a guest on their air to show exclusive footage of the fights.

On the morning of September 1, 1991, having filmed a celebratory assembly at the school at the USSR Embassy in Belgrade, Nogin and Kurinnoy left in the direction of Zagreb. They were going to shoot a material about the Serbo-Croatian armed conflict, to then overtake it to Moscow from the capital of Croatia. The journalists left in a dark blue Opel Omega car, which traveled many fronts of the Yugoslav war. Huge white letters TV were stuck on its hood and doors - such ones can be seen from afar. The license plates on the car were diplomatic - 10-A-155. But the journalists never made it to Zagreb.

Their relatives and colleagues, who then worked in the Balkans, got used to the frequent trips of Nogin and Kurinnoy, so at first, they were not worried. Only three days after his departure, when Nogin did not go on the air from Zagreb at the appointed time and did not call anyone, close correspondents sounded the alarm. After that, the search began.

Initially, the missing journalists were searched for by their colleagues who worked in the Balkans. Sergei Gryzunov, former chairman of the Russian press and mass communications committee, who headed the bureau of the Novosti Press Agency in Belgrade in 1991 and, together with colleagues, conducted a journalistic investigation into the incident, said: *“In the Serbian internment camp on the mountain of Manyacha, we found Croatian policemen, who were the last, except for the killers, who saw our guys alive.”*

According to him, the policemen confirmed that Russian journalists arrived in the morning of September 1 in Kostajnica, which was occupied by Croatian units, filmed there and headed towards Petrini, despite the warning that it was dangerous to go to Zagreb. One of the policemen said that ""the car was driven by the bigger one.""  Gryzunov explained: *“So this was Viktor, he was a head taller than his operator and 25 kilograms heavier.”*

*""We discovered the place of the tragedy on September 11th. A couple of kilometers from Kostajnitsa, a dark oil stain and traces of a burned-out car remained on the pavement. Also, we found the remains of the dark blue Opel: a gas tank cap, burnt tires, and moldings. There were furrows on the pavement - the car was pulled off the road.""*

At the same time, colleagues of the missing journalists were faced with the fact that the Serbian authorities were not eager to cooperate with the investigation. Their representatives hinted that ""it is not worth digging deep, because this could damage Serbian-Russian relations."" And witnesses who saw the missing journalists or knew something about what happened, in the presence of the Serbian police, as a rule, began to deny everything. In off-the-record conversations, residents of villages in the Kostajnica area already in September 1991 confidently asserted: *“Russian journalists were killed by the Serbian military.”* By a strange coincidence, many eyewitnesses who expressed a willingness to speak disappeared.

In the fall of 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Yugoslav side with a request to search for journalists. However, two months later, the Soviet Union and hope for government assistance in the investigation collapsed. After Gorbachev's appeal, the military prosecutor's office of Yugoslavia nevertheless opened a criminal case, and in April 1992 a burned car was even found, but there were no remains of journalists in it.

In the end, the prosecutors issued a ruling that the Yugoslav military was not involved in the disappearance of journalists, and transferred the case to the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. For more than a year, it lay motionless, until a Russian journalist, Nogin’s friend in Afghanistan Vladimir Mukusev, who was then a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, intervened again in the situation.

Mukusev said: *""In March 1993, I proposed the creation of a special parliamentary commission of inquiry. The Supreme Council voted unanimously in favor. At the suggestion of Khasbulatov, I was appointed chairman.”* Soon, in response to requests, Mukusev received a mountain of documents from various departments. It turned out that several structures were interested in the search for journalists: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Embassy, ​​which even appointed a premium of five thousand marks for any information. The Foreign Intelligence Service under the leadership of Yevgeny Primakov and the office of Vice President Alexander Rutskoy were also involved in the case.

At the same time, according to Mukusev, Primakov did not just respond to the request. *“We began to meet regularly, but not at his headquarters in Yasenevo, but at various secret addresses. He kept asking how things were going. But suddenly, at the end of the summer, he called himself and asked to come along with Galina Nogina. Primakov said that in 1991, most likely, a tragedy occurred. And then he asked me to talk in private. The head of intelligence showed the documents, from which I realized that not just a witness appeared, but an accomplice to the murder.”*

This witness was part of a group of 13 militsiyamen who were following orders from Milan Martić, then Minister of the Interior and later President of Serbian Krajina. The order was to get the source files of the videos that were filmed by journalists who worked on both front lines. 12 of those policemen, including the commander, then died under various circumstances.

Only one remained alive, and only because shortly after those events he was convicted of hooliganism, and when he came out a year and a half later, he learned from his wife that a prize had been appointed for information about the missing journalists. They hoped to get money and go to Germany. The wife of the former OMON agent went to the Russian embassy in Belgrade and told everything. According to her, her husband was ready to testify on record. Russian television journalists went to meet him.

As follows from the eyewitness account, the policemen were instructed to obtain information from journalists who worked on the Croatian side at any cost. The soldiers were told that they were Croatian spies. A special forces detachment took control of the road, along which a car with a conspicuous TV identification mark was supposed to go.

As the witness said: *""When the car appeared, they fired at the wheels, but the bullets passed at the level of the doors. Nogin was injured. Journalists were finished off with shots in the head, then they doused the car with gasoline and set it on fire.""*

They ordered a tractor driver from a nearby village to drag the remains several kilometers away, throw them into the river and crush the roof sticking out of the water with a bucket. After the beginning of the investigation, he again dragged the car to the side and buried the remains of journalists.

Mukusev said: *“We went to the witness with Primakov's employees. We traveled by train and found out in Belgrade that he had been killed the day before. All I had left was a diagram drawn by him, without reference to a place, and a video recording of his testimony. With this, we ended up in Serbian Krajina. For several days they tried in vain to get through to someone. But they didn't really want to talk to us. Suddenly, they told me that Martić wanted to see me alone in Banja Luka (now the capital of the Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina). He said that he was giving us a day to get out, otherwise, they would look for us even longer than those journalists.”*

In 2002, Milan Martić was handed over to the Hague Tribunal on charges of organizing ethnic cleansing. In court, in particular, he testified that he personally ordered to obtain materials from Russian journalists.

After a conversation with Martić, Mukusev went to the town of Glina (which was part of the Serbian Krajina, now the territory of Croatia), where the headquarters of the Yugoslav army and the Serbian military prosecutor's office were once located. *“When I appeared there in the investigator’s office and asked if they had any traces left, literally a minute later they brought me a search file. The investigator immediately wrote a decision to initiate a criminal case on the fact of the disappearance of journalists and a paper on the need to provide me with all kinds of assistance.”*

With documents, he again went to the area where the journalists were killed. On September 19, 1993, the local police began excavations based on the scheme that Mukusev had, but a day later the well-known decree of Russian President Boris Yeltsin No. 1400 was issued on the dissolution of the Supreme Council. *“Just now I was a deputy and suddenly turned out to be a completely private person, a foreigner. I was immediately given to understand that the search was ending. In Moscow, several high-ranking officials whom I addressed upon my return directly said: “We don’t need new problems in the Balkans. Forget it. Now, if only the Croats did it…”*

In 1995, after Operation Storm, Serbian Krajina became a territory of Croatia. And a couple of years later, a message was received from Zagreb that the Croatian army had seized documents about the interrogation by the military prosecutor's office of the Yugoslav People's Army of the captain and ensign of the army of Serbian Krajina, eyewitnesses of the attack on Nogin and Kurinnoy. These statements were forwarded to the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

However, requests from the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia for the transfer of materials about these two witnesses remained without a concrete answer. Federal Yugoslav authorities made it clear to Russian prosecutors that ""their investigation is undesirable"" and ""the past is dead."" At the beginning of 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ceased to exist, turning into the Community of Serbia and Montenegro, which, three years later, peacefully dispersed, becoming independent states. There has been a long lull in the case of the murder of Russian journalists.

In 2010, Mukusev approached Croatian President Ivo Josipović with a proposal to install a memorial sign at the site of the death of Russians, create a joint Russian-Croatian commission to finally find the remains and bury them, and also establish a personal scholarship at the University of Zagreb, which graduated from Viktor Nogin. So far, only one wish has been fulfilled: in May 2011, a memorial plaque was installed at the place of death of journalists. The ceremony was attended by Mukusev and the son of Gennady Kurinny.

The commemorative inscription on the tablet is in two languages, but their texts are radically different, and this is not a matter of subtleties or translation errors.

The inscription in Russian reads: *“On this spot on September 1, 1991, Russian journalists of the USSR State Radio and Television Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinnoy tragically died in the performance of their professional duty. Never forget""*. Caption in Croatian: *""Here on September 1, 1991, in the first months of the Patriotic War, members of the Serbian paramilitary units villainously killed Russian journalists Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinny.""*

On March 20, 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded journalists the Order of Courage ""for courage and dedication shown in the performance of official and civic duty"" posthumously. Despite the wording “posthumously,” the journalists are listed as missing because their remains have not yet been found.

However, the chances of finding the burial place of the journalists still remain. In February 2021, the Croatian Ministry of the Interior opened a criminal case against the perpetrators of the murder of Nogin and Kurinny. Without disclosing names, the prosecution announced that it had decided to investigate a citizen of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, born in 1957, as well as a citizen of BaH, born in 1965, on suspicion of committing a crime against humanity and international law.

According to the investigation, the attackers were 26 and 33 years old at the time of the crime, they were members of a Serbian paramilitary group. At the moment they are outside of Croatia.

Local media immediately reported that the suspects were named Ilija Cizmich and Zdravko Matiyasevic-Zabac and they lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Croatian Interior Ministry noted that the investigation was conducted with the international assistance of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Russia.

According to Croatian law enforcement officers, on September 1, 1991, Nogin and Kurinnoy entered the village of Hrvatska Kostajnica, which at that time was under the control of Croatian units. There, journalists recorded interviews with residents, members of the Croatian militia, and the police. The interlocutors warned them that the road from Kostajnica to Petrinja was not safe, but Nogin replied: *""Don't worry, I have experience in the Afghan war, you Croats are good people, and the Serbs are our brothers.""*

However, when a car with diplomatic plates drove up from Kostajnica, a group of criminals opened fire on the car with small arms. The wounded Viktor Nogin shouted *""Don't shoot, we are your brothers,""* but that didn't help.

When the car stopped, the shooters approached, and the 26-year-old suspect demanded that the wounded show their documents: passports and press cards. He then killed the journalists by shooting them in the head with a pistol. Most of the members of the unit, including its commander, the second suspect, became witnesses.

The Interior Ministry said in the statement: *“Although the 33-year-old suspect, as a commander, was obliged to prevent the shooter, he did nothing and, together with members of the group, took several actions to conceal the circumstances of the crime.”* Later, the journalists' car was looted and burned along with the corpses. The charred remains were hidden in the territory, which was then controlled by the Serbs. Most of the described facts have been known since 1992. The only news is that the perpetrators have been identified and are still alive.

Information about whether Croatia applied to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a request for the extradition of the suspects in the murder of Nogin and Kurinnoy is not publicly available. Thus, in this case, instead of a dot, there is still an ellipsis...

65,CherryBlossom724,[],1642229947,"**Background**

The Javanese court poet Raden Ngabahi Ranggawarsita spent decades researching and writing a sprawling history of Java entitled the *Book of Kings*, the first edition of which was published in 1869. Side note: this book is thousands of pages long and it was said that Ranggawarsita wrote three pages of it per day for thirty years. A reference to the eruption appears in the early part of his history called ""The Book of Ancient Kings"" and reads as follows:

&gt; The whole world was greatly shaken, and violent thundering, accompanied by heavy rain and storms took place, but not only did not this heavy rain extinguish the eruption of the fire of the mountain Kapi, but augmented the fire; the noise was fearful, at last the mountain Kapi with a tremendous roar burst into pieces and sank into the deepest of the earth. The water of the sea rose and inundated the land, the country to the east of the mountain Batuwara, to the mountain Raja Basa, was inundated by the sea; the inhabitants of the northern part of the Sunda country to the mountain Raja Basa, were drowned and swept away with all their property.

A second edition of *Book of Kings* was published in 1885 and provides a much more detailed account of the eruption, as well as including the year of the event this time, which you can see in the following short excerpt:

&gt; In the year Saka* 338 (AD 416) a thundering noise was heard from the mountain Batuwara, which was answered by a similar noise coming from the mountain Kapi, lying westward of the modern Bantam. A great glaring fire which reached the sky came out of the last-named mountain. The whole world was greatly shaken and violent thundering accompanied by heavy rains and storms took place.

It is unknown to which mountain ""Kapi"" is referring, since that name is no longer used, but due to certain geographical clues in the text, it is thought that ""Kapi"" is actually Krakatoa. 

It is believed that Ranggawarsita likely referenced primary source material in the writing of his book, but there is a question as to which sources he used, since we know very little about his bibliography. However, it can be surmised that he most likely referenced ancient Javanese manuscripts that had been written on palm leaves, and of which the Kraton library in Solo (in Java) possessed many. Ten thousand of these palm leaf texts, written in a variety of manuscript styles, survive today. Though relatively few of them actually relate to the ancient history of Java.

Ranggawarsita's book also mentions a man named Jayabaya, the monarch who supposedly oversaw the documenting of the accounts of this volcanic eruption. According to this story, Jayabaya was visited by a Hindu god named Naraddha, who informed him of this eruption and encouraged him to make a record of it. Naraddha told Jayabaya that this event took place in the 338th year of the Shaka Calendar (AD 416). Jayabaya was a real Javanese king in the 12th century. So, was this myth built around a real event? 

Beyond the aforementioned sources, there is no further evidence that this eruption actually happened. 

**Did he get the date wrong?**

There is both ice core and tree ring evidence for a massive eruption having occurred in either Java or Sumatra around AD 535. Possibly an eruption of Krakatoa? Going back to the *Book of Kings*, Ranggawarsita included entries relating to a large portion of the days covered by the book. However, there are notably far fewer entries for the eighteen years following the eruption of AD 535, suggesting that something happened that was a big enough deal to disrupt the palm leaf writings of the scribes for nearly two decades. 

It's also important to note the years following AD 416 hint at no such disruption in the writing of the palm leaf histories.

**Conclusion**

Were these two supposed early eruptions of Krakatoa actually just one eruption?

*The Shaka Calendar was the Hindu dating system used exclusively on these islands and which began in the year AD 78.

Anyway, it seems many people speculate poor mental health, from manic episodes to suicide ideation, to be a major factor in some unresolved disappearances / deaths.  
Sometimes, a victim’s mental distress is evident like with the all famous Elisa Lam case, but what are other cases yall know of where extreme mental distress was speculated but overlooked?

I’m interested in this topic because I know many people who are actually ashamed of their mental health issues and only talk about it in the form of (cynical) “jokes” or when they’re blackout drunk.  
Not that I’m worried they’ll just disappear or something, I’m just interested in how our culture’s perceptions of mental health may impact breaks in unsolved mysteries.   Do investigators consider it a factor even if the victim’s despair or plan to leave isn’t incredibly
 evident?

On the other hand, another consideration of the subject is the internet’s normalization of expressing mental distress- I’d like to learn about more cases where investigators took to a victim’s social media to pick up any clues.

Police investigating the disappearance of Andrew Godsen took the electronics as the pair were held on suspicion of kidnap and human trafficking.

73,EvilMojoNoob,[],1642192979,"Originaly from Split, Croatia, Matej decided to celebrate New Year with a group of his six male friends by taking a trip to Belgrade. They arrived in the city on Dec 30th, in the late afternoon hours. Shortly after they unpacked, they contacted their families just to check in with them. Then, they went into a restaurant to have a dinner, and shortly after decided to go into a famous club named ""Gotik"" at around 10pm. 

They were partying and having fun for a few hours, when suddenly, at around 1:30am, his friends noticed that Matej was missing. They didn't sweat it at first, because they thought he just got lost in the crowd and would eventually show up, being that they also noticed his jacket was still in the club's wardrobe. After a night out, they returned to their apartment, still thinking that Matej would show up. 

The following morning, he was still nowhere to be found so they contacted police at around 6pm the following day and the investigation began. What they found out was quite... bizarre, to say the least.

In [this video](https://youtu.be/kG8D3b4tCyQ) of the latest press conference from Serbian police, you can see complete footage from the CC cameras around the city. It was found out that he seemingly, out of nowhere, rushed out of the club around 1:43am and kept running aimlessly throughout the city for the next 10 to 15 minutes, behaving very strangely. He runs in the middle of a road and intersection, tries to stop and forcefully get into a taxi, jumps over fences and ultimately vanishes into thin air at the shore of Sava river, near restaurant ""Savanova"", just a few hundred meters south of the club. He was wearing a T-shirt even though it was barely several degrees outside, yet he left his jacket at the club. 

Since this video is in Serbian language, I'll just list here the most important things the officer says:

* the footage showed that there was no one chasing after him, or anyone that he was chasing. He seemed to be on his own for the whole duration of the trip.
* the part where he tries to holler a taxi was the only confirmed time he was having an interaction with someone else since he went missing. Apparently, the taxi driver didn't let him in the car because he already had a reservation for someone else. He didn't seem drunk or drugged to him, but rather like he was in a hurry and just wanted to get somewhere fast.
* the footage at 7 minutes and 30 seconds was the last known confirmed footage of him, after that he was nowhere to be found. He didn't return back to the club, he didn't go any other way, he just climbed down to the shore and disappeared.
* it is known he was drinking alcohol at the club with his friends, but it is unclear whether he was on drugs, with some suspecting he indeed consumed something. It is also unclear whether he had an interaction with someone at the terrace of the restaurant and met foul play, or whether he jumped into the river by accident and drown under the influence of the supstance he was consuming.
* the last known location of his mobile phone matched the location of the object that was seen floating through the river in the last two clips, but it is unclear whether that is a person, or something else. They don't know whether Matej ended up in the river at all. They just know his last known location was at the terrace in front of the restaurant, directly in front of the river.
* all of his friend passed polygraph questioning and they, including many other eyewitnesses, said that they haven't noticed anything unusual at the club that would result in him disappearing. Some of them noticed a conflict between two groups of people, but nothing out of the ordinary, they thought it was typical nightclubbing-alcohol induced behaviour.
* the last known interaction of him before disappearing is a phone call he made shortly before exiting the club. He called his female friend that was also in the city and wanted for to get together with her group of friends in order to party together.

A 70-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of killing a man in Crestline after authorities reopened a 28-year old cold case, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s officials reported.

Diane Elizabeth Cook remained in custody Thursday at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, with bail set at $1 million, sheriff’s booking records show.

The San Bernardino County Superior Court on Tuesday charged Cook with murder, according to court records, which show no scheduled court date.

Cook was arrested at 1:52 p.m. Wednesday in the 24600 block of Bernard Drive in Crestline on suspicion of killing 35-year-old Rick Hafty, sheriff’s officials reported.

On Feb. 27, 1993, Twin Peaks Sheriff’s Station deputies responded to a call for service at a residence for a shot man. The victim was later identified as Hafty, sheriff’s officials said.

Hafty was transported to San Bernardino Medical Center and was pronounced dead from the gunshot wound. Homicide investigators responded to the location and conducted an investigation. At the time, investigators exhausted all leads and the case remained open.

75,ArtemisDax,[],1642190800,"**How awful is** ***My Immortal*****, anyway?**

The mystery of Tara Gilesbie and Raven.

**What is** ***My Immortal***?

*My Immortal* is a ‘Harry Potter’ fan fiction written by Tara Gilesbie and edited by Raven in 2006 and 2007. It consists of 44 chapters and over 22,000 words. The author of chapters 39 and 40 claimed to be a troll who hacked Tara’s account, and exhibits a significantly different style of writing. The author of chapter 41 claims to be Tara once again in control of her own account, but curiously she left the ‘hacked’ chapter on her account as she posted 41-44. [Fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/) removed *My Immortal* in 2008. Tara Gilesbie and Raven subsequently abandon their Fanfiction.net accounts and despite several debunked claims over the years, there has never been a confirmed contact with either one since.

**Who are Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

While there has been some limited discussion of very early internet sightings of Raven and/or Tara, the saga really starts when Raven first appears first on [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/). Her real name may be Jennie, and she wrote a bad Harry Potter fic called *I'm Not Okay.* No one has ever been successfully connected to any of the ‘real names’ of either of the authors. Most people believe that they are American, despite references to *dubya* (read: Dubai or “W”) and visiting Transylvania. They claim to be goths who shop at Hot Topic, love My Chemical Romance, hate preps and Hillary Duff, and have never read any of the Harry Potter books.

**The Worst Fan Fiction in the World!**

Although there are a handful of other popular contenders, *My Immortal* is generally believed to be one of the worst works to ever grace the internet. The writing is juvenile, the plot is inscrutable, and the characters overdone to the point of being charactures. The spelling and grammar are borderline illegible in places. The author’s notes specifically are written in an over the top early aughts texting lingo that makes your eyes bleed. *I’m Not Okay,* purportedly authored by Raven, features many of the same traits including the absolutely hilarious physical descriptions of characters, but is slightly better executed. This meshes with the fact that the dubious quality of the work takes a nosedive without her editing, a break usually traced to a stolen sweater after chapter 15. The only really legible chapters were written by the hacker.

**A work of trolling genius?**

Many people look at these traits and decide that no one could possibly write such an awful fic seriously. It is so bad, it’s not only good, it was bad on purpose. Additional points frequently mentioned include Harry Potter references not found in the movies, humorously misused SAT words, and references to pop culture that do not seem to fit with either the persona of Tara Gilesbie or Raven, such as Tom Bombadil a character only found in the Lord of the Rings Books. Others think that the fic was started at least somewhat on the level and devolved over time. Some go as far to say that the entire network of Raven and Tara accounts were built over time by a single, unusually dedicated, troll.

**But is it actually all that bad?**

*My Immortal* has been a meme for over a decade, and quotes drawn from the worst passages are constantly being passed around. But I realized I’d never sat down and actually \*read\* any of it. I’m not going to tell you it’s good. It’s not. The tone is incredibly juvenile and little of the plot structure or characters make much sense. But the actual writing isn’t significantly different from many other less than stellar fics I’ve seen. The grammar and punctuation is imperfect, but perfectly reasonable in most places given how frankly bizarre the rules of English are. If the sentence was readable and not too far off from common usage I gave them a pass. I counted the errors in three categories: text/slang(obviously intentional), wrong word, and true mistakes.

**No one ever knows the ending: The First Era of My Immortal**

Chapters 1-10

I think people forget, distracted by the beautiful dumpster fire it became, that there was a time when *My Immortal* wasn’t *My Immortal*. It was just another bad Harry Potter fic. Getting the attention of the internet, good or bad, isn’t easy. Most bad fics get a few negative reviews and slowly fade out of memory. This is what happened to *I’m Not Okay,* Raven’s fic. Despite having many of the hallmarks of its more famous sibling, no one paid much attention. If *My Immortal* was always intended as an extended trolling joke, it would have been a lot of work to set up all the accounts for little hope of a real payoff. In fact, the first three chapters of *My Immortal* has just *one* misused word. It’s stupid and silly, but perfectly readable English. This pattern continues through the first ten chapters. And many of the errors are understandable. Off written as of. Forhead instead of forehead. All of the characters are spelled correctly (including Hogsmeade, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Voldemort) and all in their correct capacity. For a pair of trolls, this is remarkably tame. In fact, there are only a bare handful of things that would even be catchable by spellcheck. My Immortal appears to have been *spellchecked*.

Chapters 11 and 12

And then everything goes insane. The error rate jumps from a little under 1%, most of it obviously intentional or understandable to a whopping 7.2%. Most people think that these chapters were reviewed by Raven before posting. The author’s note from 11 even thanks her: *AN: i sed stup flaming up prepz! c if dis chaptr is srupid!1111 it delz wit rly sris issus! sp c 4 urself if itz ztupid brw fangz 2 ma frend raven 4 hleping me! (I said stop flaming you preps! See if this chapter is stupid! It deals with really serious issues. See for yourself if it’s stupid. By the way, thanks to my friend Raven for helping me!)* But the note from 12 reveals something interesting: *SPECIAL FANGZ 2 RAVEN MY GOFFIX BLOOD SISTA WTF UR SUPPOZD 2 RIT DIS!11111111* HEY RAVEN DO U KNOW WHERE MY SWEATER I (Special thanks to Raven my gothic blood sister. What the fuck you are supposed to write this! Hey Raven do you know where my sweater is?) Aside from the beginning of the sweater drama, Tara seems to be implying that Raven isn’t doing her job. This matches with the marked deterioration of these two chapters. This is also where two of the classic features of *My Immortal* are introduced. The texting lingo from the author’s notes has crept into the story itself, and the character names are now all over the board.

Chapters 13-15.

Raven’s back! And the mistakes are being fixed again. But Tara and Raven seem to have learned something. I wish the original comments section had been preserved. But based on what the internet is still fixated on, I’d say they got a lot of attention for both the texting slang and the character names. Those are here to stay. Like most creators, Tara and Raven are learning from feedback what gets them comments.

**So who** ***are*** **Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

I believe it is an underestimated possibility that, at least at the beginning, *My Immortal* is exactly what it appears to be on the surface. An earnest, but bad, first attempt at fic written by two very young authors. I think that most people also overestimate their age. The awkward sex scenes and increased mistakes in these paragraphs indicate to me that Tara and Raven are in early middle school. Claiming not to have read Harry Potter is complete bullshit. But they are exploring other interests and developing the Tara and Raven personas, using a previous interest to do so. They still like Harry Potter, but it's not cool anymore. Goths, vampires, sex, and angsty music are cool. What are goths, vampires, sex, and angsty music? They're not sure yet. I think this explains some of the oddities of their interests and references. They're trying too hard even in the author's notes. Fairly intelligent girls trying to distance themselves from childhood things like fantasy. What's more 12 than writing a Harry Potter fic to prove you're goth and cool?

Ignoring everything that came later, what does the first era of *My Immortal* mean to you?

**Richard Clements** was a 72-year-old double amputee living alone in his apartment on 13F, 1 Coin St in the suburbs of Etobicoke, Toronto. On Dec 3, 2008, his body was found at his apartment. He was lying on the ground over a large pool of blood. Beside him was his overturned wheelchair and a ""non-functional"" cellphone. Richard was pronounced dead at the scene.

A small amount of cash was missing. Some quarters and nickels were found scattered on the staircases of the apartment block, which seems to indicate a low-level robbery. There was no sign of forced entry. Richard's prosthetic limbs were found on his motorized scooter, which had been left in the hallway. A set of bloody footprint (later identified to be Nike Air Edge) led right out of Richard's apartment, went across the hall, down a flight of stairs to 12F and to the apartment directly underneath Richard's. However, the footprints never stepped inside the 12F apartment.

Post-mortem examinations determined Richard died of multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest. Toronto case files currently list his date of death as Dec 2, the day before his body was discovered. There were traces of blood across different floors of the entire apartment building. However, it was found out in 2021 (see below) that the DNA profile of the scattered blood did not match the DNA profile retrieved from the immediate crime scene. There is a possibility of more than one perpetrator.

**The victim**

Richard was described by his friend as someone who ""had a heart bigger than his brain."" Police described him as having a ""blind trust in others."" He often left his door unlocked for his neighbors, possibly explaining the lack of sign of forced entry. He had a habit of lending money to others. Before the amputation, Richard worked as a hairdresser for a short while, before operating his own copy shop. Richard was openly gay, and did a lot of free printing for LGBTQ-owned businesses. According to his friends, Richard operated the shop at a loss. Most of his employees were LGBTQ. He also volunteered at Casey House, the only stand-alone hospital for people with HIV/AIDS in Canada. In the mid-2000s, both his legs were amputated after a botched gallbladder removal surgery. He was forced to move out of his disability-unfriendly home and to 1 Coin St. By the time of his death, he had been living in the apartment for one and a half years. During this time, he ""lived on a modest disability pension and volunteered.""

**The 12F apartment**

The 12F apartment belonged to **Michael Edge**, a fellow double amputee and a close friend of Richard. In fact, the last time Richard was seen alive was by Michael - when Richard was walking Michael's dog on the day of his death. The building’s property manager recounted that, a few days before the murder, Michael visited his office and gave him a peculiar warning. “He came into my office and said that something is happening that he does not like, and he's afraid somebody would get injured.” When the property manager advised Michael to notify the police, Michael responded that he was too scared to make the call.

Detectives now believe that the killer was trying to frame Michael with the footprints. (Because he is also a double amputee, the footprints could not have been his.) Detectives believe that Michael knew who the perpetrator was. Michael never named the perpetrator, though police described him as ""co-operative."" Detectives believe Michael was afraid of meeting the same fate as Richard. After the murder, the property manager noted that Michael started carrying a hammer with him. Michael died a year later, in 2009, of natural causes. His body was thoroughly examined to rule out any foul play.

**The witness who discovered the body**

The body was found by **Raymond Hicks**, a close friend of Richard's. Raymond was a heroin user who apparently would steal from Richard, even ""his mother’s diamond ring, or paintings off his walls."" Raymond would also, according to one eyewitness account, threaten Richard when he refused to give him money. Despite this, Richard still kept Raymond around as a friend. DNA evidence has ruled out Raymond as the killer. Raymond went to visit Richard shortly after midnight (Personal note - though police case files list police respond time at 12:18 p.m. Probably some discrepancy) and found the door open. When Raymond found the body, he attempted to call 911 with the apartment phone, but ""it was not working,"" so he went to Michael's apartment. Michael called 911, relaying what Raymond told him. Raymond died in 2011.

**Investigation progress**

Police theorized the following:

* The perpetrator was acquainted with both Richard and Michael
* Michael knew who the perpetrator was
* The perpetrator was familiar with the apartment building and the surrounding area

In 2009, police offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.

In 2021, DNA from the crime scene was re-examined. A DNA profile, believed to be the killer's, was extracted, though no match was found through the national offender databank. Police were retrieving DNA from people involved with the case.

My questions:

* Why frame a double amputee with footprints if the killer knew Michael?
* Why rob and murder if the picture of the victim as a generous man is true?
* Why escalate a low-level robbery to a murder? It was unlikely that the victim could resist or fight back.

77,ArtemisDax,[],1642185884,"**How awful is** ***My Immortal*****, anyway?**

The mystery of Tara Gillesbe and Raven.

**What is** ***My Immortal*****?**

*My Immortal* is a ‘Harry Potter’ fan fiction written by Tara Gilesbie and edited by Raven in 2006 and 2007. It consists of 44 chapters and over 22,000 words. The author of chapters 39 and 40 claimed to be a troll who hacked Tara’s account, and exhibits a significantly different style of writing. The author of chapter 41 claims to be Tara once again in control of her own account, but curiously she left the ‘hacked’ chapter on her account as she posted 41-44. [Fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/) removed *My Immortal* in 2008. Tara Gilesbie and Raven subsequently abandon their Fanfiction.net accounts and despite several debunked claims over the years, there has never been a confirmed contact with either one since.

**Who are Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

While there has been some limited discussion of very early internet sightings of Raven and/or Tara, the saga really starts when Raven first appears first on [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/). Her real name may be Jennie, and she wrote a bad Harry Potter fic called *I'm Not Okay.* No one has ever been successfully connected to any of the ‘real names’ of either of the authors. Most people believe that they are American, despite references to *dubya* (read: Dubai or “W”) and visiting Transylvania. They claim to be goths who shop at Hot Topic, love My Chemical Romance, hate preps and Hillary Duff, and have never read any of the Harry Potter books.

**The Worst Fan Fiction in the World!**

Although there are a handful of other popular contenders, *My Immortal* is generally believed to be one of the worst works to ever grace the internet. The writing is juvenile, the plot is inscrutable, and the characters overdone to the point of being charactures. The spelling and grammar are borderline illegible in places. The author’s notes specifically are written in an over the top early aughts texting lingo that makes your eyes bleed. *I’m Not Okay,* purportedly authored by Raven, features many of the same traits including the absolutely hilarious physical descriptions of characters, but is slightly better executed. This meshes with the fact that the dubious quality of the work takes a nosedive without her editing, a break usually traced to a stolen sweater after chapter 15. The only really legible chapters were written by the hacker.

**A work of trolling genius?**

Many people look at these traits and decide that no one could possibly write such an awful fic seriously. It is so bad, it’s not only good, it was bad on purpose. Additional points frequently mentioned include Harry Potter references not found in the movies, humorously misused SAT words, and references to pop culture that do not seem to fit with either the persona of Tara Gilesbie or Raven, such as Tom Bombadil a character only found in the Lord of the Rings Books. Others think that the fic was started at least somewhat on the level and devolved over time. Some go as far to say that the entire network of Raven and Tara accounts were built over time by a single, unusually dedicated, troll.

**But is it actually all that bad?**

*My Immortal* has been a meme for over a decade, and quotes drawn from the worst passages are constantly being passed around. But I realized I’d never sat down and actually \*read\* any of it. I’m not going to tell you it’s good. It’s not. The tone is incredibly juvenile and little of the plot structure or characters make much sense. But the actual writing isn’t significantly different from many other less than stellar fics I’ve seen. The grammar and punctuation is imperfect, but perfectly reasonable in most places given how frankly bizarre the rules of English are. If the sentence was readable and not too far off from common usage I gave them a pass. I counted the errors in three categories: text/slang(obviously intentional), wrong word, and true mistakes. 

**No one ever knows the ending: The First Era of My Immortal**

Chapters 1-10

I think people forget, distracted by the beautiful dumpster fire it became, that there was a time when *My Immortal* wasn’t *My Immortal*. It was just another bad Harry Potter fic. Getting the attention of the internet, good or bad, isn’t easy. Most bad fics get a few negative reviews and slowly fade out of memory. This is what happened to *I’m Not Okay,* Raven’s fic. Despite having many of the hallmarks of its more famous sibling, no one paid much attention. If *My Immortal* was always intended as an extended trolling joke, it would have been a lot of work to set up all the accounts for little hope of a real payoff. In fact, the first three chapters of *My Immortal* has just *one* misused word. It’s stupid and silly, but perfectly readable English. This pattern continues through the first ten chapters. And many of the errors are understandable. Off written as of. Forhead instead of forehead. All of the characters are spelled correctly (including Hogsmeade, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Voldemort) and all in their correct capacity. For a pair of trolls, this is remarkably tame. In fact, there are only a bare handful of things that would even be catchable by spellcheck. My Immortal appears to have been *spellchecked*.

Chapters 11 and 12

And then everything goes insane. The error rate jumps from a little under 1%, most of it obviously intentional or understandable to a whopping 7.2%. Most people think that these chapters were reviewed by Raven before posting. The author’s note from 11 even thanks her: *AN: i sed stup flaming up prepz! c if dis chaptr is srupid!1111 it delz wit rly sris issus! sp c 4 urself if itz ztupid brw fangz 2 ma frend raven 4 hleping me! (I said stop flaming you preps! See if this chapter is stupid! It deals with really serious issues. See for yourself if it’s stupid. By the way, thanks to my friend Raven for helping me!)* But the note from 12 reveals something interesting: *SPECIAL FANGZ 2 RAVEN MY GOFFIX BLOOD SISTA WTF UR SUPPOZD 2 RIT DIS!11111111* HEY RAVEN DO U KNOW WHERE MY SWEATER I (Special thanks to Raven my gothic blood sister. What the fuck you are supposed to write this! Hey Raven do you know where my sweater is?) Aside from the beginning of the sweater drama, Tara seems to be implying that Raven isn’t doing her job. This matches with the marked deterioration of these two chapters. This is also where two of the classic features of *My Immortal* are introduced. The texting lingo from the author’s notes has crept into the story itself, and the character names are now all over the board.

Chapters 13-15.

Raven’s back! And the mistakes are being fixed again. But Tara and Raven seem to have learned something. I wish the original comments section had been preserved. But based on what the internet is still fixated on, I’d say they got a lot of attention for both the texting slang and the character names. Those are here to stay. Like most creators, Tara and Raven are learning from feedback what gets them comments.

**So who** ***are*** **Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

I believe it is an underestimated possibility that, at least at the beginning, *My Immortal* is exactly what it appears to be on the surface. An earnest, but bad, first attempt at fic written by two very young authors. I think that most people also overestimate their age. The awkward sex scenes and increased mistakes in these paragraphs indicate to me that Tara and Raven are in early middle school. Claiming not to have read Harry Potter is complete bullshit. But they are exploring other interests and developing the Tara and Raven personas, using a previous interest to do so. They still like Harry Potter, but it's not cool anymore. Goths, vampires, sex, and angsty music are cool. What are goths, vampires, sex, and angsty music? They're not sure yet. I think this explains some of the oddities of their interests and references. They're trying too hard even in the author's notes. Fairly intelligent girls trying to distance themselves from childhood things like fantasy. What's more 12 than writing a Harry Potter fic to prove you're goth and cool?

Ignoring everything that came later, what does the first era of *My Immortal* mean to you?

Podcast version [https://unsettledtruecrime.podbean.com/](https://unsettledtruecrime.podbean.com/)

This is an update on Episode 1, Deanie Peters, which had its first major break since 1981. This episode will not only cover the arrest of JF, but will include additional and clarifying information mostly from the WZZM13 Investigates Facebook page. I will be covering all of the original information again in this episode. 

**INTRO**

The year is 1981. Ronald Reagan takes office, the first test tube baby is born, and MTV hits the airwaves.

That’s how long ago Deanie Peters disappeared. 

**THE DISAPPEARANCE**

Deanie was a 14 year old eighth grader attending her 6 year old brother W’s wrestling practice with her mom, M. M’s good friend A saw Deanie coming down the stairs at about 4:45 p.m as she arrived to pick up her son P, who had ridden to wrestling practice with the Peters family. Deanie waved to A and said she was going to the restroom and would be right back. 

That’s where this forty year old mystery begins.

The disappearance took place on February 5th 1981, at Forest Hill Central Middle School, which is in one of if not the safest neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I previously said elementary school, but that was not accurate. Even today people let their kids wander on bikes throughout the suburb. It’s a desirable area. This area is referred to in the news by many names, the general area of the city is called Forest Hills. Cascade is a prime street running through Forest Hills. The middle school is not far from Cascade.

The day of the disappearance, campus was busy. One facebook comment says they were there that day, and whatever happened must have been quick with all the activity.

There were about 75 people in total in the two level gym. The upper level held the wrestling meet. Photos of the wrestling team cannot be found in yearbooks because it was not a Forest Hills Public School System event. Their wrestling program wasn’t large enough, so children from any district were allowed to join. Matches were random rather than by school. 

The lower level of the gym had an aerobics class taking place.

The highschool, which shares a campus with the middle school, had a ‘donkey basketball game’ about two hours after the disappearance, which is where you actually dress up as donkeys and play basketball. There is no solid record of who participated in the game. 

**THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION**

**RUNAWAY**

Initially when Deanie did not return, not too much alarm was raised. It was thought she might have stopped to view another school event. The school was thoroughly searched. 

Police were called at 6:42p.m. This would have been roughly when the donkey basketball game was beginning at the high school. Police, though, thought Deanie might have run away to go live with her father and four siblings in California, despite her leaving pretty much everything behind including her savings. The lead detective assigned to the case, KK, had spent 5 years tracing runaway children. A classmate of Deanie’s said back in 1981 that Deanie did spend the night at a friend's house after arguing with her parents on more than one occasion. 

**NOT A RUNAWAY**

After 24 hours without contact from Deanie, search efforts intensified. Volunteers scoured nearby areas. Searches were conducted by helicopter and horseback. Parents waiting in the parking lot said they did not see Deanie, or anything out of the ordinary. Children from the school were interviewed in groups. Some children had not been aware anyone had disappeared until the following day. The community tied ribbons around trees and organized searches. 

After two weeks, no evidence had been found. A drawing of a possible suspect was made but never released to the public. 

**HYPNOSIS SIGHTING**

A woman on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class that day and says she saw Deanie and another girl walk across the gym heading to the girls room. This may be the same person who told investigators under hypnosis that they saw Deanie at 5:10p.m. walking inside the school with another girl, who had dark, shoulder length hair. This girl has yet to be identified. 

Rumors about the school incinerator were dispelled. Deanie’s stepfather J, and the school custodian AD were ruled out as suspects. 

**AD**

AD was approached by M and J at the school, and offered his condolences. He said he told them the same thing he told investigators; That three high school aged boys, one in a green and white Forest Hills Central letter jacket, banged on the locked doors of the school to be let in during the practice. AD did not recognize the boys as students, and refused. M said she does not remember this conversation. AD passed away in 2013. 

**MAN WATCHING AEROBICS**

A tip was received about a man standing in the doorway watching the aerobics class. Police found this man, who said he was waiting for his girlfriend, a part time music teacher at the school. Police could not connect him to Deanie. Witnesses disagree on if this was actually the man seen that night. One person on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class and not have seen any unusual man, suggesting he may have looked like he fit in. 

**PHONE CALLS**

Two odd phone calls were received by friends of Deanie’s, three days apart. One was around 8:30p.m.on a Wednesday to a close family friend. There was only a whimpering sound. When asked if it was Deanie, the caller hung up.

The second call was on February 28th to GD. GD was the nickname of Deanie’s boyfriend, Larry, who she mentioned in a letter to her dad. He was 17 at the time of dating Deanie, but told the papers he was 15 to avoid looking bad. The call was long-distance, from a girl who called herself “Beth”. GD wasn’t home to take the call and his mother declined to accept the charges. 

A close friend of Deanie’s also claims to have received several hang up calls, primarily late at night. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION**

In 2008 the Kent County Metro Cold Case Team was formed thanks to efforts by A. Some people asked how A is connected to this case. She’s the last person left in Grand Rapids to push the case. Deanie’s family ultimately moved away from the area.  

Over 400 interviews were conducted, 7 states visited, and up to 15 possible burial sites were searched. These include a Young Marines camp in Keene township, an area in Montcalm County, an area near Whitneyville and 92nd Ave, a shallow pond along Grand River Drive, and a mound of rocks. 

An age progression of Deanie is available in our source material.

Initially it was believed no one saw Deanie on her way to the restroom. However, a student may have said hello to her as she walked toward the bathroom. Deanie may have also been seen walking near the back door of the school with another girl. Someone reportedly saw a girl matching Deanie’s description willingly get into a car in the middle school parking lot. 

The disappearance was reconstructed. Efforts were focused on JF, KF, and SO. All three graduated from Caledonia High School. 

**J.O.F &amp; J.E.F.**

One woman claimed while canoeing in 1989, a man named J.O.F. talked about how he and two others hit a girl named Deanie with their car in a school parking lot. They put her in the trunk, and buried her along the Flat River. The two other men are rumored to be J.E.F. of the same last name and DM. According to rumors all three were friends of a man named BB. One person believes Jeff F and someone named GP  were involved, and mentions a long winding road that takes you to a property by a forest with a pond owned by one of the two men, who travelled often for work in a truck. J.E.F. allegedly has a violent history and a history with law enforcement. J.E.F. was married to MO. MO’s brother allegedly knew Deanie. 

This person also says that after Brent’s interview with M, M could no longer find Deanie’s horse collection from her bedroom. I’m not sure, but they may be referring to Brent Ashcroft who covered Deanie’s story with WZZM 13. 

**BB**

J.O.F. told detectives in the early 90s that he heard BB talk about killing Deanie while drunk and crying at a kegger near the sod farms off Grand River Drive near Lowell, and that she was buried near the old one room schoolhouse. This tip was investigated with no luck. 

BB may have been married to J.O.F.’s relative, Beth. Beth is the same name as the girl who called GD collect in the weeks after the disappearance, it’s unknown if that is connected. 

Investigators were never able to rule BB out as a suspect. He was 17 and living in Lowell at the time. The common rumor is that BB saw Deanie and drove his car at her to scare her, hit a patch of ice, and accidentally ran over and killed her. It’s thought Deanie may have left the school to smoke a cigarette.

BB reportedly confessed to the killing to somewhere between 20 and 30 people who did not believe him. 

His first wife called BB violent and abusive, and said he would sometimes black out after drinking with no memory. She claims he once pushed her out of a moving vehicle and broke her ankle, and another time threatened to run her off the road. 

In a phone interview, BB said he had a dream about Deanie after seeing her story on TV, but said he had never actually met her. He couldn't remember details about the dream, only that he told friends about it, and it somehow snowballed into how he had killed Deanie, maybe hit her with his car or truck, and buried her. 

A facebook comment claims BB had to leave to Somerset after being harassed by police and possibly refused to come back even for a family funeral. 

Here’s a quote from BB, back when he owned a repair shop: quote ""When I was a kid, I used to have this mental telepathy thing. I could tell things, like when a bird comes into your house and tells you someone's going to die. Everybody just keeps carrying it different ways."" end quote.

I looked up the bird comment, and a bird flying into a closed window is considered to be a bad omen, typically that someone will die. I believe BB was saying he had a sense for bad omens. 

BB died of a heart attack in 2008 before being questioned by the Cold Case Team. I previously said BB had never been interviewed in regards to Deanie, that was not accurate. KK received a tip about BB a few weeks after the disappearance, and interviewed BB two or three months after the disappearance. BB said he had nothing to do with it, and they had nothing to hold him. 

**THE ALTERCATION**

It was discovered that two days before her disappearance, Deanie had an altercation with at least two other girls over a boy, possibly BB, where they told her to stay away from him. It may or may not have been physical. Those involved were identified and interviewed by police. 

**THE DIARY**

In 2008, KK was subpoenaed for the return of Deanie’s Diary. After retirement, KK had focused his efforts on solving Deanie’s case, along with A. He says the diary was returned to M, but M does not recall receiving it. KK also says he read the diary very closely and there was nothing useful in it. However, that comment was made before KK learned of the confrontation Deanie had in the days before her death. 

KK alleged that several witnesses claim they gave statements, and that information was never passed on to him. Detectives repeatedly took statements, but did not file reports. 

**CORRUPTION**

**AD**

Sgt. CB says he was unable to track all potential leads in Deanie’s case. This includes being unable to fly to Arizona to interview Deanie’s mother and stepfather, and being unable to interview the school custodian AD. However, the press found AD living about a mile from the Sheriff's department, where he had lived for the past 15 years. 

AD believed the police targeted him for being hispanic. He was locked in a cell overnight and made to testify in front of a grand jury about a month after the disappearance. His only criminal record at the time was for drinking and driving. He stated he was cleaning a school office the night of the disappearance and never saw Deanie. AD said he was never asked to give a description or look at mugshots regarding the three boys he refused to let in the building.

**FRYLING**

Sgt. CB also claimed to have faced roadblocks in the investigation of the 1993 murder of millionaire Robert Fryling. There is essentially nothing online about the case, I had to reach out to the local library to get details. 

Robert Fryling was the well connected and influential owner of Fryling Construction in the 90s. His stepdaughter Maria married Doug DeVos, son of Amway’s Rich DeVos Sr.  Robert had a reputation as a loving husband and family man, when he was suddenly murdered in his 6,400 square foot home. 

The Fryling case went unsolved for eight years until Pietro Terrel and Christine VanMeter were arrested in 2001 with the help of a retired FBI agent, who was reportedly paid the equivalent of $54,000 per year as a cold case investigator. Officials said in 2001 that the same investigator would be looking into Deanie's case. 

It came out that the pimp of a prostitute Fryling frequented decided to rob the millionaire client. 

Rumors say, detectives solved the high profile case right away back in the 90s, but intentionally left it publicly unsolved to prevent embarrassment to the influential family. 

Detective JC was quoted in 1995 as saying quote ""After two years,

nothing has surfaced to show anybody was mad at him.” End quote.

However, in Pietro’s 2004 appeal, the state of Michigan refers to interviews with Christine from 1993 about their plan to rob the home, as well as statements that seem to directly implicate they were involved in the murder. 

A commenter on facebook claims a woman connected with her to say she believed her father was involved in the disappearance of Deanie. They said the man was in the construction business and spent a lot of time at a hotel and bar in the 28th and East Paris area, possibly called the Spinnaker. His name may have been Rob. They say this tip was given to Silent Observer. 

The Spinnaker is a bar at the Hilton hotel at 28th and Patterson, which is not too far from the Fryling mansion near the corner of Kraft and Burton. However, it’s unclear if this person was referring to Fryling. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION**

The Cold Case team was disbanded in 2016. They believed there were several people living in West Michigan who knew what happened, but were unwilling to cooperate. They strongly believed a woman still living in the cascade area had knowledge of the disappearance. There were rumors the Cold Case Team had more information about what happened that could not be released to the public. According to a facebook comment, a Freedom of Information Act request could not be made because the case is still open.

**Facebook**

What you’re about to hear next, is all speculation I found on the WZZM 13 Investigates Facebook page for Deanie. 

It’s alleged that four high school girls were involved in the altercation with Deanie at the middle school. S, LM., LL, and DD. who is GD’s sister. 

**S**

S still lives in the area. She failed a lie detector test. Some rumors say she was in the car when BB ran over Deanie. S was not BB’s girlfriend at the time, a girl named Patty was. S has an Aunt S, who knows NB, BB’s mother.

S’s husband is the nephew of Detective JC. S allegedly called JC ‘uncle’ growing up. 

KK claimed that in 1981 three KCSD detectives, JC, CB, and JP searched a pond off Grand River Drive without him and never filed a report for the search. KK said Jack wanted to solve the case by himself without KK’s help. 

**KB**

KB is BB’s cousin and went to church with S and Aunt S. She says BB was not involved. He had no motive, and detectives tracked him for years to no avail.  It’s a small town and there are going to be connections between people. BB never owned any trucks as suspected by some, and the car he owned at the time was never in any accidents. He only got rid of the car because a cousin had used it in a B&amp;E. KB says Bruce did not have a crush on S. KB posted on facebook that S lives on the same property she grew up on which is near all her relatives, and says S, DD, and the L’s are still close friends. 

Below that post is a picture of some snow and sticks which says it is the Golf course down from Snow road and says quote “I know what it is and so do you.” This is likely the Snow Ave that was searched in 2020 by KK, the Michigan Paranormal Alliance, and Michigan SAR with canine handlers. They saw no change in the dogs.

KB goes on to say the picture is a 3x5 foot perfectly rectangular hole that has been untouched for 33 years, and says this was a party spot back in the day. They continue to say that Deanie is ‘of course’ not there, so I don’t know what KB believes the spot to be. 

BB and GD worked together at Metric Manufacturing in Lowell. This was confirmed by GT the V.P. of Metric according to KB. BB and GD were not friends and GT remembered BB being there in 82 or 83 before marrying Beth, but was unsure about 1981. It’s alleged that GT and GD were both upper management and are close friends. KB claims GT may have protected GD by not mentioning in 1981 that GD and BB worked together and by claiming to not have employment records from 1981. It’s also possible that GD had a previous relationship with one of the girls from the altercation. 

**FJ**

One facebook commenter, FJ, has a few bold blaims. Someone told him that he was with BB while moving the body. He says the local police are involved and corrupt. A human skull was found in the Detroit River, FJ wondered if it could be Deanie. They go on to suspect the Detroit case is being kept quiet. FJ continues to say that a man named KH. changed his name. He was the GD with the beagle in the photo on the front page of the Grand Rapids Press.Apparently KH was friends with BB and is the one who threw the skull into the Detroit River. A man named Eric M. is also involved. FJ claims to run “the knights page” and has access to information from KH. FJ also accuses Deanie’s sister of lying about random bits of her past, so he may be a terrible source of information. 

**MISC INFO**

Here are some miscellaneous details and theories about Deanie’s case. 

**TUNNELS**

There are reportedly tunnels under one wing of Central Middle School for heating access. 

**PRETTY COMMENTS**

The woman claiming to have seen Deanie with another girl mentioned on facebook that Deanie was particularly noticeable because she was pretty. AD made a similar comment, as well as several of Deanie’s classmates.

**BOX TRUCK**

A woman named J asked on facebook if anyone can recall a short box side step brown truck on the night of the disappearance, but there were no responses. 

**DK.**

Another person on facebook mentions DK. as a name possibly involved.

**CONSTRUCTION WORKERS**

A facebook thread was deleted over comments that Deanie may have flirted with construction workers and bummed cigarettes from them. There was some construction going on at the school at the time. 

**MISC THEORIES**

**PARTY**

One story is that Deanie ended up at a party on Cascade road. From there, one girl and three men took Deanie away, potentially to the old schoolhouse, and killed her there. I’m not sure this adds up, because the night Deanie disappeared, she was supposed to babysit for the Hart family. She had babysat in the past for A as well.

**ZAK**

Killer EZ, called Zak, was rumored to be romantically involved with Deanie since he attended the same school. This is unlikely as he did not live in Michigan at the time.

**RA**

Serial Killer RA is not believed to be involved.  

**JANE DOES**

Here are some potential Jane Doe’s.

Vidor Jane Doe was white, between ages 12 and 20, between 4 foot 6 and 5 foot 6. She was found in Vidor, Texas in 1984, believed to be around a year after her death in 1983. Sketches of Vidor look similar to Deanie.

Jane Doe 1985 from missingkids.org  was found in Jellico, Tennessee in 1985. She is estimated to be 10-14 years old and is believed to have passed away between 1981 and 1984. She had several silver fillings. Jellico is a straight shot down I-75 from Grand Rapids, and again the sketches look similar to Deanie. 

I-96 Jane was identified and is not Deanie. 

**JF**

A man on facebook named T posted information he claims came from a man named BP. BP worked with JF at JF Sign Co. and heard James tell KF not to worry about taking a lie detector test, that “she” passed hers by thinking of something else. A jealous girl was involved and a woman named Kathy said she spent time with KF and his mother on Kettle Lake back in the Day, and that KF considered Deanie his girlfriend. BP says he asked KF directly about Deanie in the early 2000’s, and with a trembling voice he said ‘I’m not the one that hurt that girl, BP.’ “ 

The same BP left a comment asking to put pressure on JF. He also says he thinks JF murdered KF. 

EF commented that she  was there when her father, KF, died and says the death was an accidental overdose. She says she never heard the name BB from her father and defended her father saying he ‘would never hurt a soul’ and never even hunted or fished.

On July 2nd, 2021, 40 years after Deanie Peters disappeared, JF was arrested for perjury in connection to her case. This is the first arrest investigators have made. There is no evidence connecting JF to the disappearance, however the assistant prosecutor is using investigative subpoenas to force witnesses to testify.

JF reportedly changed his story about SO, who he has known since childhood. JF testified that he never thought SOe had killed Deanie. However, he told detectives back in 2008 there were rumors about SO strangling and raping women. JF told detectives quote “SO might have been the one who did it.”end quote. SOe denied these claims. 

JF also denied telling anyone about the potential involvement of KF. KF worked off and on at JF’s sign shop in Caledonia. KF was Deanie’s boyfriend at one time, and according to his ex wife, he had a photo with a detailed love letter written on the back and signed by Deanie. ST, KF’s girlfriend from about 1999 to 2004, told the court that JF called her the day KF died in 2008 and told her, ‘Yeah, I think he (meaning KF) lived his life with drugs and alcohol because he felt guilty about killing Deanie Peters.” 

JF’s attorney argued that JF simply did not remember things clearly and did not knowingly lie. The judge said evidence showed JF had a “lengthy pattern” of false statements to investigators.

JF’s phone showed six calls and 201 texts between JF and SOe from May 24, 2021, to June 24, 2021. One call was one day before JF’s testimony and lasted eight minutes. Another call on June 1 waszz shortly after JF learned investigators were again interviewing witnesses in the case.That call lasted just over an hour and had been deleted from SO’s phone and did not appear on JF’s phone at all. During a call while JF was in jail, his son told him “SO ratted you out.” JF responded with, “How do you know?”

Court documents also allege that JF told other witnesses not to bring their cellphones when they appeared under subpoenas.

JF told investigators in 2002 that he was told by a friend that two other men were in a car in 1981 when Deanie Peters ran out from between parked cars and they struck and killed her, and that she was buried “in a shallow grave with her head toward the river.”

**WZZM**

The person maintaining the WZZM 13 Investigates facebook page retired on December 23rd, 2021. It’s unclear if the page will be maintained. 

WZZM interviewed several key people in this case, including KK, A, M, and RA, who was the last known person to speak to Deanie on her way to the bathroom. However, the web page hosting these interviews has been taken down. Several of my source articles from Episode 1 were also removed. I tried contacting the station to see if they were still available but received no response. 

Investigation Discovery was reportedly going to pick up the case, but it was dropped when producers changed. 

John Walsh picked up Deanie as a February Missing Child. 

**ENDING**

Deanie is remembered as being bubbly and encouraging. Although she wanted to be a model, M believed Deanie would have been a veterinarian. Deanie had a short article published about her eighth grade trip to camp. She says of her peers, quote “They learned the importance of simply trying, trusting their friends, and overcoming their fears.” end quote. 

KK reportedly kept Deanie’s photo in his wallet until he passed away. Students at FHC still write papers about Deanie. William said of his sister's unknown killer, “I think it’s almost worse than prison, because they’ve had to live with it their whole lives.” 

Deanie was declared legally dead in 1991. Her father D passed away in 2017. M and J have moved to Arizona, where they still have a bedroom for Deanie recreated exactly the way she left it. They desperately want to lay Deanie to rest. 

The investigation is open and active as of 2021.

The statute of limitations has expired on all charges except murder. There is a $25,000 cash reward for any credible information about what happened or Deanie’s remains. You can contact CrimeStoppers to remain completely anonymous at 1800 Speak Up, or the Kent County Sheriff’s Department at 616-632-6100.

&amp;#x200B;

This is an update on Episode 1, Deanie Peters, which had its first major break since 1981. This episode will not only cover the arrest of James Frisbie, but will include additional and clarifying information mostly from the WZZM13 Investigates Facebook page. I will be covering all of the original information again in this episode. 

**INTRO**

The year is 1981. Ronald Reagan takes office, the first test tube baby is born, and MTV hits the airwaves.

That’s how long ago Deanie Peters disappeared. 

**THE DISAPPEARANCE**

Deanie was a 14 year old eighth grader attending her 6 year old brother William’s wrestling practice with her mom, Mary. Mary’s good friend Ariadyne saw Deanie coming down the stairs at about 4:45 p.m as she arrived to pick up her son Paul, who had ridden to wrestling practice with the Peters family. Deanie waved to Ariadyne and said she was going to the restroom and would be right back. 

That’s where this forty year old mystery begins.

The disappearance took place on February 5th 1981, at Forest Hill Central Middle School, which is in one of if not the safest neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I previously said elementary school, but that was not accurate. Even today people let their kids wander on bikes throughout the suburb. It’s a desirable area. This area is referred to in the news by many names, the general area of the city is called Forest Hills. Cascade is a primary street running through Forest Hills. The middle school is not far from Cascade.

The day of the disappearance, campus was busy. One facebook comment says they were there that day, and whatever happened must have been quick with all the activity.

There were about 75 people in total in the two level gym. The upper level held the wrestling meet. Photos of the wrestling team cannot be found in yearbooks because it was not a Forest Hills Public School System event. Their wrestling program wasn’t large enough, so children from any district were allowed to join. Matches were random rather than by school. 

The lower level of the gym had an aerobics class taking place.

The highschool, which shares a campus with the middle school, had a ‘donkey basketball game’ about two hours after the disappearance, which is where you actually dress up as donkeys and play basketball. There is no solid record of who participated in the game. 

**THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION**

**RUNAWAY**

Initially when Deanie did not return, not too much alarm was raised. It was thought she might have stopped to view another school event. The school was thoroughly searched. 

Police were called at 6:42p.m. This would have been roughly when the donkey basketball game was beginning at the high school. Police, though, thought Deanie might have run away to go live with her father and four siblings in California, despite her leaving pretty much everything behind including her savings. The lead detective assigned to the case, Ken Kleinheksel, had spent 5 years tracing runaway children. A classmate of Deanie’s said back in 1981 that Deanie did spend the night at a friend's house after arguing with her parents on more than one occasion. 

**NOT A RUNAWAY**

After 24 hours without contact from Deanie, search efforts intensified. Volunteers scoured nearby areas. Searches were conducted by helicopter and horseback. Parents waiting in the parking lot said they did not see Deanie, or anything out of the ordinary. Children from the school were interviewed in groups. Some children had not been aware anyone had disappeared until the following day. The community tied ribbons around trees and organized searches. 

After two weeks, no evidence had been found. A drawing of a possible suspect was made but never released to the public. 

**HYPNOSIS SIGHTING**

A woman on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class that day and says she saw Deanie and another girl walk across the gym heading to the girls room. This may be the same person who told investigators under hypnosis that they saw Deanie at 5:10p.m. walking inside the school with another girl, who had dark, shoulder length hair. This girl has yet to be identified. 

Rumors about the school incinerator were dispelled. Deanie’s stepfather John, and the school custodian Arthur Diaz were ruled out as suspects. 

**ARTHUR DIAZ**

Arthur was approached by Mary and John at the school, and offered his condolences. He said he told them the same thing he told investigators; That three high school aged boys, one in a green and white Forest Hills Central letter jacket, banged on the locked doors of the school to be let in during the practice. Arthur did not recognize the boys as students, and refused. Mary said she does not remember this conversation. Arthur passed away in 2013. 

**MAN WATCHING AEROBICS**

A tip was received about a man standing in the doorway watching the aerobics class. Police found this man, who said he was waiting for his girlfriend, a part time music teacher at the school. Police could not connect him to Deanie. Witnesses disagree on if this was actually the man seen that night. One person on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class and not have seen any unusual man, suggesting he may have looked like he fit in. 

**PHONE CALLS**

Two odd phone calls were received by friends of Deanie’s, three days apart. One was around 8:30p.m.on a Wednesday to a close family friend. There was only a whimpering sound. When asked if it was Deanie, the caller hung up.

The second call was on February 28th to Guy. Guy was the nickname of Deanie’s boyfriend, Larry, who she mentioned in a letter to her dad. He was 17 at the time of dating Deanie, but told the papers he was 15 to avoid looking bad. The call was long-distance, from a girl who called herself “Beth”. Guy wasn’t home to take the call and his mother declined to accept the charges. 

A close friend of Deanie’s also claims to have received several hang up calls, primarily late at night. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION**

In 2008 the Kent County Metro Cold Case Team was formed thanks to efforts by Ariadyne. Some people asked how Ariadyne is connected to this case. She’s the last person left in Grand Rapids to push the case. Deanie’s family ultimately moved away from the area.  

Over 400 interviews were conducted, 7 states visited, and up to 15 possible burial sites were searched. These include a Young Marines camp in Keene township, an area in Montcalm County, an area near Whitneyville and 92nd Ave, a shallow pond along Grand River Drive, and a mound of rocks. 

An age progression of Deanie is available in our source material.

Initially it was believed no one saw Deanie on her way to the restroom. However, a student may have said hello to her as she walked toward the bathroom. Deanie may have also been seen walking near the back door of the school with another girl. Someone reportedly saw a girl matching Deanie’s description willingly get into a car in the middle school parking lot. 

The disappearance was reconstructed. Efforts were focused on James Frisbie, Kyle Fate, and Steve Osborn. All three graduated from Caledonia High School. 

**JOE &amp; JEFF F.** 

One woman claimed while canoeing in 1989, a man named Joe F. talked about how he and two others hit a girl named Deanie with their car in a school parking lot. They put her in the trunk, and buried her along the Flat River. The two other men are rumored to be Jeff F. of the same last name and Dean M. According to rumors all three were friends of a man named Bruce Bunch. One person believes Jeff F and someone named Greg P  were involved, and mentions a long winding road that takes you to a property by a forest with a pond owned by one of the two men, who travelled often for work in a truck. Jeff F. allegedly has a violent history and a history with law enforcement. Jeff F. was married to Margo. Margo’s brother allegedly knew Deanie. 

This person also says that after Brent’s interview with Mary, Mary could no longer find Deanie’s horse collection from her bedroom. I’m not sure, but they may be referring to Brent Ashcroft who covered Deanie’s story with WZZM 13. 

**BRUCE BUNCH**

Joe F. told detectives in the early 90s that he heard Bruce Bunch talk about killing Deanie while drunk and crying at a kegger near the sod farms off Grand River Drive near Lowell, and that she was buried near the old one room schoolhouse. This tip was investigated with no luck. 

Bunch may have been married to Joseph F.’s relative, Beth. Beth is the same name as the girl who called Guy collect in the weeks after the disappearance, it’s unknown if that is connected. 

Investigators were never able to rule Bunch out as a suspect. He was 17 and living in Lowell at the time. The common rumor is that Bunch saw Deanie and drove his car at her to scare her, hit a patch of ice, and accidentally ran over and killed her. It’s thought Deanie may have left the school to smoke a cigarette.

Bunch reportedly confessed to the killing to somewhere between 20 and 30 people who did not believe him. 

His first wife called Bunch violent and abusive, and said he would sometimes black out after drinking with no memory. She claims he once pushed her out of a moving vehicle and broke her ankle, and another time threatened to run her off the road. 

In a phone interview, Bunch said he had a dream about Deanie after seeing her story on TV, but said he had never actually met her. He couldn't remember details about the dream, only that he told friends about it, and it somehow snowballed into how he had killed Deanie, maybe hit her with his car or truck, and buried her. 

A facebook comment claims Bunch had to leave to Somerset after being harassed by police and possibly refused to come back even for a family funeral. 

Here’s a quote from Bunch, back when he owned a repair shop: quote ""When I was a kid, I used to have this mental telepathy thing. I could tell things, like when a bird comes into your house and tells you someone's going to die. Everybody just keeps carrying it different ways."" end quote.

I looked up the bird comment, and a bird flying into a closed window is considered to be a bad omen, typically that someone will die. I believe Bunch was saying he had a sense for bad omens. 

Bunch died of a heart attack in 2008 before being questioned by the Cold Case Team. I previously said Bunch had never been interviewed in regards to Deanie, that was not accurate. Ken Kleinheksel received a tip about Bunch a few weeks after the disappearance, and interviewed Bunch two or three months after the disappearance. Bunch said he had nothing to do with it, and they had nothing to hold him. 

**THE ALTERCATION**

It was discovered that two days before her disappearance, Deanie had an altercation with at least two other girls over a boy, possibly Bruce Bunch, where they told her to stay away from him. It may or may not have been physical. Those involved were identified and interviewed by police. 

**THE DIARY**

In 2008, Ken was subpoenaed for the return of Deanie’s Diary. After retirement, Ken had focused his efforts on solving Deanie’s case, along with Ariadyne. He says the diary was returned to Mary, but Mary does not recall receiving it. Ken also says he read the diary very closely and there was nothing useful in it. However, that comment was made before Ken learned of the confrontation Deanie had in the days before her death. 

Ken alleged that several witnesses claim they gave statements, and that information was never passed on to him. Detectives repeatedly took statements, but did not file reports. 

**CORRUPTION**

**ARTHUR DIAZ**

Sgt. Chet Bush says he was unable to track all potential leads in Deanie’s case. This includes being unable to fly to Arizona to interview Deanie’s mother and stepfather, and being unable to interview the school custodian Arthur Diaz. However, the press found Arthur living about a mile from the Sheriff's department, where he had lived for the past 15 years. 

Arthur Diaz believed the police targeted him for being hispanic. He was locked in a cell overnight and made to testify in front of a grand jury about a month after the disappearance. His only criminal record at the time was for drinking and driving. He stated he was cleaning a school office the night of the disappearance and never saw Deanie. Arthur said he was never asked to give a description or look at mugshots regarding the three boys he refused to let in the building.

**FRYLING**

Sgt. Chet Bush also claimed to have faced roadblocks in the investigation of the 1993 murder of millionaire Robert Fryling. There is essentially nothing online about the case, I had to reach out to the local library to get details. 

Robert Fryling was the well connected and influential owner of Fryling Construction in the 90s. His stepdaughter Maria married Doug DeVos, son of Amway’s Rich DeVos Sr.  Robert had a reputation as a loving husband and family man, when he was suddenly murdered in his 6,400 square foot home. 

The Fryling case went unsolved for eight years until Pietro Terrel and Christine VanMeter were arrested in 2001 with the help of a retired FBI agent, who was reportedly paid the equivalent of $54,000 per year as a cold case investigator. Officials said in 2001 that the same investigator would be looking into Deanie's case. 

It came out that the pimp of a prostitute Fryling frequented decided to rob the millionaire client. 

Rumors say, detectives solved the high profile case right away back in the 90s, but intentionally left it publicly unsolved to prevent embarrassment to the influential family. 

Detective Jack Christensen was quoted in 1995 as saying quote ""After two years,

nothing has surfaced to show anybody was mad at him.” End quote.

However, in Pietro’s 2004 appeal, the state of Michigan refers to interviews with Christine from 1993 about their plan to rob the home, as well as statements that seem to directly implicate they were involved in the murder. 

A commenter on facebook claims a woman connected with her to say she believed her father was involved in the disappearance of Deanie. They said the man was in the construction business and spent a lot of time at a hotel and bar in the 28th and East Paris area, possibly called the Spinnaker. His name may have been Rob. They say this tip was given to Silent Observer. 

The Spinnaker is a bar at the Hilton hotel at 28th and Patterson, which is not too far from the Fryling mansion near the corner of Kraft and Burton. However, it’s unclear if this person was referring to Fryling. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION**

The Cold Case team was disbanded in 2016. They believed there were several people living in West Michigan who knew what happened, but were unwilling to cooperate. They strongly believed a woman still living in the cascade area had knowledge of the disappearance. There were rumors the Cold Case Team had more information about what happened that could not be released to the public. According to a facebook comment, a Freedom of Information Act request could not be made because the case is still open.

**Facebook**

What you’re about to hear next, is all speculation I found on the WZZM 13 Investigates Facebook page for Deanie. 

It’s alleged that four high school girls were involved in the altercation with Deanie at the middle school. Sue, Lori M., Lori L, and Debbie D. who is Guy’s sister. 

**SUE**

Sue still lives in the area. She failed a lie detector test. Some rumors say she was in the car when Bunch ran over Deanie. Sue was not Bunch’s girlfriend at the time, a girl named Patty was. Sue has an Aunt Sandy, who knows Naomi Bunch, Bruce’s mother.

Sue’s husband is the nephew of Detective Jack Christensen. Sue allegedly called Jack ‘uncle’ growing up. 

Ken claimed that in 1981 three KCSD detectives, Jack Christensen, Chet Bush, and Jim Porter, searched a pond off Grand River Drive without him and never filed a report for the search. Ken said Jack wanted to solve the case by himself without Ken’s help. 

**KIRBY**

Kirby is Bruce Bunch’s cousin and went to church with Sue and Sandy. She says Bunch was not involved. He had no motive, and detectives tracked him for years to no avail.  It’s a small town and there are going to be connections between people. Bunch never owned any trucks as suspected by some, and the car he owned at the time was never in any accidents. He only got rid of the car because a cousin had used it in a B&amp;E. Kirby says Bruce did not have a crush on Sue. Kirby posted on facebook that Sue lives on the same property she grew up on which is near all her relatives, and says Sue, Deb, and the Lori’s are still close friends. 

Below that post is a picture of some snow and sticks which says it is the Golf course down from Snow road and says quote “I know what it is and so do you.” This is likely the Snow Ave that was searched in 2020 by Ken, the Michigan Paranormal Alliance, and Michigan SAR with canine handlers. They saw no change in the dogs.

Kirby goes on to say the picture is a 3x5 foot perfectly rectangular hole that has been untouched for 33 years, and says this was a party spot back in the day. They continue to say that Deanie is ‘of course’ not there, so I don’t know what Kirby believes the spot to be. 

Bunch and Guy worked together at Metric Manufacturing in Lowell. This was confirmed by Greg Thomas the V.P. of Metric according to Kirby. Bunch and Guy were not friends and Greg remembered Bunch being there in 82 or 83 before marrying Beth, but was unsure about 1981. It’s alleged that Thomas and Guy Dalke were both upper management and are close friends. Kirby claims Thomas may have protected Guy by not mentioning in 1981 that Guy and Bunch worked together and by claiming to not have employment records from 1981. It’s also possible that Guy had a previous relationship with one of the girls from the altercation. 

**FACEBOOK JOE**

One facebook commenter, Facebook Joe, has a few bold blaims. Someone told him that he was with Bunch while moving the body. He says the local police are involved and corrupt. A human skull was found in the Detroit River, Facebook Joe wondered if it could be Deanie. They go on to suspect the Detroit case is being kept quiet. Facebook Joe continues to say that a man named Ken H. changed his name. He was the guy with the beagle in the photo on the front page of the Grand Rapids Press.Apparently Ken H. was friends with Bunch and is the one who threw the skull into the Detroit River. A man named Eric M. is also involved. Facebook Joe claims to run “the knights page” and has access to information from Ken. Facebook Joe also accuses Deanie’s sister of lying about random bits of her past, so he may be a terrible source of information. 

**MISC INFO**

Here are some miscellaneous details and theories about Deanie’s case. 

**TUNNELS**

There are reportedly tunnels under one wing of Central Middle School for heating access. 

**PRETTY COMMENTS**

The woman claiming to have seen Deanie with another girl mentioned on facebook that Deanie was particularly noticeable because she was pretty. Arthur Diaz made a similar comment, as well as several of Deanie’s classmates.

**BOX TRUCK**

A woman named Jennifer asked on facebook if anyone can recall a short box side step brown truck on the night of the disappearance, but there were no responses. 

**DONNY K.**

Another person on facebook mentions Donny K. as a name possibly involved.

**CONSTRUCTION WORKERS**

A facebook thread was deleted over comments that Deanie may have flirted with construction workers and bummed cigarettes from them. THere was some construction going on at the school at the time. 

**MISC THEORIES**

**PARTY**

One story is that Deanie ended up at a party on Cascade road. From there, one girl and three men took Deanie away, potentially to the old schoolhouse, and killed her there. I’m not sure this adds up, because the night Deanie disappeared, she was supposed to babysit for the Hart family. She had babysat in the past for Ariadyne as well.

**ZAK**

Killer Edward Zakrzewski, called Zak, was rumored to be romantically involved with Deanie since he attended the same school. This is unlikely as he did not live in Michigan at the time.

**ANDREWS**

Serial Killer Ralph Andrews is not believed to be involved.  

**JANE DOES**

Here are some potential Jane Doe’s.

Vidor Jane Doe was white, between ages 12 and 20, between 4 foot 6 and 5 foot 6. She was found in Vidor, Texas in 1984, believed to be around a year after her death in 1983. Sketches of Vidor look similar to Deanie.

Jane Doe 1985 from missingkids.org  was found in Jellico, Tennessee in 1985. She is estimated to be 10-14 years old and is believed to have passed away between 1981 and 1984. She had several silver fillings. Jellico is a straight shot down I-75 from Grand Rapids, and again the sketches look similar to Deanie. 

I-96 Jane was identified and is not Deanie. 

**JAMES FRISBIE**

A man on facebook named Tyler posted information he claims came from a man named Bob P. Bob worked with James Frisbie at Frisbie Sign Co. and heard James tell Kyle Fate not to worry about taking a lie detector test, that “she” passed hers by thinking of something else. A jealous girl was involved and a woman named Kathy said she spent time with Kyle and his mother on Kettle Lake back in the Day, and that Kyle considered Deanie his girlfriend. Bob says he asked Kyle directly about Deanie in the early 2000’s, and with a trembling voice he said ‘I’m not the one that hurt that girl, Bob.’ “ 

The same Bob P. left a comment asking to put pressure on James Frisbie. He also says he thinks James Frisbie murdered Kyle Fate. 

Emily Fate commented that she  was there when her father, Kyle, died and says the death was an accidental overdose. She says she never heard the name Bruce Bunch from her father and defended her father saying he ‘would never hurt a soul’ and never even hunted or fished.

On July 2nd, 2021, 40 years after Deanie Peters disappeared, James Frisbie was arrested for perjury in connection to her case. This is the first arrest investigators have made. There is no evidence connecting Frisbie to the disappearance, however the assistant prosecutor is using investigative subpoenas to force witnesses to testify.

Frisbie reportedly changed his story about Steve Osborne, who he has known since childhood. Frisbie testified that he never thought Osborne had killed Deanie. However, he told detectives back in 2008 there were rumors about Osborn strangling and raping women. Frisbie told detectives quote “Steve might have been the one who did it.”end quote. Osborne denied these claims. 

Frisbie also denied telling anyone about the potential involvement of Kyle Fate. Fate worked off and on at Frisbie’s sign shop in Caledonia. Fate was Deanie’s boyfriend at one time, and according to his ex wife, he had a photo with a detailed love letter written on the back and signed by Deanie. Susan Timmer, Fate’s girlfriend from about 1999 to 2004, told the court that Frisbie called her the day Fate died in 2008 and told her, ‘Yeah, I think he (meaning Fate) lived his life with drugs and alcohol because he felt guilty about killing Deanie Peters.” 

Frisbie’s attorney argued that Frisbie simply did not remember things clearly and did not knowingly lie. The judge said evidence showed Frisbie had a “lengthy pattern” of false statements to investigators.

Frisbie’s phone showed six calls and 201 texts between Frisbie and Osborne from May 24, 2021, to June 24, 2021. One call was one day before Frisbie’s testimony and lasted eight minutes. Another call on June 1 waszz shortly after Frisbie learned investigators were again interviewing witnesses in the case.That call lasted just over an hour and had been deleted from Steve Osborne’s phone and did not appear on Frisbie’s phone at all. During a call while Frisbie was in jail, his son told him “Steve ratted you out.” Frisbie responded with, “How do you know?”

Court documents also allege that Frisbie told other witnesses not to bring their cellphones when they appeared under subpoenas.

Frisbie told investigators in 2002 that he was told by a friend that two other men were in a car in 1981 when Deanie Peters ran out from between parked cars and they struck and killed her, and that she was buried “in a shallow grave with her head toward the river.”

**WZZM**

The person maintaining the WZZM 13 Investigates facebook page retired on December 23rd, 2021. It’s unclear if the page will be maintained. 

WZZM interviewed several key people in this case, including Ken, Ariadyne, Mary, and Robert Alexander, who was the last known person to speak to Deanie on her way to the bathroom. However, the web page hosting these interviews has been taken down. Several of my source articles from Episode 1 were also removed. I tried contacting the station to see if they were still available but received no response. 

Investigation Discovery was reportedly going to pick up the case, but it was dropped when producers changed. 

John Walsh picked up Deanie as a February Missing Child. 

**ENDING**

Deanie is remembered as being bubbly and encouraging. Although she wanted to be a model, Mary believed Deanie would have been a veterinarian. Deanie had a short article published about her eighth grade trip to camp. She says of her peers, quote “They learned the importance of simply trying, trusting their friends, and overcoming their fears.” end quote. 

Ken Klienheksel reportedly kept Deanie’s photo in his wallet until he passed away. Students at FHC still write papers about Deanie. William said of his sister's unknown killer, “I think it’s almost worse than prison, because they’ve had to live with it their whole lives.” 

Deanie was declared legally dead in 1991. Her father Duane passed away in 2017. Mary and John have moved to Arizona, where they still have a bedroom for Deanie recreated exactly the way she left it. They desperately want to lay Deanie to rest. 

The investigation is open and active as of 2021.

The statute of limitations has expired on all charges except murder. There is a $25,000 cash reward for any credible information about what happened or Deanie’s remains. You can contact CrimeStoppers to remain completely anonymous at 1800 Speak Up, or the Kent County Sheriff’s Department at 616-632-6100.

Are there killers who hadn't killed innocent people and instead focused on

 bad guys like abusers other killers murderers 

Killed their abusers.

I watched dexter and I'm curious if this type of killer is possible cause he is clearly a sociopath. One of the driving factors of his narrative is his inability to feel normal, human emotions. He does care for people, but on a distant level. Heck, several times in the novel he refers to himself as a sociopath. 

For example gypsy rose killed her abuser technically gypsy Rose Blanchard's mother, Dee Dee, falsely claimed her daughter was suffering from different illnesses until Gypsy arranged for her boyfriend to kill her mother in 2015.


Aileen Wuornos

Peter Sutcliffe, the serial killer known as the Yorkshire Ripper, is expected to die any moment, I think about monsters like him, and how his murderous reign of terror left its stamp not just on the victims and their loved ones, but on women everywhere.

There are monsters, though, and there are misrepresentations. Can we even begin to compare a man who rapes, murders and defiles the bodies of his female victims to Aileen Wuornos, a woman who perfectly fit the profile of a victim of a serial killer such as Sutcliffe —  but who, instead, has been represented as his female counterpart? They even made a film about her: Monster.

She was found naked in parking lot P3 in Gatineau Park, north of the intersection of Prom. de la Gatineau and Gamelin Street, at 5:40 am by a man walking his dog. She was still alive, but died in the hospital later that morning from stab wounds. Police say that she fought for her and her baby's life 'vigorously', so much so that they believe her killer may have been wounded. [Here is a very good poster with her information, maps, and a summary.](https://i0.wp.com/www.mollymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kelly-morriseau-map-molly-matters.jpg)

She had been living in Vanier, an area in Ottawa, Canada and was last seen leaving a Montfort Street apartment in the area at 4 am. Police say she was with a man, and was seen getting into his car, possibly a 1985 to 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera or Calais. The police believe the suspect could have been seen in the area in the days leading up to the murder, looking for prostitutes. The police released [a sketch](https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2021/12/10/morrisseau-composite-suspect-1-5702593-1639162807998.jpeg) of this man in 2007. On [this map](http://www.worldeasyguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Map-of-Gatineau.jpg) you can see Vanier (eastern side of Ottawa) and Gatineau. [Here is a close-up map](http://ncc-website-2.s3.amazonaws.com/images/GP-Parkways_nightly-closures-map.jpg?mtime=20190415163225) of the park, where you can see P3 in the lower right quadrant. Ottawa is in eastern Ontario, Canada, and borders Gatineau, western Quebec.

Authorities tracked the suspect's movements and believe he used a lane reserved for emergency vehicles between Prom. de la Gatineau and Boul. Saint-Raymond. Some items belonging to her were found on Rue des Frenes, near Boul. du Plateau, and behind Starcite Cinema, at 115 Boul. du Plateau. Additional items were recovered from a nearby brook. Police believe the suspect drove around the area and likely stepped out of his vehicle multiple times during that time.

Morrisseau was originally from Sagkeeng First Nations in Manitoba. She had 3 children and was 7 months pregnant at the time of her murder. Before she was killed, she was trying to turn her life around so she could be reunited with her children, who'd been taken by the province's child services in October 2005 (\~a year earlier). An acquaintance had introduced Morrisseau to crack cocaine, forcing her into prostitution, and her life had spiraled into drugs/alcohol. Evidence suggests she may have exchanged money with the suspect and that he may have solicited other women before/after the murder.

The suspect is described as a white male aged 24-30 with an athletic build. He would now be 40-46 years old. He had short, blond, curly hair. He was 5'8 - 5'10 and weighs 180-200 lbs. He speaks English and French without an accent. To me, this suggests a fully bilingual person, but this is not uncommon in Northern and Eastern Ontario, some of Manitoba and New Brunswick, and parts of Quebec.

This is the first of some posts I'll be sharing on francophone disappearances/murders in Canada (possibly other francophone countries as well).

ANDOVER — It has been nearly a decade since Holly Senykoff and John Magee’s parents, John and Geraldine Magee, were found murdered in their Andover home.

As the anniversary nears, Senykoff and Magee are once again asking for assistance from anyone who might recall even the smallest detail to help solve the case.

“It’s been almost 10 years since the tragic deaths of Jack and Jeri Magee. Our family has lost 10 years of love, smiles, wisdom, support and happiness with them. For the past decade, we have hoped and prayed for answers and closure to this horrible crime,” Senykoff and Magee said in a statement through Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett’s office.

“We hope that the 10-year commemoration of this terrible event will encourage those who have information on this crime to come forward. The time is now and this injustice should not continue. We support the authorities in their investigation, and hope that they will be able to bring this case to a clear conclusion soon,” they stated.

“Jack and Jeri will live forever in our hearts and memories,” they continued. “But the people who committed this act are still at large, and they need to be brought to justice. We ask that anyone who has any knowledge of what happened to Jack and Jeri immediately come forward to the Andover Police Department. Please help us solve this crime.”

Over the past decade law enforcement from the Andover Police Department, Massachusetts State Police and FBI have chased down leads to try and solve the mysterious double homicide, The Eagle-Tribune previously reported.

On the morning of Dec. 14, 2011, John “Jack” Magee, 69, and Geraldine “Jeri” Magee, 67, were both found shot dead in their home at 7 Orchard Crossing. Their bodies were discovered that morning by their daughter, Holly Senykoff, who was dropping off her children at the time.

In the initial police log entry for the incident, a police dispatcher noted “they are lying on the ground with blood coming out, she (the daughter) believes they are beyond any help.” In January 2012, two death certificates from the state’s Medical Examiner’s Office asserted that John died of gunshot wounds to the head, neck and chest, from one or possibly more assailants over a period of seconds. Geraldine was killed by a single shot to the head.

The day before the murders, John went to a construction site in Reading where his company was building several houses. While he was there, he spoke with his son John Magee III about picking up building materials in Boston and bringing them to the site the next day. Jack Magee reportedly left the construction site around 3 p.m.

Senykoff told police that on Dec. 13, she spoke to her mother around 4:25 p.m., regarding plans for the next day. Senykoff said her mother agreed to watch her grandchildren while Senykoff went shopping for Christmas presents. Senykoff also said she believed she could hear her father talking in the background and assumed that he was home with Geraldine.

John Magee III was at the Magee Construction office, in the basement of his parent’s Andover home, researching some information about the supplies he had to pick up in Boston. According to Blodgett, he left his parents’ home around 4:30 p.m., Dec. 13.

“At approximately 9:19 the next morning, Andover police received a 911 call from Holly reporting that she found her parents dead in their home,” Blodgett said during a press conference in 2015. “The investigation began immediately.”

On Dec. 13, 2011, the night before the murders, a black Lexus SUV owned by the Magees was found burning on Prince Street in Boston’s North End.

Police conducted dozens of interviews with family, friends and Magees’ employees in Massachusetts and Jupiter, Florida, where the Magees had a second home.

However, the murder has yet to be solved.

Anyone with any information is encouraged to contact the Massachusetts State Police detectives assigned to the District Attorney’s Office at 978-745-8908 or the Andover Police Anonymous Tip Line at 978-623-3560.

84,Shaperonova88,[],1642135545,"This piece of news is very exciting and I'm happy this was solved in our lifetime, the 1980 Arroyo Grande Jane Doe was identified in December 2021 as 17 year old Tammy Corrine Terrell of Roswell, New Mexico. Let's look more into this with a few excerpts from Fox 5 Vegas.

For decades, she was known only as ""Jane Arroyo Grande Doe."" Last week, Henderson police finally identified the teen whose body found 40 years ago on the side of the road, stabbed, beaten and nude. FOX5 spoke with the family who never stopped looking for Tammy Terrell of New Mexico. 

Terrell was one of four sisters who grew up in a foster home. Carla Klontz was the youngest and was 13 years old when her sister went missing.

“The police said she was 17 and had ran away a couple times and she was almost going to be 18, so they are not going to look for her. So, they didn’t,” Klontz said.

She looked everywhere she went for her sister for the next four decades.

“Her birthday is on the Fourth of July. You are wondering and you a missing her. It’s not a true celebration with her missing, and we would always look in crowds, look at homeless people in their faces to see if she is one of them,” Klontz said.

85,can_i_use_my_name,[],1642126312,"Ok, it's been two weeks now since this couple in their 30s of Bourne, Massachusetts mysteriously passed away due to ""medical reasons"" leaving behind a 1 year old and a 6 year old.  Law enforcement and the media has provided minimal information.  The father's family has made a few statements that were, I would say, not normal.  A video interview of his family had two women who had the demeanor as if they were deciding where to go for dinner.  No sense of grief, no ""I miss my brother"" talk.....just talk about raising money for the kids (it's up to over $120,000 right now!).  Same thing with the family's FB posts.  Very very generic and business-like.  There hasn't been a peep from the mom's side of the family.  Usually in cases like this the media at least announces who is caring for the kids....in this instance they haven't even said ""the children are with relatives"" statement.  The local media has not done any follow up stories since the initial death notification.  This is concerning because people have dumped over $120,000 into this family via GoFundMe.  All indications are there was some type of illegal, or at least immoral activity, going on and with this and the truth is being withheld.  

Here's a link from the local media on the case:  [https://www.capenews.net/bourne/news/community-raises-more-than-115-k-for-sagamore-family-rocked-by-double-tragedy/article\_4b155158-2b09-509f-adcb-7aa26485b39d.html](https://www.capenews.net/bourne/news/community-raises-more-than-115-k-for-sagamore-family-rocked-by-double-tragedy/article_4b155158-2b09-509f-adcb-7aa26485b39d.html)

When it was discovered in 2000 an Antarctic researcher had been poisoned, it was too late - seven months had passed since his death and his colleagues had long left the ice. 

The case came before a coroner's court in New Zealand, which determined that Marks had drunk methanol 'unknowingly' on the winter over stationing at Scott - Amundsen South Pole Base.

Having died long, dark season on the base - it was not until Spring that Marks could be returned to Christchurch for autopsy. Until then Australian scientist's death had been ascribed to 'natural causes'.

Due to the period of time between his death and the poisoning verdict, his international colleagues had left the country. They could not be recalled for questioning.

Only five of the fifty overwinter workers ever responded to questions from the coronial hearing.

It remains unresolved.

**Toast juice?**  
It was discovered that there was a culture of alcohol abuse and possibly other substances on the base.

Researchers had begun distilling hard spirits to drink. The home-made spirits were called 'toast juice', but analysis showed that there was low levels of methanol present. 

None of his colleagues suffered from methanol poisoning.  

**Polar politics**   
The case came to New Zealand's courts almost by accident. The US-operated base and run by contractors Raytheon, were not obliged to respond to the NZ court's requests.   
New Zealand has an historic claim to the area in which the incident took place, however - under the [Antarctic Treaty System](https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/avc/trty/193967.htm) \- the US Antarctic Program and National Science Foundation ""do not recognize the claims of other governments"" to Antarctica. 

It has been suggested that the lack of cooperation came from a lack of desire to acknowledge any other country's jurisdiction over the continent. Neither did New Zealand wish to rock the boat, as a host nation to several international Antarctic programmes - the US included.

There was very little appetite for an enquiry into the 'culture' on the base.

So, with these obstacles in the way, no definitive explanation for Marks' death was ever reached.

On the brisk October afternoon of 1973 , two Lebanon county game deputies were on patrol . They were patrolling the fort Indiantown (Pennsylvania) military game reserve , when they noticed a strange decaying odor driving down moonshine road. Poaching had been huge problem in that area, so they went to investigate.

Upon investigation , they found the decomposing nude remains of a young adult female women. She was covered in thick tree branches and a 48'' by 32.5"" sheet of green plastic. On the sheet there was a white seal that read "" National Sanitation Foundation, Testing Laboratory 8505 "". It was estimated that she had been dead for two week, was of Caucasian decent (white), she was 16 - 20 years old , had light auburn hair , and was around 5'7"" in height.

The cause of death has been determined to be homicidal , even though she had no bullet wounds, no bone fractures , no missing limbs , and was not set on fire . Isotope testing indicated she was from the southern united states . She had no clothes or Jewelry , nor where there any clothes or personal artifacts found near by.

The biggest evidence in this case was the white seal that read ""national sanitation foundation, testing laboratory 8505"". There is no direct laboratory with that name, but the National sanitation foundation does exist.

The national sanitation foundation was founded in 1944 , it was started to provide standards and practices to the food industry. It has since evolved into a international company with laboratories in Europe, south America , and Asia.

When researching this case , I found that there was a place called USGS located at ***8505*** *Research Way*,. *Middleton*, WI 5356 . Its a united states geological society office which is contracted with the National sanitation foundation to test ground water used in food processing.

Her body was fond near the indiantown Gap military base, a army staging area that was founded in 1941. It would train troops on how to preform overseas during WW2, the korean war, and other American backed peace-keeping conflicts. During the 1970's it served as the largest ROTC training camp in the country. Getting soldiers ready for the Vietnam war.

The National sanitation Foundation does have contracts with the US military to provide food sanitation services such as dishwashers and autoclaves. They also take samples of the ground water, that is used at the base. It is not know if there is/was a NSF testing laboratory at the base. The green tarp could have been samples that were about to be shipped out to a laboratory.

She might have been  a runaway , who got in touch with a solider station there during the Vietnam war. A couple of local runaways have been ruled out and her dna has no been matched to anyone in the DNA Doe database .

88,erobin37,[],1642112542,"On **July 6, 1981**, Theodore Frederick Kampf (46) left his Oaklyn, NJ residence for a long drive to Vancouver, BC to visit a friend. He was driving his recently purchased 1980 brick-brown Chevrolet pickup truck, mounted with a camper shell. It was the last time he was seen by his parents.

Theodore Kampf, known as Teddy, was the son of Theodore Sr. and Mary Kampf, who had lived in Oaklyn for 20 years. Teddy was an ex-serviceman who worked for several major electronics firms in the years before he went missing. His parents described him as ""a bit of an egghead"" and someone who ""never thought people were bad.""

His family received correspondence from him until **July 11**, five days after he departed. On **July 13**, he called his parents and said he was in Mount Vernon, Washington and going to cross the border into Canada. This was the last time anyone heard from him. At first, his parents were not concerned due to an going Canadian postal strike during the summer. 

Unbeknownst to Teddy's parents at the time, soon after some of Teddy’s traveler’s checks were cashed at a British Columbia bank. The checks had forged signatures, though the bank tellers who cashed the forged travelers' checks did not question the signatures and none could recall the person who presented the checks. A camera used to photograph customers at the bank was broken on the day before the person came in.

On **July 27**, Teddy’s truck was involved in a fender bender in Boise, Idaho. The driver identified himself as Teddy. The other driver, Christine Christenson, seeking insurance information, wrote Kampf's parents to say she'd been involved in a traffic accident with their son. When Teddy's parents phoned her, she provided a physical description of the truck driver - a tall, thin man in his 20s. Teddy was in his 40's and this obviously did not match his description.

In **August**, also unbeknownst to Teddy's parents, more of the traveler’s checks were cashed in North and South Dakota by someone other than Teddy.

In **October**, the family alerted the police. The police then found out about the use of forged checks as mentioned above. The FBI, who did not routinely work on missing persons cases, stepped in when the presence of the forged checks were known. ""We're not worried about the damn checks,"" Teddy's father complained. The Canadian authorities also stepped in, as the checks cashed in BC were indication that Teddy made it to Canada.

On **October 29**, Teddy's truck was found in a Flint Creek Pass, Montana ravine by a group of hunters, three months after Teddy initially disappeared. The Montana authorities only reported it to Oaklyn police on **February 22, 1982**.  By then, the truck had been handled by so many people it was useless as evidence.

Both Christine Christenson and the friend that Teddy was supposed to visit was questioned but there were no notable information presented in the media.

For almost 40 years, this case remained a cold case. Surprisingly, in 2021, his remains were identified. The remains were found on **May 21, 1983** though remained unidentified for quite some time. The body, then nicknamed ""Dawson City John Doe"", was found buried by a woodland brush several meters from the North Fork Dam and Dempster Highway, 40 km east of Dawson City, Yukon. The remains were buried in “an apparent attempt to conceal” the remains. Authorities did not disclose a cause of death. The case of this ""Dawson City John Doe"" was identified as a homicide. 

Authorities in Canada believe Teddy was killed shortly after arriving in Dawson City in July 1981. Investigators believe the person who drove Teddy ’s truck and left it in Montana has a connection to Montana, and possibly to mining. RCMP investigators said the Dawson City area is known for gold deposits and mining in the early 1980s, and the area Teddy’s truck was found is also known for mining. RCMP investigators are looking for information on anyone from Montana or the Granite County area who may have gone to Dawson City, possibly to mine in the Yukon or on the way to Alaska. 

Investigation remains open.

89,Bunnystrawbery,[],1642098578,"
In the spring of 1994, Cleashindra “Clea"" Hall was a bright 18-year-old girl with big plans. The Pine Bluff, Arkansas native was just two weeks away from graduating with honors at Watson Chapel High School. She had a summer internship lined up in Boston, and that fall she would’ve been heading off to Tennessee State University’s pre-med program, pursuing her dream of becoming a pediatrician. But that all changed on the evening of Monday, May 9, when after leaving her workplace at an office in town, Cleashindra Hall disappeared. 


 

That Monday was the family’s first day back to their normal routine following an exciting weekend; Clea’s prom had been that Friday, she attended a sorority ball on Saturday, and celebrated Mother’s Day on Sunday. Cleashindra had an afterschool job doing clerical work at the home office of Dr. Larry Amos, who wrote grants allocating resources for childcare facilities. Once  was done with helping out around his office, she would always call her mom to come pick her up. Only that evening, Cleshindra didn’t call. 

Laurell Hall, Cleashindra’s mother, waited for the house phone to ring that night and when it didn’t, her mother called Dr. Amos’ office. He said that Hall clocked out at 8:30 p.m. and was picked up by an unknown individual. 

“I'm thinking, okay, she's never done this before, but she is a teenager and she’s 18, about to graduate, so maybe she's decided that she's gonna flex her independent muscles,” Laurell said. “But I stayed up all night because I'm looking out the window thinking, ‘you're going to be in trouble, young lady, when you come home’…daylight came and she wasn't at home.” 

At first, Hall's family thought she might have gone straight to school that morning. 

“My middle son, when he got to school, he called home. He probably bugged them all day, that office, but he called home and he said she's not at school.”  

That’s when Laurell reported her daughter missing to police. Thus began an enduring search which has lasted to this day. Cleashindra family hung up flyers around town and contacted the news, while police eventually searched the area including Dr. Amos’ office, but found no clues that could point to the whereabouts of Cleashindra Hall. 

“We’re still searching. It’s been 26 years, and 26 years is a long time not to know anything,” said Laurell. If we could just get one tip, one clue, we might be able to break the case open.”


Although Cleashindra was 18 when she vanished, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children is still involved with her case due to a provision of the PROTECT Act of 2003 known as “Suzanne’s Law.” Named after missing 19-year-old college student Suzanne Lyall from Albany, NY in 1998, this law extends to missing young adults 18-20 the same reporting and law enforcement response requirements already provided for children younger than 18. Thanks to Suzanne’s Law, NCMEC is able to use our resources like poster creation, media distribution, family advocacy services, and age progression technology to aid in missing young adult cases. 

Each year on Cleashindra’s birthday: March 30, her missing date: May 9, and Labor Day, Cleashindra’s friends and family release pink balloons to keep her case in the public’s eye, and to let everyone know that they’re still searching. 


“She was somebody that had a light that meant something. She had goals and she had dreams just like everybody else. And our family had dreams and goals for her, too. And so somewhere we're missing out on seeing what our life could have been.”

Hello everyone.

I have been reading a few unsolved cases lately where I realized that the possibility a person was possibily LGBTQ was not even considered and could help the investigation if it had been.

For example,

One of the victims of the Long Island Serial Killer keeps being referred to as ""an asian male"". The forensic portrait clearly makes the victim look like a generic cishet asian man. But the fact is that most of the killer's victims were women, a large portion of them sex workers. So how come investigators never stopped to consider the victim was possibly a trans woman who was assigned male at birth? And also happened to be a sex worker, which is unfortunately work that a lot of trans women turn to when they struggle.

Also, many cases where someone never really had a girlfriend, lived in a strict religious family environment, was acting distant before their disappearance and seem to have planned some sort of getaway and the family is like ""no, I know my child"" despite the fact that most parents don't really know their adult children that well.

Do you have any cases that come to mind in that sense?

## The discovery  
On September 5th 2012, [William Brett Martin](https://www.faitsdivers.org/brettmartin2.jpg), a retired member of the Royal Air Force, was biking on chemin de la Combe d'Ire (a forest road) in [Chevaline](https://www.map-france.com/town-map/74/74072/small-administrative-france-map-Chevaline.jpg), close to Annecy (east of France, or south-east if you’re from Paris) (note that it is close to Swiss, being in the French Alps). During his ride, he was passed at 3:15 PM by another cyclist (later revealed to be Sylvain Mollier), a “green or dark-colored” 4x4 car, and a few minutes later a motorbike.  
A while later, in a parking lot situated at the end of the road, he finds a little girl that appears hurt falling on the ground. He can see a cyclist laying on the ground and a [BMW 5 Series estate car](https://i2-prod.getsurrey.co.uk/incoming/article5841851.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/french-alps-shooting-gallery-11.jpg)(English car, steering wheel on the right side) wheels still turning. Approaching the car, he notices a few holes on the driver side and a “hot burning engine smell”. He breaks the window and turns off the engine. Looking inside the car, he can see people with “heads with bullet holes in them”. He secured the little girl and moved the cyclist's body from under the car and went to get help, his mobile phone having no signal.  
Going down the road, he crosses a car at 3:44 PM, telling them to call for help, which arrives at 4:03 PM. At around 6 PM, multiple cops and a helicopter are dispatched to secure the area.  
Around 11 PM, another vacationer, spending the holidays at the same camping site, notifies the authorities of the existence of another little girl. She is then found safe around midnight, hidden under her mother’s legs(rear seats) for about 8 hours. She wasn’t found earlier because the policemen were waiting for the forensics.  
 
 
##  The victims  
* The Al-Hilli family  
[The family](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02827/hillisUSE_2827089b.jpg) is from the U.K., of Iraqi origin and has 5 members. [Saad](https://i2-prod.getsurrey.co.uk/incoming/article5841687.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/saad-al-hilli.jpg), the father (50), [Iqbal](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2019545.main_image.jpg), the mother (47) a Swedish dentist from Iraq, their two daughters Zainab(7) &amp; Zeena(4)(both of whom are still alive), and Suhaila al-Hallaf, the mother of Iqbal (74).  
On the 29th of August, they left Great Britain on the 10 PM ferry, for a trip to France (Haute-Savoie) with a planned return on the 7th of September.  
They first reached the “Village Camping Europa” camping site in Saint-Jorioz, on the western shore of Lake Annecy. This is the third time they came here on holidays. They booked the space for one week but left after only two days. They moved their caravan 2.6 km(1.6 mile) from there to another camping site: “Le solitaire du Lac”.  
According to a camper, Saad was seen having a very heated discussion with a visitor wearing a suit. However, different versions of the event exist where the discussion happened on either camping site.  
Each victim was shot twice in the head, and the father was shot 5 times overall. The eldest daughter was hit by the aggressor with the butt of his weapon that resulted in a skull fracture, and shot in the shoulder.  
* Sylvain Mollier  
The cyclist, [Sylvain Mollier](https://www.ulyces.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ulyces-chevalinemeurtreep1-08.jpg), father of 3, was a 45 years old local. He was employed in the Ugine factory of the Cezus company, a member of the [Areva nuclear group](https://www.sa.areva.com/). On a ride during his paternity leave, he was shot seven times.
 
 
## The police investigation  
[**Map of the area**](https://i.imgur.com/jRy6EBj.png)  
[**Crime scene (NSFW)**](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/image/_W63AXgAn-4VBjPZypMldAnVEYU/600x400/regions/2020/06/08/5ede8daad953d_chevaline_vue_aerienne_de_la_scene_de_crime_1.jpg) [Additional](https://images.sudouest.fr/2012/10/29/57ecc94b66a4bdfb7ce38a0f/widescreen/1000x500/le-5-septembre-saad.jpg) [angles](https://i.f1g.fr/media/cms/704x396_crop/2020/09/03/c76880389a5285f4bd23810cbf5ecf7e2d75865f23876ba9926e79414fccd0d3.jpeg)  
The Combre d’Ire road is accessible by car for 12.7 km (7.9 miles) and ends in a small parking lot (called Martinet) but continues with a small dirt road only accessible by foot. It is a common spot used by hikers that leads to Jarsy (small city).  
Searching Saad’s past, it appears his dad fled Iraq after his brother was tortured with his wife and his two sons (Zaid and Saad) to move to London. The family owned a home valued at more than 1 million pounds. Their father died in 2011 and the cause of his death isn’t clear.  
Saad’s brother Zaid worked in accounting. In 2001, Saad founded his own engineering company with his brother as secretary until he was replaced by his wife in February 2011. He worked on contracts including some work on the inside of the A380 and on SSTL since 2010.  
Saad’s wife Iqbal is a Swedish dentist. They apparently met in Dubai in 2003. From February 1999 and January 2001, Iqbal lived is the US where she met, married and divorce [James Dudley Thompson](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/11n05dudley-488127.jpg). He died from cardiac arrest September 5th 2012 at 5 PM (local time), meaning he died only 7 hours after his ex-wife. Saad apparently wasn’t aware of this first marriage. It was however believed that he could have been poisoned. Authorities have asked if they could exhume his body, but the family refused to comply. 
As soon as the French detectives started working on the case, they asked for a joint investigation with the British police to be able to bring it on English soil, to search their home and question relatives. After much investigation, the passports were impossible to be found.  
On November 4th 2013, an [Identikit picture](https://images.ladepeche.fr/api/v1/images/view/5c2e16d03e454640eb6934bd/full/image.jpg) was shared of the biker, wearing a GPA type ISR helmet.  
The girls were questioned but the youngest saw nothing, being hidden and the oldest barely spoke, only mentioning that there was only one “bad guy”.  
Ballistic analysis showed the all the victims were shot with 7.65 caliber ammunition from the same weapon, a [Luger P06 Parabellum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Luger-M1900.jpg), which was a weapon issued for the Swiss army at the start of the 20th century. This kind of weapon is most likely owned by local families and collectors. At least 21 shots were fired (although some sources say around 25) and the magazine can only hold 8 bullets, meaning the shooter had to reload at least twice.  
Looking for the 4x4 car, a witness gave a detailed description of the BMW that he saw on the road leading to the parking lot. A very important piece of information he gave was that he saw the steering wheel on the right side, indicating that it was probably an English car.  
During the investigations, two different DNA profiles were taken from inside the car. But it was soon revealed that the crime scene had been contaminated.
 
 
## How the shooting (probably) happened  
Saad parks his car in the parking spot, and goes out with his daughter.  
A shooter coming from the road after the parking lot starts shooting, hitting the father, the French cyclist and one person seated on the rear seats (because of the position of the bullet casings and the broken glass).  
Saad gets into his car, gets into reverse and tries to get away from the shooter. It is believed that he left his daughter outside, explaining why she could get away from the area. Saad does a reverse maneuver with his car (indicated by the tire marks) but drags the body of the cyclist alongside his car. The car gets stuck on the dirt pile delimiting the parking lot.  
The shooter gets closer to the stuck car and starts shooting at the people inside the car (another window broken and more bullet casing on a different spot).  
The shooter gets to the little girl and hits her (most likely with the butt of his weapon) on the head (possibly because he was out of ammo) before leaving the scene.  
The British cyclist arrives at the crime scene, secures the other cyclist’s body, the car and the little, and then goes looking for another car to call the police.

## Dead leads
* A policeman and weapon collector, matching the profile of the biker, was questioned but was soon released, not matching any of the DNA samples taken.
* By analyzing more than 4000 mobile phones, the biker was found. He appeared to be an honest businessman that was doing some paragliding and was coming back home, according to the detectives.  
* In June 2014, a former legionnaire, acquaintance of the murdered cyclist, ended his life, saying in a suicide letter that he couldn’t bear the accusations and the suspicions. He was later cleared from the investigation.  
* Working on new technologies, it could have been possible Saad was killed because of industrial espionage.  
* Haydar Thaher, brother of Iqbal and son of Suhaila al-Hallaf had a history of violence against his parents and was missing from the family home in Stockholm. He was later found hospitalized in England since a few weeks ago, having an alibi for this day.  
* The idea of grand theft auto that turned wrong was put forward, because of previous incidents of the same nature that happened around the same area lately. In November 2013 a similar case happened close to Chevaline where two burglars shot the woman and beat up the man who owned the place.  
* A South African weapon collector was arrested in 2017 in the general area but was soon freed from any suspicion because the only relation was the area and the weapons.  
* A local criminal named Nordahl Lelandais, who was judged guilty of killing an eight-year-old in September 2017 and a 24 years-old soldier in April of the same year, was investigated for this shooting. He was later ruled out, justified partly by the fact that the shooter was very accurate with his gun, something that Lelandais didn’t have the training for, being a dog trainer for the army.  
 
 
## Possible leads  
* The brother of Saad was investigated, their father died recently and apparently possessed a heritage of multiple millions of pounds, including houses in England, France, Swiss and Spain. Multiple witnesses reported that Saad was preoccupied during the last months by a problem of unknown nature. BBC Panorama also found that Zaid had forged documents to withdraw 2 million pounds from his late father's estate.  
* Police also believed Saad could have been targeted over a contract for Airbus, and have investigated whether his murder was a result of contract killing. Supposedly, a 35 year-old Iraqi was hired for a hit on some Iraqi. Shortly before his death, he apparently visited a bank in Geneva. It was believed that Saad could have had access to Saddam Hussein’s missing fortune but was soon denied by intelligence agencies saying the two weren’t linked whatsoever.
* It had been suggested that Sylvain Mollier, the cyclist, was the target instead of the Al-Hilli family. Since he was a welder in a stainless steel factory that was contracted by a nuclear energy company, he could have been targeted for what he could have known. It was later revealed that he had never been exposed to any nuclear secret.  
 
 
## A new turn of events?  
Earlier last year (February 2021), Marie-Hélène Dini, a sports coach, was almost shot by a hit squad that was hired by one of her rivals. Jean-Luc B., a business coach and Freemason was allegedly the one who spent more than $60K for the hit. The men that attempted to kill Ms Dini were arrested and ammunition (apparently rare but 9x19 is very common, we lack a lot of details) that could fit the Luger P06 were found at the home of one of them, although the hitmen were using a different kind of weapon on this day.  
Quite recently (September 30th, 2021), the location of the murders was blocked off by police. They were trying to time the different versions of the shootings to rule out discrepancy. They also did a 3D reconstruction of the crime scene. We can assume the investigation is still ongoing.
 
 
## Still unanswered questions  
* Was it really a hit when the weapon used was a WWII relic and the ammunition for it is hard to find? Should it be a local then or was the weapon acquired locally from what was available? The accuracy indicates a professional hit, but the weapon says otherwise.  
* Who was the target of the attack? The father of the family or the cyclist? It’s likely the cyclist was just at the wrong place at the wrong time, but it’s hard to find a reason for the murder of the father. Was there even a target, and wasn’t this the result of an attack by a psychopath? 
* Why was the little girl spared? Did he run out of bullets and tried to get away fast, or did a quadruple murderer suddenly have morals?  
* Who was the man Saad had a heated discussion with? Where and when did it actually happen? Is this why they changed camps? What was the subject of their discussion?  
* Can the recent developments finally bring an answer to this mystery? But if it was a hit squad, who hired them? The brother? The man who the father had a heated discussion with?

92,Main_Initiative,[],1642086832,"**It’s been more than a decade and no one has still ever heard from Stuart Issac who left for a cross country road trip to Yellowstone National Park in 2010.**

[Stuart Isaac](https://uncovered.com/cases/stuart-isaac) a native of the Republic of Palau, was living in Burtonsville, Maryland with his family in 2010. A stocky man at 5’8” and 215 lbs, Stuart Issac was not usually an outdoorsman, but on September 6, Stuart decided to pack a bag, write a note to his family and leave for a roadtrip to Yellowstone National Park in his 2009, black Lexus Sedan—with no prior experience with hiking or camping. On September 7, 2010, 32 hours after he left his home in Burtonsville, Maryland, Stuart arrived at Yellowstone National Park.Then, 2 weeks later, he phoned an old friend from high school,on September 24th. Since Matsue lives in Guam, typically the two communicate via email or text. The call was unexpected because of the time change—it was 3:30am EST for Stuart. [The call lasted for at least two hours](https://missingnpf.com/listing/stuart-isaac/).Two days later on September 26, Stuart parked his 2009 black Lexus IS-250 sedan with a license plate that read BELLEK at Craig Pass, which[ is approximately eight miles east of Old Faithful Geyser  Yellowstone National Grand Loop Road in Wyoming](https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/stuart-isaac). 

Stuart was discovered missing during a routine night patrol in the Craig Pass area later that night. An officer had discovered Stuart’s abandoned unlocked car with his keys still inside but no other trace of Stuart. [Craig Pass is known to have an approximate elevation of 8,362 feet and has a mountain pass located near Continental Drive.](https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/stuart-isaac) There were no hiking trails in this area. A land and air search began immediately but no sign of Stuart. 

**A timeline of events for Stuart’s disappearance** 

* **September 6, 2010:** Stuart left a note for his family telling them he would be going on a cross-country road trip. The note does not mention when he plans on returning.
* **September 7, 2010** | Stuart arrives at Yellowstone National Park. The drive is roughly 32 hours from his home in Burtonsville, Maryland. 
* **September 24, 2010** | Stuart’s whereabouts are unaccounted for until September 24th when Stuart has a two-hour-long phone call with his friend from high school, Matsue Evens. Typically Matsue and Stuart communicated through text or email, therefore it was odd that he was calling. She lives in Guam, when Stuart called her it was 6:30 PM for her and 3:30 AM EST for him.
* **September 26, 2010** | Stuart parks his black 2009 Lexus IS-250 Sedan at Craig Pass. This area has no hiking trail. [His vanity license plate read BELLEK”. The car was unlocked and the keys were left inside. About eight miles East of Yellowstone National Park Grand Loop Road](https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/stuart-isaac).
* **September 26, 2010** | Later that day, Stuart's abandoned car is discovered by a routine patrol check. Stuart is nowhere to be found. A land and air search begins immediately for Stuart. 

It is still a mystery as to why Stuart went to Yellowstone so abruptly. And to this day he is still missing. Where was he between the time when he arrived at the park and when he called his friend weeks later? Were you in the Yellowstone National Park area on September 24, 2010 and remember seeing a 2009 black Lexus IS-250 Sedan?

93,thenorius_enricheto,[],1642085985,"Joshua Guimond, a third-year student at St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, attended a party with some of his friends on Saturday night, November 9, 2002. It was a small gathering of less than 10 people, and was held in a Metten Court dormitory.  Josh left the room just before midnight, and friends of his assumed he was heading down the hall to use the bathroom.  When he didn't come back after 15 minutes, they wondered if he'd decided to go back to his apartment on campus.  They tried to call him there;  when they got no answer, they thought he was already asleep.  Josh wasn't sleeping though, and he never came back to his apartment.  He was never seen again.

Josh grew up in Maple Lake, Minnesota.  He majored in political science at St. John's and was a popular student with many friends.  St. John's was a rather small school, with about 1850 students.  Located 120 kilometers northwest of Minneapolis, it provided a peaceful and quiet learning environment.  Surrounded by acres of woods and several lakes, students used to joke that they were separated from the rest of society by a pine curtain.  They saw their campus as a utopian place and rarely thought about security.

Josh planned a future in politics after graduation.  He was the treasurer of the Pre-Law Society and co-captain of the university's mock trial team.  A student of excellence, he was considered responsible, logical and very organized.  He taught other students and loved to spend hours debating political and legal issues.  His grandmother had served two terms in the Minnesota House of Representatives, and Josh wanted to follow in her footsteps.  He even used “Senator Josh” as his email name.

THE DISAPPEARENCE

Josh spent the afternoon before the party working on an article he was writing about Alexander Hamilton.  He then relaxed with some friends in his apartment for a few hours, drinking beer and talking about the future.  Around 11 pm, the group decided to meet up with some other friends, so they left Josh's apartment at St. Maur House and walked the short distance across campus to Metten Court.  There, they continued drinking beer and playing cards.  Friends saw Josh leave the room about 30 minutes after he arrived and assumed he was just leaving to use the bathroom.  No one has reported seeing Josh leaving Metten Court, and no one remembers seeing him walking back to his apartment.  His movements after he left his friend's room are completely unknown.

Josh was scheduled to be at a mock trial meeting the following afternoon at 2:30 pm.  When he didn't show up, several of his companions tried to reach him in his apartment, but got no response.  It wasn't like Josh to miss a meeting, so friends of his were immediately afraid that something was wrong.  After comparing notes, they realized that no one had seen Josh since the night before.  His car was still parked in the designated spot, and nothing seemed to be missing from his apartment.  Concerned, they alerted campus police who believed Josh was missing.

 Campus police were not initially worried.  While it wasn't like Josh to disappear, he was a 20-year-old college student.  They assumed he simply met up with some other friends and went out for the night.  They did a quick search of the campus that night, but found nothing to indicate where Josh might have gone.

Josh's friends and classmates expected him to show up the next day with a good story about where he'd been.  When he missed classes on Monday morning, they knew something was wrong.  They called the Stearns County Sheriff's Department and reported Josh missing.  Deputies conducted a massive search for Josh that day, combing all 2,400 acres of the St. John's campus, as well as 700 adjacent acres of forest.

Search dogs were brought in to see if they could track where Josh might have gone when he left Metten Court.  To get back to his apartment at St. Maur House, Josh would have to cross Lake Stumpf using one of the two bridges.  After tracker dogs appeared to smell him near a culvert on the east end of Lake Stumpf, officers feared Josh might have fallen into the lake.  Although the waters were relatively calm, the water temperature was only a few degrees above zero.  If Josh had fallen, he wouldn't have been able to survive for long.  An extensive search of the lake failed to produce any evidence that Josh was in the water, but police would continue to monitor the area.

A Minnesota State Patrol helicopter flew over the campus using infrared radar but found nothing relevant to the search.  Delegates on horseback scoured the wooded areas around the campus, and volunteers helped search the campus.  Police contacted all the hunters who participated in a controlled deer hunt near the campus on Sunday afternoon, but none of them saw anything unusual in the woods.

 Josh's parents arrived at the university on Monday afternoon and made tearful pleas for information about what had happened to their son.  Brian Guimond would spend the next few nights sleeping in his son's apartment, talking to the students about Josh and gathering ideas for possible search areas.  He attended several press conferences and made a strong appeal to area residents to check their properties for clues to Josh's whereabouts.  He was convinced that Josh had been kidnapped.

The police found nothing to indicate that any crime had taken place and they believed that Josh had likely fallen into the lake and drowned.  They pointed out that Josh had been drinking before his disappearance and may have tripped in the water and gotten too drunk to go out.  His friends, however, noticed that Josh didn't seem to be at all harmed that night.  Although they admitted he had consumed about ten beers, he did so over the course of six hours and appeared to be perfectly sober during the walk to Metten Court less than an hour before disappearing.

Over the course of three days, an area of ​​20 square miles was thoroughly searched several times, but nothing was found.  The police became increasingly convinced that Josh would be found at one of the lakes on campus.  They worked with university officials to lower the water level in Lake Stumpf;  although the lake was very shallow, the water was very murky.  Divers were sent several times without success, so the lake was washed away as the water level dropped.  Once again, nothing was found to indicate that Josh was at Lake Stumpf.  The divers were sent out again a week later, this time with side-scan sonar equipment that gave them a detailed view of the lake floor.  They didn't find any evidence of Josh.

 Detectives interviewed Josh's family, friends and classmates, but found nothing to indicate that he had planned his own disappearance.  He was known on campus for being responsible and sensible, and he was doing well in every class.  A computer search of him turned up nothing;  His research history was free of anything incriminating and he preferred humor sites and political discussion groups.  They found several articles he'd downloaded the afternoon before he disappeared, and they all belonged to his research work on Alexander Hamilton.

Although Josh's parents continued to believe that he had been kidnapped from campus, the police still leaned towards the theory that he had fallen into a lake and drowned.  They noted that if he had ended up in the water, the weather would have played a role in his efforts to get his body back.  If the air temperature remained consistent, they believed it could float to the surface in a day or two.  If temperatures start to drop, however, ice will begin to form on the lake's surface and his body may remain trapped under the water until the spring thaw.

In April, the search for Josh was renewed.  His father took time off work and spent hours kayaking on campus lakes, praying for answers.  He still thought Josh had been kidnapped, but he was keeping an open mind and knew there was a possibility the lake would finally reveal its secrets.  He carefully monitored the water temperature every day, but even the hottest water produced no evidence of his son.

 In May, the Trident Foundation arrived on campus to do its own research on the lakes.  Known as the nation's leading authority on water search and rescue, they were confident they would be able to find Josh if he was actually in the water.  They spent days sending divers to the lakes, using specialized equipment to aid in their search.  One by one, they cleaned up every body of water on the campus and determined that Josh wasn't there.  The executive director told police that his recommendation was to take the search in a different direction;  Josh hadn't fallen into one of the lakes.

 For Josh's parents, the Trident search simply confirmed what they already knew: Josh wasn't on campus.  Something must have happened to him that night that made it impossible for him to come home.  The detectives were lost.  They'd interviewed everyone on campus the night Josh disappeared, and no one had seen or heard anything unusual.  They were confident that Josh hadn't staged his own disappearance, and now the idea that he'd drowned in one of the lakes seemed impossible either.  They were willing to consider the possibility of foul play, but they had no evidence pointing in either direction.  The investigation stopped.

DETAILS

One month before Josh went missing, St. John’s was in the headlines. The college announced a major settlement of a dozen cases of abuse by monks at the Abbey on campus. Josh’s father would also learn that monks, who were credibly accused of past abuse, supervised both his son’s dorm and the one where he was last seen.
He never knew of the school’s history before.

Brian’s persistent questions and trips to campus were met with a restraining order by St. John’s. The college denied WCCO’s request for an interview. But, in a statement said there is “no evidence linking the abbey” to Josh’s disappearance and including the monks in our report is “journalism by … rumor.”
WCCO asked the Stearns County Sheriff’s Office if it thinks St. John’s had something to do with his disappearance.
“We have no hard evidence that leads us to believe or not to believe that anyone is involved or not involved in the reason Joshua is missing or what happened to Joshua,” Sorenson said.
Guimond’s roommate admits whatever may happened to his friend soured his relationship with his alma mater.
“Had there been some kind of accident like you hear about or still do hear about with college students he would have been found by now,” Hydukovich said. “It’s always tough this time of year.”

Brian Guimond suspects that Josh's disappearance could be related to St. John's Abbey, which has been home to a number of monks accused of sexually abusing children. He thinks his son might have been ""set up and grabbed"" and said the Sheriff's Office has been reluctant to look in that direction. ""Well, there was no investigation,"" Guimond said. Officials said he fell into a bog or lake and ""pretty much that was the end of the story as far as the Sheriff's Department is concerned.""

The scent of Chris Jenkins, a missing University of Minnesota student, was traced to St. Johns by Hoover, a man-trailing bloodhound hired by the Jenkins family. Hoover traced the scent to St. Johns Abbey and the dog showed interest of entering. From the apartment where Joshua was last seen, Hoover followed his scent to Stumpf Lake, on to Joshua’s apartment and then on to the Abbey.

Hoover appeared to pick up Joshua’s scent in the back of the Abbey after gaining permission to enter and then to the lake behind the Abbey.

Hoover was brought out again and followed Joshua’s scent to Sagatagan Lake and out onto the lake. Hoover had traced the scent to the center of the lake when St Johns Life Safety staff member asked the group to leave for interfering with the investigation conducted by the Stearns County Sheriffs Dept. and because pets were not allowed on campus. A later clarification by Michael Hemmesch, Director of Communications at St. Johns, stated that both reasons were true but the crew was actually asked to leave because the search was not coordinated through the Stearns County Sheriffs Dept. and their search would impede on the investigation.

The body of Chris Jenkins, the missing U of M student, was found in the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis,in February 27th,2003.The Jenkins and Guimond families had been working together to find their sons after both were reported missing within the same two-week period.

St Johns University Via The Order Of St Benedict take out court Order of restraint against Joshua Guimond’s father to stop him from further searching for his son at St Johns University and St Johns Abbey and they win.

In the hours after Guimond disappeared, and on subsequent days, someone erased items from his computer hard drive. It isn't clear who did this or whether the erasure is connected to his disappearance. Some of the information that was erased, and later recovered, was about making fake identification cards.

At around the time Guimond, disappeared, three other college-aged people disappeared from the Minnesota and Wisconsin areas. They were all Minnesota residents, and all of them vanished on weekend nights after having visited bars or parties.

The bodies of two of them were subsequently found in local bodies of water. The third, Erika Dalquist, was the victim of a homicide. Her remains were found on May 15, 2004 on property owned by the grandparents of William Gene Myears, a long-time suspect in her case, and he was charged with second-degree murder.

None of the missing young adults knew each other. However, it was suggested that the four cases might linked, as it is statistically improbable that four people of similar age would randomly vanish from the same area at around the same time. In addition, all three of the men who disappeared were college students with similar heights and builds, and were described as high achievers.

Police investigated and, citing ""glaring differences"" in the four cases, stated there was no connection.

Guimond's loved ones say it is uncharacteristic of him to leave without warning. They believe foul play may have been involved in his disappearance.

For some reason I feel this is trickier than it actually is to explain. I've been really interested in the last week in the case of **Brianna Maitland**, and among the most interesting tidbits about the case is suspected CCTV sighting of her in Atlantic City, two years after he disappearance. The whole case is eerie and upon a google search I found stills of the video, and a kind of chill came over me. Without context it's a normal still, but even if it's not her, it's still for some reason unsettling to see an unidentified woman attached to the case. Granted, from my deep dive, I'm pretty certain Brianna died shortly after her disappearance. 

Another one is **Amy Lynn Bradley**, who disappeared on a cruise ship in 1998, anyone who's followed the case is probably familiar with photos suspected to be her, post cruise involved in some sort of human trafficking operation.  

**EXTRA:** While no footage or stills are available, there is confirmed footage of a woman appearing to be **Dr. Sneha Phillip** in her apartment lobby, moments before the 9/11 attack, she was last seen on surveillance in a department store the night before. 

Sighting photos below, what do you guys think, do you suspect either to be Amy or Brianna? Personally I think it's likely the photo of Amy could have been her though I believe if it was, she still deceased in the years past, the woman in the Casino however, I don't believe to be Brianna, simply cause of the probability of her death in the case. What are some other cases, with inconclusive photographic or video sightings?

*by -kelsie*

  
***^(\*\*I do not give permission for my work to be used elsewhere on the internet\*\*)***

*Kara Nichols was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado*, with blonde hair and deep dark brown eyes on May 20th, 1993, the daughter of Julia and Paul Nichols. They were proud to have a beautiful baby like Kara. Her parents adored her. She had an older brother, and a baby sister came along soon after she was born. The family was close and spent a lot of time together. Things appeared picture perfect, and basically were, for quite some time.

All of this changed around the time Kara was 15. She loved the family's pet dog more than anyone or anything in this world and they were best friends. Her dog passed away. This changed her life considerably. The grief seemed overwhelming for Kara, she could not believe how much it hurt to lose her best animal friend. She fell into the a deep depression, and her parents could not pull their teenage daughter out of her misery. 

Julia and Paul made appointments for her with a therapist and a psychiatrist, but Kara resisted the diagnoses she received and didn’t take her prescribed medication. It is said her diagnoses may have included bipolar disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. She fell in with some new friends at school who impressed her by doing 'dangerous' things she hadn't tried yet. It's been said they were a grade or so ahead of her, so she probably felt cool being with them and looked up to her new friends.

Even though Kara did not want to take the prescribed medications because they made her feel weird, her new friends offered her drugs and Kara decided to give it a chance since her friends like it. For a short time after taking the drugs, she would feel alive and as if the sadness had been lifted. She knew drugs were considered to be bad, but this was the first time she had felt happiness since her dog died... why would she want to stop? She worked on keeping her secret from her parents, but Julia and Paul caught on quickly to what was happening.

When Kara started using, she became rebellious and manic and immediately began cycling  between mania and depression. This fast rollercoaster can be very dangerous for an unmedicated bipolar individual, and they may not be able to stop themselves from making impulsive or irrational decisions. Kara's cycling between mania and depressive episodes could have been an aspect of her disappearance, however; it is unknown.

Kara needed a high school that allowed her to work at her own pace, so she decided to attend a local alternative high school, Life Skills of Colorado Springs. She graduated, and her family was very proud of her as she had hopes, dreams, and goals for the future. Her family could breathe again.

After graduation, Kara had 2 jobs: modeling part time and waitressing at a local restaurant. Her modeling portfolio consisted mostly of lingerie shoots, partially because they paid more than clothed shoots. She also created a profile on Model Mayhem, an online modeling site that links models and photographers judging by distance, style wanted, and experience wanted.

In the summer of 2012, Kara quit her jobs and moved with her family to Chicago, Illinois. When Kara fell even deeper into the rabbit hole of addiction, her family tried to lift her up and help her out by enrolling her in a drug treatment program. Unfortunately, she was discharged earlier for not following the rules of the program.

That August, after being kicked out of drug treatment, Kara moved back to Colorado Springs on her own. She had missed her friends there and the atmosphere in general. She lived in a home with three male roommates somewhere along Mission Road in the Cimarron Hills area of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her big brother lived nearby which soothed some of the worries of their mom and dad.

On the evening of October 9, 2012, Kara left the home she shared with 3 male roommates after informing them she was heading out to Denver for a modeling shoot. As Kara walked out the door, a dark sedan was seen, and the roommate assumed it was her ride.

Over the next two days, Kara’s brother, who lived nearby, attempted to call and send text messages to her, but she never picked up her phone. Kara Nancy Nichols never returned home and has not been heard from since. He reported her missing to the El Paso County Sheriff's office three days later on October 12, after a search by family and friends led nowhere.

When authorities searched the room, they discovered Kara left behind items she would need if she planned to sing belongings: her purse, identification, clothes, makeup, laptop, and $300.

Her phone records, bank account, and social media have shown no activity since she vanished.  
The last activity on her phone were text messages sent on the night of her disappearance at 11:45 pm. Her cell phone, which has not been found, last pinged to cellular towers north of her home in the direction of Denver.

The investigation into Kara having disappeared floundered initially due to the harsh criticisms of policemen and detectives on the team. As is so often the case regarding young people struggling with substance use, Kara was being looked at and treated as if she was sub-human for living her life the way she did. It is despicable, and all missing people deserve to be cared for and found. A recording capturing the view of one police officer on the case was leaked in May of 2014 by EPCSD, and it shocked Kara's family and the community. *Here is part of an article from Gazette dot com about what happened when Deputy Porter was confronted by Undersheriff Presley and Sheriff Maketa:*

&gt;In the 50-minute recording, a man identified as patrol deputy Cliff Porter is confronted in by Undersheriff Paula Presley, Law Enforcement Bureau Chief Al Harmon and Sheriff Terry Maketa about statements he made in the Nichols case.  
Porter was taken off the case after a couple of months, but he came under fire after statements he made to his replacement were reported to his superiors. He repeated those statements in meeting apparently recorded in March.  
**""I said you know ... maybe somebody would finally just say, look, this is a cold case, this girl is probably dead, we're going to work the leads but we're going to shelve this thing, and we won't overreact every time Mr. Nichols comes in,"" the man says in the recording.**  
The recording was released in a response to a complaint Porter filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday, alleging that Maketa tried to bully him into supporting John Anderson in a bid for sheriff.  
On Thursday, Julia and Paul Nichols released a statement in response to the recording and Porter's lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**""The fact that Deputy Porter has the gall to use our daughter's case as a way to cover his own ineptitude is infuriating,"" their statement read.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**Julia Nichols said the recording indicates that Porter mishandled the case - something they believed all along.**  
""In the first few weeks, we were wondering why he wouldn't respond to our calls, and when he did, he seemed very cynical, very negative about the possibility of finding our daughter alive,"" Julia Nichols said Thursday. She said the family's requests to meet Porter were dealt with reluctantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
A new detective was assigned to the case in February 2013, she said. But she believes the case has gone cold, and criticizes the Sheriff's Office for being ineffective.  
**""You just wonder what else has gone on. You wonder how many other victims have been treated like this,"" Nichols said. ""It just re-victimized a family who's already suffering.""**

Once the authorities who (actually) investigated her case realized the sort of path Kara was headed down, they immediately believed foul play was involved. Kara did work with a pimp, and knowing all of these details broke her family's heart. 

They had tried everything they could to get her to change: private mental health facilities, detoxes, rehabs. Kara's parents appeared to be ready to do anything to save their daughter. Unfortunately, drugs had a massive hold on Kara by the time she disappeared, and her parents' wishes did not come true.

It is heartbreaking that Kara's parents struggle with a lot of guilt, and berate themselves with questions such as, ""What if we convinced her to go to this place? What if she would've liked California rehab more and would've agreed to go?"".

Shortly before her disappearance, she allegedly had a falling out with her pimp. Lots of people hold this theory as the truth of what happened to Kara. However, on November 20th, 2012, the police announced they were searching for two brunette women - one with a half-sleeve tat on her arm - who reportedly had spent much of the day with Kara before she went missing.

*Neither woman has been identified*, at the time of this writing.

On November 30, 2012, a profile featuring her photos popped up on MyRedBook, an online Las Vegas escort site. When police called the number on the ad, her family was devastated to report that the voice on the other end was *not* their daughter's.

Authorities discovered that escort websites often use random pictures lifted from the Internet to advertise online. They dismissed the profile.

Foul play is strongly suspected in Kara Nancy Nichols’s disappearance. Authorities pointed to a strong possibility that she may have been targeted by a new sort of organized group that seemed to become a noticeable issue in America in the 2000s - groups specially created for the exploitation and basically, slavery of models. They would oftentimes harm models they promised a photoshoot as well as payment to.

These men would get the young model hooked on drugs so they're easier to control, pimp them out, sell them to other men or organized groups, and generally make their lives a living hell... and that's just if someone survives the initial kidnapping. Where do the two women come involved? Many believe the two women were sent by one of these groups as a way to ease Kara into attending her 'photo shoot' in Denver.

Mary Margaret Click was 21 years old when she went missing from Thunder Bay, Ontario in July 1978. Mary an American citizen who went missing in Canada. Mary was from Madison, Wisconsin and was planning to hitchhike to Banff, Alberta when she disappeared.  Mary's family last heard from her when she called them from Isle Royale, Michigan on July 1, 1978.  

Mary crossed the US/ Canada border at the Pigeon River Border Crossing, which is between Northern Minnesota and Northwestern Ontario.  On July 1, 1978, Mary's belongings were found on a dirt road off Riverside Drive in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Witnesses reported seeing someone matching Mary's description walking along Riverside Drive. 

She has never been heard from again. 

On August 1, 1978, more of Mary's belongings were discovered in Raith, Ontario (which is about 92 km  Northwest of Thunder Bay, along Highway 17). 

There are very few details available on Mary's case, unfortaunely. What is interesting to me, is that apparently Mary called her family from Isle Royale MI on July 1st 1978 (the day she went missing). However, Isle Royale is an \*island\* in the middle of Lake Superior. The second source on this case states that some of Mary's belongings were found in Thunder Bay, also on July 1st. Somehow, Mary made it across the lake in the ferry to Minnesota, crossed at Pigeon River, travelled about 63km east to Thunder Bay, wandered up Riverside Drive, lost her stuff somehow, and that same stuff was discovered on the same day. Either Mary had an extremely busy day on the day she went missing; or something has been misreported.

97,madz43211,[],1642042987,"
Preface: Most of this information comes from a recent video done by one of my favorite true crime Youtubers, Danelle Hallan, who spoke closely with the mother of Jesse’s children to learn this information.


**BACKGROUND:**
Jesse was 29 years old when he vanished from Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 2015. Jesse was dating a woman named Rachel whomp with they had 2 kids together. He was an amazing father, and loved outdoor activities, including fishing, hiking, and camping. However, prior to his disappearance, his behavior changed.

On August 1st, 2015, Jesse and Rachel got into an argument over money. Rachel had noticed large sums of money vanishing over time. They eventually settled the argument, but Jesse decided to stay at his grandparent’s house a few miles from Tamaqua, rather than where he was living with Rachel in Tamaqua. It’s interesting to note that Jesse did not have a car. Jesse’s behavior also started to change shortly prior to his disappearance, and he seemed exhausted, nervous, and worried. 

August 8th, 2015 was the last time that Rachel saw Jesse. She asked what was going on due to his recent behavior. Jesse responded something odd, saying, “I have to do this on my own, but when it’s over we’ll all be together again.

On August 10th, Jesse ditched work where he worked at an icecream plant. He left his grandparent’s house for work like normal, but rather went into Tamaqua. Witnesses said around 3pm he was seen alone at Burger King. Later that day, he supposedly met with a young woman somewhere for an unknown reason and she ended up stealing some of his money. After that, he met up with some friends and played video games all night. One friend mentioned he was irritated the woman took his money, and was Facebook messaging her boyfriend. Her boyfriend was allegedly apologizing and offered to repay him.

**DISAPPEARANCE**
On August 11th, 2015, Jesse told coworkers he would be headed to work. He first had planned on meeting with the woman’s boyfriend (the woman who Jesse claimed stole his money) at the local Burger King in Tamaqua, but never showed up. Jesse’s whereabouts are unknown from 12pm-9pm. However, Jesse’s phone records show he made multiple calls to his bank to figure out what his balance was. He shouldn’t have been expecting any payments, as he got paid biweekly every Friday.

At 9pm, Jesse made a bizarre phone call to Rachel. He was frantic and told her he was being chased by 10-11 coyotes, his phone was about to die, and he was up in a tree. He asked Rachel to come get him and bring guns. Rachel reported he seemed terrified in the call, almost as if he was about to cry. During the call, he initially told Rachel he was by the Tamaqua elementary school, and then later said he was near the high school. The two schools are on opposite sides of the town. Rachel asked for his exact location, which he would’ve known, but the call dropped. She called him back numerous times, but he never answered again.

Rachel and her brother went to the woods by the high school and spent 2.5 hours looking for Jesse for any sign of him. Rachel then called the police and reported Jesse missing.

**AFTERMATH**
The next day, police as well as friends and family began looking for him. On August 13th, the official search started. Different Search and Rescue  teams searched for almost 12 hours, including drones and dog teams. Pennsylvania State Police even sent a helicopter to look for him. From August 14-16, more teams were sent to look for him, and cameras were sent down into air shafts. August 16 end of day, TPD ends official search. Note that the area is an active coal mine, so there are many air shafts and the terrain is difficult to navigate. 


Jesse’s friend, who he stayed with August 10th, later told Rachel Jesse and to buy meth that night. Rachel says that Jesse never used drugs when they were together.

In December 2015 or 2016 (unsure of the exact year), a hunter near the high school saw a pair of sweatpants hanging from the tree, and Jesse was last seen wearing sweatpants. One of the legs of the sweatpants had been tied in a knot with a rock put inside the leg. He then noticed a backpack further up the tree, which was later confirmed to be Jesse’s backpack. Rachel doesn’t believe this is his bag, because she claims the pin on the bag used to identify it as Jesse’s is in her son’s possession. Both Rachel and Jesse’s mom believe these items were possibly planted at that location. The tree where these items were found is supposedly very hard to reach, and is a skinny tree.

People in town continue to refuse to speak about Jesse or give much information whatsoever. Police are not ruling out that he was attacked by a pack of coyotes nor a gang of “coyotes”. 

**Theories:**

-Jesse was in a drug-induced hallucination.
- Jesse was actually chased by coyotes.
- Jesse  was being chased by a street gang named “Coyotes”. Rumors were spreading that Jesse may have been talking about “Coyotes” as in a street gang that he allegedly owed money to. However, police couldn’t find any known gangs named Coyotes, nor proof anyone was after Jesse.

Holly Ann’s mother claimed that issues had began the year before while she was a senior in High School. “That's when she began taking drugs and having emotional problems. We don't know if one triggered another” said Mrs Campaglia. When Holly Ann ran away the first time she was found a month later walking on Route 70 about a mile away from the family home on Forest hill Road, off Springdale Road. She would go on to run away four more times. “Each time she came back she was less responsive to the medical treatment (she took for emotional problems” said Mrs Campiglia. Her mother says the last time she saw her daughter was when she jumped from the car while going to a counseling center on June 10, 1980. “She said she wanted to get on with her life - ‘I want to see the world and do things my way.’ I tried to pull her back, but the car was on route 70 near the Sheraton Poste, and I couldn't hold onto her.” (Today this address is 1450 Marlton Pike East, Cherry Hill) Her mother informed the Cherry Hill Police Department. “We didn't hear from her for a month, until we got a letter. It said she was living with two guys and … we should try not to think of her anymore. We tried to trace the letter, but the return address wasn't a real street.” The letter was mailed from Sacramento in July, 1980. All further leads went cold.

On August 3rd 1980 a body was found in a Cornfield about a half mile north of Seivers Road and east of Stevenson’s Bridge Road near Dixon, California. (30 Minutes away from Sacramento) The unidentified female was believed to be 15-17 years of age. She was 5’2 and weighed 115 pounds. She had brown eyes and brown hair. It was noted that she had a “Punk rock style” hair cut. She had a small dark mole on the left side of her chin. Her cause of death had been multiple gunshot wounds.

Holly Ann Campiglia was identified as a murder Victim on June 19th 1992 11 years and 11 months after her parents listed her missing. The Campiglia's say their daughters name was accidentally dropped from the computer list of missing persons two weeks before her body was found in Dixon, California. She was shot six times in the head. Cherry Hill New Jersey is about 2,800 miles away from Dixon, California. Her case remains unsolved. No internet articles or sources exist. Newspaper.com has newspapers that provided the facts above.

\- 5 Gunshot Wounds is excessive. 

\- Dixon and the surrounding area had a reputation at the time for a dumping ground for bodies. 

\- The Short Hair at the time may have been an attempt to disguise Holly while traveling, or delay identification of the body. 

\- Are There any similar cases in the surrounding area ?

Saad al Hilli, 50, was killed with his wife Iqbal, 47, and mother-in-law Suhaila al Allaf, 74, near Lake Annecy on 5 September 2012.

They were shot at point-blank range in a lay-by as they sat in their BMW.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, also died after being shot seven times.

Mr and Mrs al Hillis' young daughters survived. Zeena, four, hid in the footwell, while her sister, Zainab, seven, was shot and beaten.

The prosecutor in Annecy said today that an arrest has been made, and French media are reporting house searches are taking place.

It comes after police returned to examine the scene of the murders in October last year.

No one has ever been charged in relation to the murders, which prompted a search of the family's home in Claygate, Surrey.

Last year, detectives were investigating a possible link between the al-Hilli deaths and a gang of contract killers living in Paris.

One of the gang members was found to have pistol rounds similar to the ones fired from the gun that killed the victims.

On May 5, 2003, Byung Song, returned to his Koreatown, Los Angeles Apartment to find his wife Charis, his infant son Nathan and their nanny, Eun Suk shot to death in the bathroom.  The investigation revealed that Chais died at least 30 minutes after the other two and she  had been bound and gagged before she was killed.  Charis had been out running errands earlier that morning and it has been speculated that the murderer had arrived before Chatis returned.  The murderer may have gained entry to the apartment without force, killed the nanny and child and waited for Charis to return home.  It is noteworthy that Charis was bound and gagged rather than killed as soon as she got home.  There is the possibility that the killer was trying to get information from her.  The only forensic evidence was some pieces of rubber believed to have come from household gloves, that contained DNA that could not be identified.

Initially, suspicion fell on the husband.  He was a successful business owner in the garment industry.  He was a bit of a philanderer but otherwise had a good reputation.  He had a solid alibi and the DNA on the piece of rubber was not his.  His 
Position as prime suspect was enhanced when LAPD received an anonymous letter claiming he had hired hit men from Korea to do the job and he had a girlfriend who was hiding out in New York.  Police could not figure out who wrote the letter and the girlfriend was never identified.  The case went cold.

8 years later, CODIS got a hit on the DNA.  The DNA belonged to Robin Cho, a Korean immigrant whose only known connection to the Songs was that he has lived in the same apartment building at the the time of the murders and his parking slip was adjacent to the Song’s.  No evidence was ever found that Cho knew the Songs or had any dealings with them.  The reason Cho’s DNA “hit” when it did was that Cho had recently been convicted of a felony and, under California law, felons must have their DNA entered on the CODIS data base.  The crime Cho had been convicted of was White Collar:  Running a Ponzi scheme.  What he had done was to attempt to operate an investment group without any legal status; something fairly common within the Korean community, and things went bad.  He used new investments to pay off earlier investors who wanted out.  Eventually it all went to the shits and people went to the police.  He pled guilty but served no prison time.

Cho was arrested for the murders based on the DNA evidence alone.  The prosecution suggested that it may have been a burglary gone bad but nothing was missing from the apartment.  There was an unstated suspicion that Cho was hired by Songs husband to do the murder but there was no evidence to that effect.  The prosecution was under no obligation to provide a motive.  Cho denied all involvement and the only explanation for his DNA being at the crime scene was that next to each parking slip at the apartments, there was a storage box that was unsecured.  He had some cleaning supplies that included rubber gloves.  He suggested that the murderer used the Songs’ parking slip and took advantage of Cho’s gloves that were in his storage container.  Cho had moved out of the apartment years before his arrest and there was no evidence of what had been in the storage container.

Cho was convicted and given a life sentence.  The prosecution expected him to make a deal by exposing who had put him up to the murders.  Instead, he continues, to this day, to proclaim his innocence.

It seems to me that a small amount of DNA, in itself, is not enough evidence to meet the standard for conviction.  There was nothing else linking him to the crime.  It is certainly possible that someone arriving at the apartment, intent on murdering Charis, might have rummaged around a storage box for something that might help with the crime.",The Koreatown Murders 2003.

Authorities then relocated Alice to Montreuil-sous-Bois, an emergency home for juveniles. However, an x-ray of her hand determined she was an adult anywhere from 18 to 30 years old.

living nearby led searchers to their remains. Mr. Clouse was found beaten, bound and

gagged. Ms. Linn had been strangled.

The couple left their home in Volusia County, Florida in 1981 with their one year-old

baby for Mr. Clouse to pursue carpentry work in Texas. Soon after, the couple’s car was

returned to the family by a stranger who led them to believe the couple had joined a

religious group and no longer wanted contact with the family.

105,IdentifindersIntl,[],1641933361,"**Fountain Valley, CA** – Identifinders International, in conjunction with the

Houston Institute of Forensic Sciences and audiochuck, announces the identification of

1981 Harris County murder victims as then 21 year-old Harold Dean Clouse and spouse

17 year-old Tina Gail Linn.

&amp;#x200B;

The newlywed couple, who married in June 1979, was found together in a heavily

wooded area 100 feet south of Wallifville Rd. in Houston, TX. They had been deceased

approximately two months prior to their discovery on January 12, 1981, when a dog

living nearby led searchers to their remains. Mr. Clouse was found beaten, bound and

gagged. Ms. Linn had been strangled.

&amp;#x200B;

The couple left their home in Volusia County, Florida in 1981 with their one year-old

baby for Mr. Clouse to pursue carpentry work in Texas. Soon after, the couple’s car was

returned to the family by a stranger who led them to believe the couple had joined a

religious group and no longer wanted contact with the family.

&amp;#x200B;

The couple’s bodies were exhumed in July 2011 by Dr. Jennifer Love, Forensic

Anthropology Director of the Identification Unit at the Harris County Medical

Examiner's office for the purpose of collecting DNA to determine if the two were related.

In 2021 the genealogy research was funded through audiochuck, an Indianapolis-based

media company that produces CrimeJunkies, a popular true crime podcast. Working

I just want to bring it to light again if any of you didn't see it back way back then. I tend to post it every 6 months or so, in the event some of you have not heard of this case.

If you want to follow along with Mr. Fish's murders, look at this trail map: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1KBb7wl42SyL4aDZu7Ij2yqnV1dU&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.693515091142984%2C-74.04155100000003&amp;z=12](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1KBb7wl42SyL4aDZu7Ij2yqnV1dU&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.693515091142984%2C-74.04155100000003&amp;z=12)

Albert Fish was an American serial killer, child rapist and a cannibal. He was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime. Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair.

This is from Wikipedia, and yes I know, Wikipedia, but here it is anyway:

""One of his many victims was 4 year old Billy Gaffney. On February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in Brooklyn with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said ""the bogeyman took him."" Gaffney's body was never recovered. Initially, serial killer Peter Kudzinowski was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a Brooklyn trolley, saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the old man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the ""bogeyman"" matched Fish's. Police matched the description of the child to Billy Gaffney. Detectives of the Manhattan Missing Persons Bureau were able to establish that Fish was employed as a house painter by a Brooklyn real estate company during February 1927 and that on the day of Billy Gaffney's disappearance he was working at a location a few miles away from where the boy was abducted.

The following text is **NSFW**. Viewer discretion is advised.

You have been **warned**.

The following is a confession by Albert Fish to his attorney. The full version was located in Harold Schechter's book *Deranged.* Schechter mentions at the end of his book that he spoke personally with Albert Fish's attorney, James Dempsey, before writing the book. It provided him with an amazing insight into the mind of Fish.

""Not satisfied there, I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a house that stands alone, not far from where I took him A few yrs. ago I painted this house for the man who owns it. He is in the auto wrecking business. I forgot his name but my son Henry can tell you, because he bought a car from him. This man's father lives in the house. Gene, John and Henry helped me paint the house. There were at the time a number of old autos along the road. I took the G boy there. Stripped him naked and tied his hands and feet and gagged him with a piece of dirty rag I picked out of the dump. Then I burned his clothes. Threw his shoes in the dump. Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy cat-of-nine tails. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears – nose – slit his mouth from ear to ear. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head – feet – arms – hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep. They sank at once. I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears – nose – pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.""

Billy Gaffney's body was NEVER found.

""I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a house that stands alone, not far from where I took him A few yrs. ago I painted this house for the man who owns it. He is in the auto wrecking business. I forgot his name but my son Henry can tell you, because he bought a car from him. This man's father lives in the house. Gene, John and Henry helped me paint the house. There were at the time a number of old autos along the road. I took the G boy there.""

Fish describes bringing Billy to the Riker Ave. dumps, and a quick google search of this area will lead you to nowhere in particular. But, he does mention the house where he took Billy to. Albert Fish's son Henry bought a car from him before the murder, which was pre-February 1927. Also, Fish had painted the house beforehand. There may be some sort of record(s), either relating to the automobile purchase or the the painting of the house, dating back to this time that can identify where this house is today. If this was discovered, then we could know where the actual murder took place.

""I cut off the head – feet – arms – hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep.""

Road going to North Beach? Looking this up on google will also lead you to nothing, at first at least.

Then again, this did take place in 1927, and things were named differently back then and are completely different now. Let's start with the so called Riker Avenue dumps. The closest thing to being called ""Riker's Ave."" in Brooklyn is Rikers Island, which sits just north of modern day LaGuardia Airport. (with the help of reddit user oldspice75): But in 1927, there was a street in this area named ""Riker's Avenue"" which is now called 19th Avenue today. This leads directly to LaGuardia Airport.

Image of Astoria, Queens from today, showing 19th avenue (just under the Rikers Island Bridge) [https://gyazo.com/b5c92ed40e13abc321bb9564e6a8fefb](https://gyazo.com/b5c92ed40e13abc321bb9564e6a8fefb)

Image from 1924: (around the time the murder took place) [https://gyazo.com/c53ddcc42b7a5ab073d91a187ea947c8](https://gyazo.com/c53ddcc42b7a5ab073d91a187ea947c8)

Image from 2012: [https://gyazo.com/e630efdb8376bf65a2ba526a3f68525f](https://gyazo.com/e630efdb8376bf65a2ba526a3f68525f)

These are three comparison images.

Now you may be wondering why I keep alluding to LaGuardia Airport so much, and this is why:

LaGuardia Airport sits on the land that used to be Gala Amusement Park. Built and operated in the 1870s, the park closed in the mid-1920s, around a little before the time Albert Fish murdered Billy Gaffney. This area was eventually turned into an airfield, and then was named ""LaGuardia Airport."" BUT, this park was also known as ""North Beach.""

Now, we have a Riker's Island situated right above a park known as North Beach in 1924, and a a Riker's Island also situated right above the LaGuardia Airport today. The road leading to present day LaGuardia Airport is 19th Avenue, or what was once known was ""Rikers Avenue""

Detailed image of Rikers Avenue (present day 19th Avenue) leading to North Beach (present day LaGuardia Aiport) from 1930 (excuse my poor mspaint skills): [https://gyazo.com/d532ddb98676b7609052f4a8f2fa5e03](https://gyazo.com/d532ddb98676b7609052f4a8f2fa5e03)

Possible location of where the murder took place, seems to be an area of dumps and could be where the house was located: [https://gyazo.com/adb6485ae559637f8682c6dc69b18252](https://gyazo.com/adb6485ae559637f8682c6dc69b18252)

All of these locations are only around 10 miles from Brooklyn to Rikers Island/Avenue/North Beach. This would mean that Albert Fish abducted Gaffney in Brooklyn, took him to or near Rikers Avenue, murdered him, and dumped his body in pools of water along Rikers Avenue to the North Beach amusement park in 1927. With all of this said, could this mean that Billy Gaffney's remains are still lying underwater near LaGuardia Airport or even underground the airport itself?

It's highly unlikely that his remains are still even a remnant of it's former self or even recognizable since this murder took place over almost 90 years ago, but this could be the actual location where Albert Fish laid Billy Gaffney to rest.

I often wondered where the actual murder took place as well. I think the closest I have come to narrowing it down was when I read *Deranged: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Fiendish Killer* by Harold Schechter. In it is Albert Fish's extended confession to murdering Billy Gaffney. It is located on pg. 294 of 312 - Location 3828 of 4002 in the Kindle edition.

Fish stated, ""Not satisfied there, I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a *house* that stands alone, not far from where I took him. A few yrs. ago I painted this house for the man who owns it. He is in the auto wrecking business. I forget his name but my son Henry can tell you, because he bought a car from him. This man's father lives in the house. Gene, John, Henry helped me paint the house. There were at the time a number of old autos along the road. I took the G boy there.""

If there are any surviving records of Fish's son Henry buying that man's vehicle, or any information of Fish scheduling a paint job in the mid-1920s, then we could at least determine where Billy was murdered.

Let me know what you all think.

I will include more details that can help you all out if need be, I just wanted to make this as short as possible to get my point across.

Let me just say that I am only just trying to help shed some light on this case and get some more input from you all. It is sort of a theory post on where Billy Gaffney's body may have been laid to rest. Recovering his remains after this long may be virtually impossible and that is not my goal. I am just trying to speculate where his remains were placed, since his body was never found, and that in and of itself is terrifying. It seems to haunt me ever since the day I first read about it.

Case details: 


Andrew Gosden was last seen on September 14th 2007 aged 14 years. 

On the day of his disappearance, Andrew left his family home in Doncaster, UK at 8:05am. Instead of taking the bus to school, he diverted his route and waited in a local park until the rest of the household had left. He then returned home, changed out of his school uniform and into a Slipknot band T-shirt and jeans. He also had a bag embellished with patches of rock bands, within he carried his wallet, keys, and PlayStation Portable console (but no charger). 

At 8:30am he left home once again and made his way to Doncaster railway station via a cash machine where he withdrew £200 from his bank account which contained £214. He purchased a one way ticket to London Kings Cross station on the 9:35am train. 

CCTV shows Andrew leaving Kings across station at 11:25am. This was the last confirmed sighting of him. 

-

Due to a misdialled number from the school, his parents were not notified that he had failed to attend school. It was not until 7:00pm that Police we’re called by Andrew’s parents who had discovered he was not home, was not with friends, and had truanted from school. 

Various witnesses saw Andrew on his day of disappearance including a woman on his train and the ticket vendor at Doncaster train station. The ticket vendor commented to Police that Andrew had refused a return ticket despite the price only being a small amount more than the single. 

It was three weeks before the Metropolitan Police in London obtained the footage of Andrew leaving Kings Cross. Due to the delay, no other footage of him has been discovered as it was most likely erased. 


-

Theories:

1/ Andrew’s family and Police investigated the possibility that he has traveled to London to meet someone whom he had met over the internet however no evidence was found of this. Andrew didn’t use the computer at home and he had no social media presence or email address. 

2/ Andrew’s reason for travelling to London on that day is unknown but it was not his first visit to the capital. He was familiar with London as he had visited family members who lived there. His family commented that he enjoyed the museums and was confident in navigating the city.  He had however not notified his family that he would be visited, and had in fact failed to visit  on a scheduled trip in the months prior. 

3/ Two bands who Andrew enjoyed were playing in London on the night of his disappearance. Thirty Seconds to Mars we’re performing at the Brixton Academy and SikTh we’re playing their last show at the Carling Academy. Police appealed for images from the concerts to contact them so ‘super recognisers’ could scan them for Andrew. No leads ever came from this.

I was wondering if the same approach could be applied to John and Jane Does. How far along are we from clearing the unidentified backlog in the US? How impactful has the recent surge in identifications been when compared to the entire backlog?  


I can't seem to find enough data to draw meaningful conclusions. Best I could find was this:  


[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_decedent#cite_ref-4) claims there were approximately 40,000 unidentified decedents in the United States as of 2006.  
The NamUs about page claims that 4400 unidentified bodies are recovered each year and that about 1000 (23%) of them stay unidentified - their source ([here](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/meco04.pdf)) is from 2004 though.  
Their [FAQ page](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/frequently-asked-questions#faq-what-is-the-extent-of-the-unidentified-person) says they have about 13000 active unidentified person cases in the database and that it grows by about 1000 each year. (no sources cited)

Does anyone have better data on:

* how many unidentified decedents are there in the US?
* how many add up to the list each year?
* how many of them were identified per year before genetic genealogy became widespread? How many of them after?  


Or even better: does anyone know about any sociologist, criminologist, statistician or other that has comprehensively studied this phenomenon?

Thanks.",The last couple of years have seen incredible progress in identifying people. How far along are we from clearing the entire Doe backlog of the US? Has someone been keeping track?
109,Forensic-Alli,[],1641922380,"BREAKING: 1981 Harris County Texas murder victims Harold Dean Clouse and Tina Gail Linn Clouse were recently identified by the Identifinders International team of Misty Gillis and Allison Peacock. Their bodies were found on January 12, 1981 in a heavily wooded area 100 feet south of Wallisville Road in Houston, Texas.

Formerly known online as the “Harris County Does” (NamUS UP701 &amp; UP703) before a large Wikipedia edit, the couple remained unidentified until October 2021 when the science of Whole Genome Sequencing and and the investigative discipline of genetic genealogy were used to finally give them back their identities.

Dean and Tina were natives of New Smyrna Beach, Florida where they were married in 1979. In 1980, they left Florida for Houston where Dean or “Junior” was offered a job with builder D.R. Horton building custom cabinets in new homes. They later moved to Lewisville, near Dallas and were not heard from after early December 1980 when Tina send home pictures of the couple’s year-old daughter to Dean’s mother in Florida.

Dean was periodically involved with a religious group known either as The Brethren or the Jesus People with ties to Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma and may have reconnected with them in Texas. His car was found in Los Angeles several months after the couple was murdered. Someone calling herself Sister Suzanne attempted to extort money from Dean’s mother for the return of the car to Daytona Speedway in Florida in mid-1981. The family had no way of knowing that the couple was already dead and met them hoping to get answers to their whereabouts. They were told, ""they're happy with our group now, they don't want to see you or talk to you.""

At the time of their deaths, Dean and Tina had a one-year-old infant named Holly Marie. The baby, who would now be 42 years old, has not been seen since late 1980. Family History Detectives® is the custodian of the AncestryDNA profile of many of Holly Marie Clouse’s family members on both sides, maternal and paternal.

110,Main_Initiative,[],1641921219,"**Last week marked 30 years since Elena Sanchez Hawkins was murdered inside of her Kentucky home at the age of 29. Could a black truck lead to answers in her still unsolved murder?**

[Elena Sanchez Hawkins ](https://uncovered.com/cases/elena-hawkins) was a young mother of two boys. She was [known to keep to herself](https://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/who-killed-elena-sanchez-hawkins)  and was usually with her family or working as an attendant at a local gas station. Elena and her family lived in a small town in Elizabethtown, KY, which was approximately 45 minutes south of Louisville.

**The day Elena was murdered.** On the morning of January 8, 1992, Elena’s husband, Michael Hawkins, left early for work at a local convenience store. Elena was home with her two young boys. By 7AM, Michael called Elena to make sure that their eldest son was awake and made the school bus. But no one answered, possibly because she was walking her eldest son to the bus stop.

Around 7:30AM a neighbor recalls seeing an older model black Datsun pickup truck leaving Elena’s home. The truck can be described as having a short bed, no chrome and a standard cab as well as “tie-down” hooks and a “metal” topper on the bed. 

**When she was discovered.** By 10AM, Michael calls again to make sure that their eldest son made the bus. [Their 3 year old son answered the phone and told him “mommy’s bleeding”. Michael immediately rushed home and found his wife dead in the living room of their family home.](https://uncovered.com/cases/elena-hawkins) Police were called promptly thereafter and would find no sign of forced entry. It is believed that Elena may have known her assailant. Before Elena was killed, she worked for a local gas station on West Dixie Avenue where she reported that a man gave her strange looks and made her feel uncomfortable.

When Elena’s body was discovered in her living room; it was noted that her throat was cut, her wrists bound and she was sexually assaulted prior to her death. Her cause of death was extreme blood loss. An investigation ensued, and her husband, Michael was cleared as a suspect very early in the process. Unfortunately, little leads surfaced and the case stalled.

**Where the case stands today.** Elena’s case remains unsolved. The most recent update revolves around a possible person of interest. In August 2008, this individual was convicted of another similar crime in Breckinridge County; a woman was assaulted and throat cut in her home. [She pretended to be dead in hopes that the attacker would leave, before she was able to call for help.](https://www.wave3.com/story/9301595/recent-attack-may-help-police-solve-1992-murder-case/) This individual had previously lived in Elizabethtown during the time of Elena’s attack.

[Elena Sanchez Hawkins ](https://uncovered.com/cases/elena-hawkins) was a young mother of two boys. She was [known to keep to herself](https://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/who-killed-elena-sanchez-hawkins)  and was usually with her family or working as an attendant at a local gas station. Elena and her family lived in a small town in Elizabethtown, KY, which was approximately 45 minutes south of Louisville.

**The day Elena was murdered.** On the morning of January 8, 1992, Elena’s husband, Michael Hawkins, left early for work at a local convenience store. Elena was home with her two young boys. By 7AM, Michael called Elena to make sure that their eldest son was awake and made the school bus. But no one answered, possibly because she was walking her eldest son to the bus stop.

Around 7:30AM a neighbor recalls seeing an older model black Datsun pickup truck leaving Elena’s home. The truck can be described as having a short bed, no chrome and a standard cab as well as “tie-down” hooks and a “metal” topper on the bed. 

**When she was discovered.** By 10AM, Michael calls again to make sure that their eldest son made the bus. [Their 3 year old son answered the phone and told him “mommy’s bleeding”. Michael immediately rushed home and found his wife dead in the living room of their family home.](https://uncovered.com/cases/elena-hawkins) Police were called promptly thereafter and would find no sign of forced entry. It is believed that Elena may have known her assailant. Before Elena was killed, she worked for a local gas station on West Dixie Avenue where she reported that a man gave her strange looks and made her feel uncomfortable.

When Elena’s body was discovered in her living room; it was noted that her throat was cut, her wrists bound and she was sexually assaulted prior to her death. Her cause of death was extreme blood loss. An investigation ensued, and her husband, Michael was cleared as a suspect very early in the process. Unfortunately, little leads surfaced and the case stalled.

**Where the case stands today.** Elena’s case remains unsolved. The most recent update revolves around a man named Ernest Pines. In August 2008, Pines was convicted of another similar crime in Breckinridge County; a woman was assaulted and throat cut in her home. [She pretended to be dead in hopes that Pines would leave, before she was able to call for help.](https://www.wave3.com/story/9301595/recent-attack-may-help-police-solve-1992-murder-case/) Pines had previously lived in Elizabethtown during the time of Elena’s attack.While Pines has been named a possible person of interest, it is unclear if he has been interviewed in connection to Elena’s case.

Is Ernest Pines connected to Elena’s murder? Are there other victims of Ernest Pines? Was he driving the Datsun pickup truck that morning? [Have you seen the black Datsun truck in the Elizabethtown area? ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datsun_Truck)

The villages of Upper and Lower Quinton in Warwickshire are unlikely to come to mind when you think of a horrible crime that has gone unsolved for nearly 70 years. Both communities are approximately as rural and sleepy as any other village in the United Kingdom.

Walton had spent his entire life in Lower Quinton, and despite his age and the start of rheumatism, he did modest farm activities whenever he could. Although the popular and well-liked retiree had an eccentric side, some people were suspicious of him. Walton had several idiosyncrasies that distinguished him apart from the other inhabitants in a community where everyone pretty much knew everyone else.

Walton was found cruelly killed in a ditch after a swift search. The hook he used to catch him was lodged in his throat. The pitchfork impaled him to the ground so forcefully that it required the assistance of police officers to remove it. His chest had been carved with a big crucifix, and the blood from the wound had soaked into the ground beneath him.

Police disclosed that they investigated the same location during the early stages of the investigation and discovered nothing.",The Charles Walton Witchcraft Murder

- LAPD Chief of Police William H. Parker: “We identified the Black Dahlia suspect. He was a doctor.”

- LASD Undersheriff James Downey: “The Black Dahlia case was solved, but it will never come out. It was a doctor they all knew in Hollywood involved in abortions.”

- DA Lt. Frank Jemison: “We know who the Black Dahlia killer was. He was a doctor but we didn’t have enough to put him away.”

His name was George Hodel Jr. To her credit, Kail mentions him as one of the ‘possible suspects’. He first came under suspicion following the death of his secretary Ruth Spaulding. It’s suspected that he killed her to cover up financial fraud (billing patients for tests never performed) and to protect his illegal abortion ring. He was also accused of raping his own daughter, Tamar Hodel. His son Steve Hodel is responsible for bringing his father’s crimes to public attention.

The DA has tapes of George saying “supposin’ I did kill the Black Dahlia. They can’t prove it now. They can’t talk to my secretary anymore because she’s dead. They thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it out. Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary.”

It may have been UNPROSECUTED, but it was never unsolved.

I wish she had some kind of justice, but she wasn’t left without a legacy - two weeks after her murder, state assemblyman C. Don Field was prompted by the case to introduce a bill calling for the formation of a sex offender registry. With this, the state of California would become the first state to make the registration of sex offenders mandatory.

118,gaycatdetective,[],1641876481,"Before you read, please note that while there has been a conviction in Sally's case, it is extremely obvious who is responsible for her disappearance and likely death, and it may not *seem* like an ""Unresolved Mystery"" to some, let me reiterate ***her remains have never been recovered***. Sally is still a missing person and her family still deserves closure.

**Background**

In 1976, Sally Brown met Gary Rawlings in Pennsylvania. The couple married in Denver, Colorado in 1977. Sally became Sally Rawlings and fell out of contact with her family. She gave birth to a daughter, Kimberly, in 1980. The family moved to Oklahoma City in late 1981.

At this time, they had a difficult relationship. Gary had a temper and was abusive to Sally. On January 12, 1982, Sally filed for divorce. The divorce was granted on February 24, 1982 and Sally was awarded custody of Kimberly. Sally and her daughter moved into Passageway, a YWCA shelter for victims of domestic abuse. She had a history of past mental health issues and engaged in counseling while staying at the shelter. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 

In March 1982, Sally and her daughter moved again, this time into the Kirkpatrick Hotel, located in downtown Oklahoma City. She reportedly chose this location due to the secured locked front doors. On March 21, police were called to the Kirkpatrick Hotel where Sally was staying. Gary had failed to return Kimberly on time after his scheduled visitation. He arrived at the hotel around 9 pm without Kimberly, and an argument followed. During the argument, he hit Sally in the head. She had a large gash in her head and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Sally told authorities Gary had also stolen important documents from her, including Kimberly's birth certificate. Gary told Sally the next time she saw him, she would be dead. Eventually, Gary returned Kimberly to her mother and agreed to forgo visitation with her for six months.

Later that same month, she began a job as a secretary at the Kerr-McGee Corporation. Over the course of the next two months, she developed a reputation as a good employee who kept to herself and was just a bit odd. She was overheard talking to herself on multiple occasions. 

At this time, Kimberly was enrolled in daycare. Sally would drop her off everyday before work around 8 am and pick her up after work, generally between 5-5:30 pm. She also began looking into local rental properties, paying a private company $45.00 to help locate housing. She had on appointment on May 27 to find out if she qualified for rent assistance from the OKC Housing Authority. Although things seemed like they were turning around for Sally, she would sadly never make her appointment.

On May 26, 1982, Sally ate breakfast with her daughter at a café located inside the Kirkpatrick Hotel, then dropped her off at the daycare center at her usual time. After that, she was never seen again. She did not arrive to work that day. Around lunchtime, the daycare received a call from Gary, who told them Sally would not be able to pick Kimberly up that evening. He requested the director take Kimberly home with them for the night.

Around lunchtime on May 27, 1982, Gary arrived at the day care center in a rental car. He gave them a letter from Sally that stated she was moving to Florida, leaving Kimberly in his care. The daycare gave Kimberly to Gary. Gary then called his mother, Loretta Rawlings, from the airport in Oklahoma City and asked her to pick them up from the airport in Denver. He also asked her to bring a uniform for him because he had to go back to work right after they landed. 

When she met them at the airport, he had only a blue suitcase and a plastic sack containing Kimberly's belongings. He told her Sally had gone to Florida with a boyfriend and had allowed him to keep their daughter for 30 days. He put the suitcase in her car and returned to work, and she took Kimberly home with her. 

The next day, May 28, Loretta opened the suitcase belonging to her son and was shocked to find a gun. Specifically, a .44 caliber Magnum in a wood case. This scared her, and she took the suitcase to her daughter's house in Littleton, Colorado, and called police. When police arrived, Loretta said she knew her son had killed his ex-wife. She showed them the gun and other contents of the suitcase, which included:

* typewritten letters to movers and the Kirkpatrick Hotel with Sally's signature
* velour cleaner
* Sally's work keys
* receipt for a car rental
* Sally's savings deposit book
* Kimberly's birth certificate
* a photo of Sally and Kimberly

Loretta did not believe the signature was Sally's, but her son's. He was arrested and charged with Sally's murder. It is believed he abducted her at gunpoint, forced her into his rental car, drove her to a remote location and shot her, then dropped her body from a plane somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico. Authorities were able to construct a timeline of Gary's movements before and after the murder.

**Gary's Movements**

**May 4, 1982**: Gary traveled to OKC and stayed in the Bel Aire Motel.

**May 11, 1982**: From his parents' home in Colorado, called the same motel and made a reservation for May 24-25

**May 24-25 1982**: Gary purchased $20.00 in traveler's checks before flying to OKC. He was carrying a sleeping bag with him. He told his mother he was going to visit Kimberly and needed the sleeping bag to stay at a friend's house. Upon arrival, he rented a yellow Plymouth Fury. On the 24th or 25th, a man claiming to be Kimberly's father called the daycare center she was enrolled in and asked what would happen if Sally did not pick her up in the evening. He was told the director would take Kimberly home with them for the night. Gary also responded to a newspaper ad to purchase a .44 Magnum handgun. He told the owner he wanted it for squirrel hunting. He bought the gun and nine rounds of ammunition for three traveler's checks and some cash.

**May 26, 1982**: Gary had made six reservations to rent a Cessna 150 during the month of May, but canceled the first five. He kept his reservation for May 26 and arrived at the airport in the yellow Plymouth. He refueled at a Dallas airport and purchased velour cleaner. While there, he made two phone calls; one to his employer and one to Kimberly's daycare where he informed them Sally would not be picking Kimberly up. He refueled again at a Houston airport that afternoon, where attendants noticed a large cloth bundle in the rear baggage compartment. He refueled later that evening near a different Houston area airport and left behind a gas cap. Finally, around 11 pm, he refueled at Meacham Field in Fort Worth, where attendants noted that the plane's gas cap was missing.

**May 27, 1982**: Gary returned the plane, reporting 2.4 hours of flight time. An employee noticed an 8 hour discrepancy between the tack time and the Hobbs meter, the Hobbs meter had been disconnected, the gas cap was missing, and parts of the interior carpet were missing. He also returned the Plymouth, reporting he'd had trouble starting it, and requested a different car. He was given a blue Ford LTD, though employees reported they could not find any problem with the car, except that the mat from the trunk was missing. Gary then went to ABC Movers and arranged for Sally's furniture to be moved to Denver, where he said she was moving. Next, he picked Kimberly up from the daycare center. They then returned to Denver and were picked up by his mother who noted that he did not have the sleeping bag he'd left with.

**May 28, 1982**: Loretta finds the gun and other items in Gary's suitcase and calls police.

**June 1, 1982**: A letter allegedly from Sally was sent to ABC Movers, containing two money orders, the original service order, and a letter authorizing them entry into the hotel.

**June 2, 1982**: Gary was arrested at his parents home in Colorado.

**June 3, 1982**: Kerr-McGee received a resignation letter allegedly from Sally.

**Evidence**

Although DNA testing was not available at the time, blood type testing was done on blood found on the gun and in the rental car and airplane that indicated the blood was NOT Gary's, but could have come from Sally.

A firearms expert determined that the .44 Magnum had been fired five time since it was last cleaned. It contained four live cartridges when turned over to police.

It was determined by a document examiner from the FBI that the letters allegedly sent from Sally could not have been typed on any typewriters she had access to, and had been typed on a machine at Gary's office. He also determined Gary had forged Sally's signature.

Gary's fingerprints were found on the envelope mailed to ABC Movers, and his palm print was found on one of the money orders.

Authorities believe damage to the plane he rented indicated Gary had landed at an uncontrolled airport to move the body from the luggage compartment to the front of the plane. Robert Macy, the district attorney at the time, said he could have ""taken off again, flown out over the gulf and banked the plane to the right with the engine stalled.  All you'd have to do is open the door and give her a little push and she'd be gone.""

**Follow Up**

Gary Rawlings was tried and convicted in 1983 for murdering Sally to gain custody of Kimberly. He argued that Sally was psychotic and went missing on her own accord. He was sentenced to life in prison after the jury deliberated for just one hour. His conviction was upheld in 1987.

**Thoughts**

Gary claimed Sally was psychotic and went missing by her own choice. I sadly could not find much information about this case, and could not determine if Gary is still alive today or not. If he still alive, there is a slim chance he could reveal where her remains actually are. 

If authorities' suspicions are correct and he did drop her somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico, what are the chances she could ever be recovered? 

Do you think there is a possibility he did not drop her into the Gulf, and her remains have either not been discovered or she is a Jane Doe?

119,RDruner870,[],1641871288,"Anyone who lived in the Pittsburgh area in December of 1988 likely remembers hearing the news that a severed head had been found in a Pittsburgh suburb only two days after Christmas. Three decades have passed and many may still remember the severed head while having forgotten exact details of this crazy unsolved murder in Pittsburgh. 

Panic ensued when a severed head was found in a bag in a dumpster in North Versailles on December 27, 1988. Several more body parts – including lungs and teeth – were found dumped in other Pittsburgh neighborhoods, including in Whitaker. Very few remains were recovered but what was found was enough to identify the victim as 22-year-old Anthony Michalowski. 

Anthony Michalowski often went off of the radar, sometimes for days at a time, and some painted him as a “drifter.” The 22-year-old from the North Side of Pittsburgh was last seen alive on Christmas Eve of 1988. Family and friends thought little of his being gone since they were used to his absences. Michalowski was unemployed and spent much of his free time on Liberty Avenue, known at the time as being a hub for prostitution. Some speculate that Michalowski himself was a prostitute, a claim that his family vehemently denied. 

Because only about 15 percent of Michalowski's body was found, Joshua Perper, the Allegheny County Coroner at the time, couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of death and, in turn, couldn't classify the death as a homicide. What was known was Michalowski had sedatives in his system, meaning he could have either been drugged or have overdosed before he was dismembered. Perper, however, asserts that Michalowski was either dead or unconscious when he was beheaded. 

The authorities received plenty of calls about potential human remains that had been found – many were the remains of deer and other animals – but solid tips were illusive. Law enforcement and the local media worked together, hosting a live call in show on WTAE, to gather tips from viewers. The case, however, pretty much went cold until 1992. 

Four years after the discovery of Michalowski's severed head, sanitation workers uncovered a thigh in a dumpster in Shadyside. Eventually, other body parts were recovered, all in trash bags placed in dumpsters around the city. Authorities identified the remains as those of 30-year-old Michael Hickmott. The victim, who had been disemboweled and dismembered like Michalowski, had been unemployed, although he had previously worked as a prostitute. 

Hickmott's death led authorities to a suspect who, according to The Beaver Valley Times, described himself as a “neo-nazi vampire.” Thirty eight year-old Robert Wayne Marshall wore his hair in a crew cut, often donned camouflage, and was said to be an alcoholic. Law enforcement found several connections to Marshall and Hickmott. The shoulder was found in a dumpster not far from Marshall's apartment and, even more incriminating, witnesses told police they had seen the two together the weekend before Hickmott's remains were discovered. 

Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Marshall on May 6, 1992, setting off a manhunt for the suspected murderer. Simultaneously, authorities contacted the FBI to determine if any unsolved cases shared any of the same characteristics of Hickmott's murder. Michalowski's death mirrored that of Hickmott's: Both men had been disemboweled and dismembered with their body parts scattered in several dumpsters. 

Marshall was never questioned or arrested in either Hickmott's or Michalowski's deaths. He committed suicide only two days after he was charged with Hickmott's murder. Marshall left a note, proclaiming his unhappiness and confusion, confessing that he would no longer be in this world by the time his friend received his letter. Authorities considered him a potential serial killer, with perhaps additional victims. 

Michalowski's murder remains unsolved, although the media has revisited the case numerous times, particularly around the Christmas holidays when Michalowski's body parts were first found. Marshall was perhaps law enforcement's strongest lead but hope of ever solving Michalowski's murder may have died with Marshall.

120,erobin37,[],1641869905,"To avoid an unintentional jumpscare by the reddit thumbnail, all links in this post will be split up.

“Jeff the Killer” (JTK) is the nickname for a heavily edited online image that was commonly used as a jumpscare in the 2010s. Over the years, many have tried to locate the original, unedited image of JTK. There are dedicated searches in the Anglosphere and Japan, where the image was thought to originate from. There’s even a subreddit, r/OriginalJTKImage.

The common “Jeff the Killer” image featured what appears to be a dark room, with a rotund, bright white face at the corner. The face had almost cartoonish, spherical eyes and a mouth in a wide grin. The person appeared to have long hair, parted in the middle.

**The search:**

The first step, naturally, was to find the oldest instance of the image, which might point us to its origin. This brings us to an image uploaded on a Japanese image hosting site pya.cc. Translated, the title of the image is “(Scary) Ahhhhhhh!”, and it was uploaded on 16th November 2005. \[1\]

Soon, people found an even older instance of the image. Uploaded on 10th September 2005, it was titled “White Powder (Part 2)” by the user “Mr. Mulholland”. \[2\] The image, also heavily edited, was less menacing than JTK. It featured different eyes and a smaller grin. Upon inspection, the JTK image appeared to have used the liquify or smudge tool on “White Powder (Part 2)” to expand its grin. It can be safely assumed that “White Powder (Part 2)” is the basis for JTK, though still not the original. I’ll call it Proto-JTK from here.

It is known that the eyes of Proto-JTK were photoshopped from a Mr. Potato Head figure. \[3\] The mouth is possible from a stock photo. \[4\]

A frenzied search for “White Powder (Part 1)” yielded nothing. People noted that on the same day when Proto-Jeff was uploaded, a photoshopped, creepified picture of a doll was also uploaded by Mr. Mulholland, who we can assume to be a horror fan. Was he just uploading photoshopped scary pictures for fun? Soon people noticed his personal blog, sorai.jp \[5\], linked from his account \[6\]. People also noticed an active twitter user, @miyama, who also linked to sorai.jp and shared some hobbies and interests as Mr. Mulholland. So naturally, with the power of Google translate, @miyama was questioned about Proto-JTK.

Responding to a question, miyama replied “To put it simply, in mid-2005, a cropped image of a video of a middle-aged Asian woman appeared in Japan. At that point \[her\] face was white. I edited a little in Photoshop to post to ""pya.cc"".” \[7\] He then elaborated that he only messed around with the brightness. Everything else was already from the image he found. The image, a crop of an Asian (possibly Japanese) woman from a video, was a “Japanese meme” being passed around on Japanese BBS. He doesn’t remember which BBS it was, as it was 15 years ago. He claimed he has seen the video in question once, but doubts that it exists on the internet. “The image I found is almost the same as white powder (Pt.2). I just made a few corrections. Therefore, the real creator is another person.” \[8\]

The search for a “Proto-Proto-JTK” thus continues. An even earlier instance of the Proto-JTK image (almost identical to the Mr. Mulholland image) was found posted 4th August 2005. \[9\] Perhaps it is the same image Mr. Mulholland based his image on. Interest in the verifiable (aka non-creepypasta, non-hearsay) search of the origin image has picked up in Japan. Perhaps all it takes is a veteran Japanese internet user to shed light on this image.

**False leads:**

There’s a creepypasta associated with JTK which of course is fanciful fiction and has no value in the search whatsoever.

A popular urban legend is that the picture came from a girl called Katy Robinson, who committed suicide because of cyberbullying. This has since been disproven as the alleged source image was another girl called Heather White. \[10\]

Many Japanese users recall seeing JTK from a late 2000s screamer video called “NNN Temporary Broadcast” (NNN臨時放送). The video ended with a jumpscare of JTK (but not Proto-JTK), so it has little value in the search. The video was a “recreation” of a creepy post where a user recalled watching a mysterious broadcast on TV - around 15 years ago - that listed the names of random citizens, who turned out dead the next morning. Fun (?) fact: He was probably misremembering the list of dead being announced after the 1985 JAL123 air disaster. \[11\]

121,DamnJackieICCTW,[],1641869642,"This story is one in a series I hope to do about mysterious deaths in and around Fort Bragg, North Carolina. I'm starting with Specialist Roman-Martinez's death because I find his case particularly infuriating.

   Specialist Roman-Martinez was 17 when he enlisted in the United States army in September of 2016. After basic and advanced training, he was stationed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina as a human resources specialist. According to his sister, Griselda, he joined the Army because he thought it would teach him discipline and responsibility.

   Specialist Roman-Martinez went missing in North Carolina sometime between May 22nd and 23rd in 2020. After he was reported missing, there was a ten-day search of the area in and around the Cape Lookout National Seashore. The search was called off on May 29th when his decapitated head was found with a “somewhat crescent-shaped, incised vs. chop wound” on the shore of Shackleford Banks Island, NC. His body has never been recovered. 

   During the Memorial Day weekend of 2020, Specialist Roman-Martinez traveled the four hours from Fort Bragg to the Cape Lookout National seashore with seven other soldiers- six men and one woman, all of whom remain unnamed. 

   There's very little information about what happened the night of the 22nd. The group made camp somewhere near marker 46 on South Core Banks, one  of the islands in the park. According to the group Specialist Roman-Martinez was with, they went to bed around midnight on the 22nd, and around that time they saw him walking away from the campsite wearing only blue shorts. When they got up around 8:30 the next morning  they realized Specialist Roman-Martinez was still gone. His phone, wallet, and desperately need glasses were left at the campsite. The group then spent most of the 23rd looking for him, eventually calling 911 sometime around 7:30 p.m.

   What information we know comes from the 911 call placed on the 23rd, and it's fairly garbled. The still unidentified caller claims that they've been looking for Specialist Roman-Martinez  all day, and that they were afraid he might of hurt himself because he had ""suicidal tendencies"". The caller further claims that they've been all over the island, looking for Park Rangers, before eventually reaching the ferry and realizing they needed to call 911. 

   Griselda, Specialist Roman-Martinez's sister, claims that he was not suicidal in the slightest, and that they had recently made plans for when Specialist Roman-Martinez got out of the Army. He was going to live with her, buy a new car, and take a long vacation in Japan. 

   In a statement by the Seashore's spokesman, a group of Park Rangers encountered the group early in the afternoon, asking them to move their vehicles away from some of the Parks sand dunes. The group made no mention of a missing person at that time. 

   US Army Criminal Investigation Command and the FBI spent months running down leads on this case, eventually upping the original reward for information from $25,000 to $50,000. They claimed that there was no evidence of drug use at the campsite on the night of the 22nd. 

   Specialist Roman-Martinez's family is desperate for information in this case. They have hired a Private Investigator. Because of Army CID policy they have never met with, or even know the names of, the soldiers who were with Specialist Roman-Martinez on the night of his disappearance. The case was switched to cold case status in November of 2021.

   On a last and totally anecdotal note, most of Fort Bragg was in Covid lockdown in May of 2020. I do not know for certain if Specialist Roman-Martinez 's unit was, or if his fellow campers were involved in his death. If they are innocent, some of that time spent avoiding calling police or even notifying their chain of command could have been because they were very aware they were going to get in a mountain of trouble for being so far from base against traveling regulations.

If you have any information on this case, contact Army CID at 910-396-8777.

122,pandacake71,[],1641866986,"Robert Durst was an eccentric millionaire most known for the documentary series ""The Jinx."" This documentary explored the three people in his life who had mysteriously disappeared/been murdered, including his first wife, a long-time friend, and his neighbor. During filming, he retreated to a bathroom, not realizing his mic was still on, and was caught saying,  ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."" 

His wife, Katherine, disappeared in 1982. Her body has never been found. Though many, including her family, believe Durst was responsible, he never revealed what happened to her or her remains.

In 2000, he then killed Susan Berman, his very close, long-time friend. The police had recently re-opened the investigation into Katherine's disappearance. Prosecutors alleged that Susan knew details about Katherine's disappearance that would incriminate Durst, so he killed her to shut her up. He was convicted of Susan's murder in September 2021 and [indicted on November 1, 2021](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/us/robert-durst-indicted-wife-murder-charge-new-york/index.html).

After her murder, Durst ran to Galveston, TX. There, he pretended to be a mute woman (??) and befriended his neighbor, Morris Black. He killed and dismembered Morris before dumping him in Galveston Bay. He claimed it was self-defense and was acquitted for the crime.

He was finally tried for Susan's murder in 2020, though COVID-19 delayed the trial until May 2021. He died in a prison hospital today, 1/10/22, at 6:44 a.m. due to natural causes.

Think of a brutal crime that has remained unsolved for over 70 years and the villages of Upper and Lower Quinton in Warwickshire will not immediately spring to mind. Both villages are about as rural and sleepy as any other village throughout the whole of England. 

Walton had lived and worked in Lower Quinton for his entire life and, despite his seniority and the onset of rheumatism, he continued light farm duties whenever possible. The popular and well-liked pensioner had his eccentric side but there were some people that regarded him with suspicions. In a village where everyone pretty much knew everyone else, all villagers knew that Walton had some quirks that set him aside from all others. 

The search was a quick one and Walton was found horribly murdered in a ditch. His trouncing hook was embedded in his throat. He was impaled to the ground by the pitchfork so strongly that it took attending police officers to remove it. A large crucifix had been carved into his chest and blood from this wound had soaked into the ground beneath him. 

Police revealed that during the early days of the investigation, they searched the same place and found nothing there.",The Charles Walton Witchcraft Murder

For those unfamiliar with this guy, here's a link overview: [https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/israel-keyes](https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/israel-keyes)

I started listening to True Crime BS' podcast on Keyes (available on Spotify for those interested) and I'm falling down the rabbit hole of this killer.

I see very little mention of his potential to kill overseas. He mentions that being in the army limited him because they always had a watch on him. However, in recent years, there's been numerous videos and articles surfacing of military and government personnel committing horrific acts while stationed overseas.

Additionally, I would not be surprised if he had victims in Canada, particularly ones that may be associated with the Highway of Tears in BC.

I'm curious to see what other true crime enthusiasts may think. Aside from some of the already discussed potential victims (i.e. Maura Murray is a popular one), are they any others that have come to light in more recent years that you think might have been a Keyes victim, domestic or international? thanks",The Unknown Victims of Israel Keyes
125,mysteryconfidential,[],1641852968,"An unknown dead body on an Adelaide Beach in post-war Australia. 

In 1948 an unknown nameless man washed up on Somerton Park Beach in Adelaide, Australia. The man has never been identified and to this day, the country scratches its head. However; a trail of breadcrumbs has led to the discovery of the man’s possible descendants all the way down to the man’s (potential) great-grandkids living today in Australia.

On the 1st December 1948 at 6.30 am — the police were contacted after the body of a man was found in Somerton Park (about seven miles from the nearest major city Adelaide). The dead body of the man was found lying with his head resting against the seawall with legs extended and the feet crossed. The two boys that found him were out horse riding and initially thought that the man was sleeping or drunk. An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat.

The man also had with him an unused train ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach. He had in his possession an empty packet of Juicy Fruit, a comb manufactured in America, an Army Club (British cigarettes) cigarette packet, and a box of matches.

The pathologist said that the man had a “Britisher” appearance, was aged about 40–45, and was in extremely good physical condition;

“180 centimetres (5 ft 11 in) tall, with grey eyes, fair to ginger-coloured hair, slightly grey around the temples, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, hands and nails that showed no signs of manual labour, big and little toes that met in a wedge shape, like those of a dancer or someone who wore boots with pointed toes; and pronounced high calf muscles consistent with people who regularly wore boots or shoes with high heels or performed ballet.”

The fantastic physique and intensity of calf muscles led some investigators to believe that the man must have been a ballet dancer of some sort or perhaps soccer?

The man was clean-shaven, wearing a double-breasted jacket and suit with “American” tailoring. The clothes that the Somerton Man wore had the labels removed. And his belongings, as well as the ethnic look of the man, suggested that he could have been Australian, European, or potentially American. South Australian police put out an urgent bulletin and many people came to view the body. And nobody local could identify the man. 

The Somerton Man’s last meal was a pasty eaten four hours before death. There were no foreign agents in the man’s body, however, the suggestion was that the internal bleeding and over-enlarged spleen could indicate untraced poisoning. No trace of poison was found but there was intense strain found on some of his organs — including the heart. 

The Somerton Man was embalmed, a death mask was created and he was promptly buried. The local residents generously paid for a headstone and funeral plot so that the man could be buried with a dignified memorial.

Months later the case’s most iconic clue was discovered. A tiny piece of rolled-up paper with the words Tamám Shud was discovered within the Somerton Man’s pockets. The words were not handwritten but instead were printed. A local library official and well-read local linked the pages to the last page of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.

Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a Persian book of poetry attributed to the Persian wordsmith Omar Khayyam and the words Tamám Shud were said to mean THE END (or ended).

The search for the book brought the police to a 1941 edition of the book (a Christchurch, New Zealand publication). The book indeed had the last page ripped out with the words Tamám Shud missing. On the last page, there was a faint indentation representing five lines of text, in capital letters — with possible encryption.

Even the Naval Intelligence could not crack this code. It remains unsolved as a riddle (or perhaps gibberish). 

A phone number was written at the back of the book. This number led investigators to a local nurse who lived within Adelaide. When the nurse in question was shown the death mask, she was said to have been near hysteria at seeing the man and close to fainting and yet, she immediately denied knowing the deceased. She was evasive and refused to talk to investigators about the Somerton Man.

Police did not keep records of the witness nor her details and this hampered the investigation for the next 50 years. Her identity was not revealed at the time and the Australian Police force threw out her name and address (only keeping hold of the telephone number). 

That is until over 50 years later Detective Gerry Feltus matched the telephone number written on the back of the book to a 1947 South Australian telephone directory (which the man had been trawling through every single day since picking up the cold case with the intention of linking the numbers).

This led police back to Jo Thomson — some 50 years after initial contact. Jo Thomson was continually evasive about the case, did not want to discuss the man, and did not let up about her connection to the found body, and to the day she died, she maintained her radio silence on the matter. 

Jo Thomson had a son named Robin Thomson but unfortunately, Robin died before Feltus could interview him. Robin was a former ballet dancer with the same physical attributes as the Somerton Man including the distinguishable dancer’s calves that the mysterious Somerton Man had. Robin had the same genetic form of earlobes as the Somerton Man (lobe connected to the skin). This is a common connection in genetic ancestry, along with sharing their powerful calves and love of dance. 

Professor Derek Abbottlater became engrossed in the case and would eventually locate Rachel Egan (Robin Thomson’s biological daughter and possibly the Somerton Man’s granddaughter). 

The involvement of Mr. Abbott and Rachel Egan would soon turn romantic and they would end up marrying each other and having kids. Professor Abbott had become obsessed with solving the riddle and would draw to more scientific and forensic methods than those used in 1948–49.

Abbott consulted dental experts that concluded that the Somerton Man had hypodontia (a rare genetic disorder) and photographic evidence presented also showed that Robin Thomson had the same condition. Thus bringing the chance of a coincidence on this genetic connection as between one in 10,000,000 and one in 20,000,000. Abbott now fathers the possible great-grandchildren of the Somerton Man.

So Who Was The Somerton Man?

In establishing a potential genetic link all the way down to the man’s grandchildren, there is optimistic progress in this mystery. There is a direct link between the Somerton Man and the only found witness, the elusive Jo Thomson, and in 2021 DNA analysis was underway to find the definitive forensic links for the Somerton Man. 

However; why was the man on the beach that day and what killed him? 

This may never get an answer. 

The most rampant theory is that the Somerton Man was a spy that knew too much. The death was unusual — there was no direct evidence of foul play but the lack of evidential poisoning could be an espionage trick (think of some of the recent types of spy-related murders from ricin to nerve agents). But why would a spy be lurking in the Australian suburbs? And why would an assassin be on his tail? The man clearly had a cosmopolitan aura — he couldn’t be identified, he carried American products, British products, Persian texts taken from a Kiwi library book. But beyond the spy out in the cold theory. It plays out perfectly against the Cold War era. 

Or perhaps he was a drunk that fell asleep down on the beach… 

There’s very little else to go on in terms of murder motives… 

What do you think?

126,moondog151,[],1641850357,"On August 6, 2004, 49-year-old Rajesh Dhayam abruptly went missing. Rajesh was an Administrative Assistant at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in Moka, Mauritius. He was the father of two children with his daughter studying abroad in Australia and lived separated from his wife. He was described as a very reserved man who made no attempts at socializing with his neighbours one of them even stating that he never had a single conversation with him in the two years that he had lived in the neighbourhood.

His landlord Seewan Leelodharry also told police that he had rarely ever seen Rajesh but that he would always deliver on his payments and rent however on one of the few times that he did get to see him Rajesh told him that he was planning on going on a trip to the French island of Réunion. It's was speculated that he had possibly been planning on going on that trip with a young woman named Crithika Nundkumar with who he had been having an affair for quite some time and many residents reported seeing Crithika in the neighbourhood and Rajesh likewise often spent time at her home.

Rajesh was last seen leaving a function at the Indira Gandhi Centre in Vacoas-Phoenix and according to his brother on the day of his disappearance he was carrying a check for 350 000 Mauritian rupees which he had recently deposited from his bank accounts and had just obtained a loan for the purchase of a car. The police searched Rajesh's home and when they found a picture of Crithika Nundkumar they decided that the rumours of an affair had some degree of truth to them and decided to go to Crithika's home to see if Rajesh by any chance happened to be there.

On August 27 the police approached Crithika's home on Béchard Lane in St. Paul. When they arrived, however, the main gate was chained shut and padlocked and once the police broke the locks they approached the home and every door and entrance was locked shut and the blinds and curtains closed so no one could peek inside. Despite this, an officer managed to peer inside the house via a small window and saw what looked to be a body. The police in response broke down the front door and entered the house finding themselves in the living room.

Upon entering the home the very first thing they noticed was the body of 37-year-old Crithika Nundkumar laying on a mattress the police however were not expecting what came next. When they searched the house they discovered a further nine corpses including Rajesh Dhayam. Three of the corpses were found on the first floor and the remaining seven were found upstairs. They were also found in different rooms of the house.

Two of the bodies were Crithika Nundkumar and Rajesh Dhayam but the others belonged to Crithika's son 10-year-old Devesh Nundkumar, her 65-year-old mother Kuntee Mawooa, her siblings 35-year-old graphic designer Chitra Debi Mawooa and 36-year-old Ravi Mawooa. Amongst the bodies were also those belonging to another family who had been friends with Crithika's family with the police discovered the corpses of 40-year-old Mala Devi Jhowry, 17-year-old Yogini Jhowry and a 15-year-old named Bhavish. However the tenth corpse the police did not recognize and were unable to immediately identify. The police were unable to keep quiet about this discovery and it soon dominated the Mauritian press with many flocking to Béchard Lane as to watch the bodies removed with some of those removing them wearing gas masks. The Prime Minister of Mauritius Paul Bérenger even responded to this incident stating ""I offer my sympathies to all those afflicted by this tragedy"" Ravi also requested a 15-day leave from his job due to health reasons which were accepted. His employer was unable to contact him afterwards

The bodies were all found to be in an advanced state of decomposition having been dead for quite some time. When searching the house the police recovered two medallions bearing the initials ""EK"". The medallions belonged to Crithika and Rajesh. Police believed that EK referred to Eckankar a religious sect and non-profit organization and that this could be the result of a mass suicide with religious motivations. Furthermore strengthening this theory was how an autopsy on the ten corpses determined that the cause of death for all of them was cyanide poisoning and that no signs of violence or trauma were observed. The coroner also determined that Crithika was the last of the ten to die and had a glass of cyanide next to her, He came to this conclusion based on the decomposition with her corpse being less decayed than the other nine. Meanwhile, the unidentified body appeared to have been the first to pass and that they had been dead for around 10 - 15 days with the coroner estimating that they all died on August 20. Jean Maunick the leader and founder of the Mauritian sect of Eckankar publicly denied any involvement but admitted that Rajesh had been a member of the sect but he left in 1996 and Jean further stated that he didn't know about the nine other dead. Although the police continued to believe that this was a mass suicide they were unable to link it to Eckankar. The police also took samples from the water tank and anywhere else water was stored just in case it was an accidental poisoning.

Another strange thing noticed is that the deceased all deposited money from their bank accounts like Rajesh Dhayam did on the day of his disappearance.

One of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of the mass suicide was a 14-page note that the police found believed to be written by Crithika. An excerpt from the note goes as follows "" I do not know what is married life… I have a son and I have always to look for money for him… I put an end to my life and the nine persons who have followed me and who have suffered like me.."" The note further went into her financial issues and how no one would lend her any money and that she had even tried resorting to prostitution. The wording of the note in its entirety was quite vague and it wasn't clear whether it was referring to a mass suicide or if it was mass poisoning with Crithika killing herself afterwards.

Meanwhile, the police tried solving the mystery of the unidentified 10th corpse however this avenue of investigation would lead to more questions than answers. The body belonged to a man around 50 years of age and next to his body was a backpack containing two identification cards and a ring with the initials ""HJ"". The identification cards however despite having the same photograph and face both had different names the first being Hervé Janvier and the other bearing the name Mr. Labonté. Hervé had been a wanted man since November 2002, after he escaped from prison. Hervé's body was identified by his wife via his clothing and jewelry but due to the advanced decomposition positive identification was made impossible and the police theorized that his death could've been faked. Hervé and his accomplice Antoine Chetty were both convicted for fraud and the illegal sale of land and properties. Antoine had stated that he didn't believe Hervé would commit suicide stating that he was too intelligent to do so. Furthermore, Hervé was considered by police to be a master of disguise who had used several fake names and alias to throw the police off. A resident also reported sighting him on a beach in the days before the discovery of the bodies which would complicate matters considerably due to the rate of decomposition. Hervé also had no link to the other bodies and the room he was found in was locked from the outside. Also when looking into the second ID that of Mr. Labonté the police were unable to find any missing person reports by that name. Eventually, the testimony and identification by Hervé's wife was deemed unreliable and the officially the 10th corpse remains unidentified.

The police arrested two people possibly involved. The two are a policeman named Bhupendra Auckraj and a homeless man Jeetendra Janghee they were arrested for forgery and fraud as found inside the home were plots of land fraudulently sold to one of the victims under the alias of Franck Marion. It seems that despite this however they had nothing to do with the actual deaths of the 10 individuals and were simply charged with fraud. I am however unable to find a follow up and any information on their possible trials.

The police looked into the backgrounds of the other victims with Mala Jhowry before her death having reported to the police that she was leaving her husband due to conflicts and taking herself and their two children to their grandmother, This happened on July 22. Her husband was briefly questioned and he was baffled by this turn of events denying that there had ever been any issues in their marriage that would cause something like this and when the police contacted Mala's mother they learned that she and her children never showed up. Mala and Crithika had both met at a salon and soon became business partners. Mala's husband doesn't believe that their two children would commit suicide

Meanwhile, the police continued to examine the home and determined that no one had left the house as combined with every entrance and exit being locked and the keys to the house found inside and no signs of forced entry were noted such as broken windows or signs of any damage to the locks. Meanwhile, with the exception of the ten decomposing corpses, the house was remarkably tidy. Everything was in its proper place, neat and all the kitchen utensils were clean.

The police also wondered how the relatives of the victims never reported them as missing. This however is one of the few questions that would be answered. The neighbours on Béchard Lane stated that they weren't concerned over the absence of the residents of the home as they were also not very outgoing and they rarely saw them, to begin with. As for their surviving relatives, they told the police that they were contacted by them and stated that they planned on going on a trip to the Mauritian island of Rodrigues and thus they didn't report them missing because they thought they knew where they were. According to reports, Mala's husband did head over to Béchard Lane on three separate occasions but after being stopped by the locked gate he decided to just go home unaware that the bodies of his wife and two children were lying dead inside that house.

Rajesh Dhayam was the only one of the dead to have his disappearance reported to the police and there was a little controversy regarding it as his relatives told the police that he may be staying at Béchard Lane and on August 17, the police accompanied some of his relatives to the home but the police at the time did not deem it fit to break down the door and enter the home. Since the coroner estimated that the time of death was August 20, it's was, therefore, possible that on that day Rajesh may have still been alive and thus Rajesh's family were considering suing the police for not entering the home which could've possibly saved Rajesh's life. They however decided against this likely due to August 20, being the date of death was simply just an estimate and not a confirmed fact.

There were two surviving members of Crithika's family however with her sister Rumila being one of them and Rumila tragically had lost her entire family as a result of this incident save for her children and husband. She said that Crithika was a strange woman even when she was young. Crithika as a child would often predict when visitors mainly relatives would arrive at their home to visit and she was correct about these predictions a fair number of times. Before this incident, Crithika would call Rumila and told her in Creole ""One day you will hear..in history..what types of great works your sister has accomplished. I always told you I am a goddess, no one believed me. I am going very far, forget that you have a sister named Critika. Critika said strange things like ""if I cry, it will rain"" or ""God talks to me"" She also stated that she had a strange vibe and that people would behave differently around her. Rumila doesn't believe that this was a mass suicide and stated that she believed an 11th person is involved.

Ravi Mawooa one of the dead and Critika's brothers also made some strange statements in the days leading up to his death. He said to one of his relatives ""We are following a meditation course which will help us elevate ourselves. People beneath us are demons"" and called his wife who was residing at her mother's due to pregnancy and told her not to contact him for the next 15 days as he'd be in ""deep meditation"". His neighbours reported that before his disappearance he appeared normal and went to work every day.

Ashok Nundkoomar who was the ex-husband of Critika was also interviewed and he described Critika as ""manipulative"" ""authoritarian"" and ""demanding"" They both met in college and married a few years later. After a failed pregnancy the couple tried again and Critika gave birth to Devesh in 1993 or 1994. She often complained about abdominal pain and occasionally suffer from a swollen face. Ashok testified that she would visit several doctors but they were unable to provide effective treatment. One day she ended up buying a Crystal Ball and brought it home with her and this was when their marriage began to deteriorate. It was around this time that Critika started to involve herself in religious rites and sects. She said that meditation with the Crystal Ball helped with her pain and enabled her to talk to god. She would frequently isolate herself in that room with the ball and refused to let anyone enter while she was inside and would sometimes wake up at 3:00 AM to go to that room to meditate much to Ashok's annoyance. Eventually, Ashok found the key to that specific room and locked it. Not long after Critika left with Devesh to go live with her mother telling Ashok ""this house is not made for me"" Critika was also the leader of a Hindu prayer group. Ashok stated that he was certain that Critika had written that suicide note but was at a loss to explain who Critika brought her son into the mass suicide plot. His son Devesh was last seen on August 16 where he was spotted riding a bike.

It was believed that her controlling behaviour may have come from her father Deoduth who Rumila described as abusive and distant. He was very controlling over his family including his wife and children with Rumila and Critika often called him ""The Dictator"" or even ""Hitler""

The police also speculated that Mala and Critika were having an affair and in a secret relationship. People who knew the two stated that they appeared to be more than just friends and Mala would often praise Critika and talk about her frequently. Furthermore, in the suicide note, Mala is referred to as ""Princess"" or ""Honey"" and stated that she had become disillusioned with Rajesh. Mala's husband stated that he didn't believe they were in a romantic or sexual relationship but felt that their friendship might've been controlling or abusive as Mala would try and hide her communications with Critika. The day Mala abruptly left her husband and informed the police that she was moving in with her mother happened on a day when her husband wasn't home.

The relatives and neighbours all testified and gave statements to a magistrate in private and a report was sent to the prosecution however the report was never made public and despite the massive nature of the case the police simply ran out of leads and were unable to investigate further.

The two main theories are that the case is either a mass murder committed by Critka who promptly took her own life or it was a case of mass suicide. Although the true version of events is unknown.

Adding to the mystery is how the identity of the tenth corpse has never been accurately determined leaving him unidentified and thus an oddity amongst the mass suicide or murder of two families.

Not only that but all the money that had been withdrawn by the dead before the suicide has never been found and the police don't know why it was withdrawn.

Elisabeth Frances membrey was born June 6th 1972 and disappeared on December 6th 1994 age 22 years, Elisabeth was last seen alive at the Manhattan Hotel December 6th 1994 at 11:45pm no trace of her as ever been found, Elisabeth would now be 49 years old or 50 as of June 6th.   Elisabeth, (liz) was my best friend for almost a decade before her disappearance. She meant the world. She was the best friend anyone could ever ask for, she was like family a sister I never had.  Growing up from silly teens to starting our adult life moving out of our families homes on the same road working at the same bar. Liz deserves to come home! The girl who was always smiling and laughing. She made a ever lasting impression on everyone. If I never met her I wouldn’t be who I am today. She made me a better person she made life feel full and complete.   Liz was the most positive person you’d ever meet, I wasn’t as positive I often felt like giving up on getting my dream job I thought I was going to be stuck working at the Manhattan forever, her words were “never give up on your dreams” I didn’t and In November 1994 I got my dream job! She was so happy for me she got to see me have my dream come true I never got to see her get hers. She only got 22 short years here but she lived her life to the fullest, she tried so hard for everything she ever wanted. She truly loved life. I’ve never met anyone who genuinely loved life like she did. She never gave up on her dreams. She never gave up on me she was always there for me. My life fell apart when she vanished my best friend I ever had gone.. even 27 years later I still can’t forget her gorgeous face, those years were some of the best in my life the memories we had will stick with me forever. She was a positive kind caring intelligent graceful angel sent straight from heaven. She was put here to bring joy and make life better but she left in the cruelest way possible. Liz and I never ever broke a promise.. but one.. the one where we’d be there to see each other get our dream jobs and have a family. Joking we’d be Aunty liz and Aunty ash. Always be there for each other no matter what. That was a promise I never intended to break a promise that meant everything. Unfortunately life was so cruel as to take that promise away from us. Liz May be gone but I’m not and for as long as I live my goal is to bring her home. I’ll never give up on her. It’s the least I can do. She made my life better she was my non blooded sister. And her parents were the kindest people you’d ever meet, to meeting them with Liz introducing me to them for the first time to seeing them cry as their daughters accused killer walks free. That was the last time I’d ever see them their devastated faces forever ingrained in my mind. The Membrey’s are a gorgeous family a family that was like my extended family. I’ve always felt guilty I got live my life and she didn’t. That guilt I still have even after all theses years. If you have someone like liz in your life you’ll understand just how much they mean.  After 27 years it’s long enough I’m begging I’m praying I’m asking for someone anyone to come forward.   I’m here appealing for anyone to come forward with information on her disappearance.

128,TheKrystalSkye24x,[],1641837263,"I have recently watched the documentary on netflix and would like to add my thoughts onto this thread. I have been researching for hours on reddit and noone else (to my knowledge) has come up with the theory I have established. 

I would first like to state that I am currently in my 2nd year of mental health nursing so do have some knowledge to back up my thoughts around Mr Bailey.

To start, I truly beleive that Mr Bailey suffers from a mental illness. His behaviour meets someone who may have a split personality disorder or something similar. I beleive he may have autistic traits also.  Baileys disorder may be triggered (or heightened) through consuming alcohol. This could also be related to his aggression towards his former partner when under the influence. He simply loses control of himself but when sober seems to talk about himself as another person/third person. I do not beleive Bailey committed the murder but I do beleive he was involved (hence why he had scratches on his arms, tried to get rid of his clothes/wash them etc) and had knowledge of the murder as well as knowing other details. I think in a way, he liked the attention from saying he did the crime when under the influence but then when sober rejects all knowledge. If he didn't do the crime, then only someone who knew the killer or was involved with the crime would know alot of the details he did, act the way he did and have the physical marks. 

I beleive the suspect may actually be closer to home for Sophie. My theory is that it was actually Alfie Lyons - the house next to Sophies. 

It was well known that Sophie and Alfie had regular disputes. There Is a lot we don't know about Sophie in general. She was quite a private person when in Ireland. There could be a lot of missing information regarding Sophie, the quarrels with neighbours etc. 

The fact that Sophie ran away from her house and not towards Alfies is odd. If I felt I was in danger then I would run to my neighbour. Not down a long country track that is miles long heading to nowhere. I have looked on Google maps and the main road was a long long walk away. The only reason to not run to your neighbour is that it's because they are the ones attacking you or you feel they wouldn't help you in such a situation due to their disliking to you. They also knocked on her back door, not front. The backdoor joins onto the drive of Alfies house.

Bailey previously on that evening (I beleive) had driven near Sophies and stated that he felt something bad was going to happen there. Maybe Bailey and Alfie were closer than we know and Alfie had told Bailey in conversation that he was going to confront Sophie that night (maybe over the disputes or something else we don't know) and maybe Bailey knew a different side to Alfie. Maybe Alfie had aggressive tendencies just like Bailey did - maybe they saw eye to eye in this aspect and got on well from it. 

I beleive that Alfie committed the murder... a heated conversation gone wrong or something that went too far. The fact that the murder was SO unusally aggressive is a red flag for me. This person was absolutely intent on killing Sophie. A lot of murders will go down the route of strangulation and leave it at that. Sophies head was bashed in with a concrete block and her skull was exposed at the crime scene. Aswell as severe breakages to her upper body. I beleive the concrete block was used several times to omit this damage. The killer definitely wanted her dead and definitely had a lot of aggression released during this killing. Was there things we didn't know about Sophie that would enlighten such rage in someone? A nice good looking French girl in the Irish countryside does not just have her skull bashed in with a concrete block for no reason. 

I believe Alfie committed it and maybe confided in Bailey shortly after. I beleive Bailey came to the scene to help Alfie clean up any evidence (possibly) and maybe discuss about what will happen next, what time to report the body etc etc . Bailey was an educated man and I think Alfie would confide in someone like that for help and advice. This would explain why Bailey would still want to get rid of clothing items etc etc as he would have been in touch with the crime scene. Alfie was reported to have a bandage on his hand from a dog bite but this could of been related to the murder. 

I find it odd that there is no photos of Alfie, no interview shown on the documentary despite them living right beside Sophies house. We truly don't know who this man is, his intentions, his behaviour, his history, or what he was capable of. Sometimes murders are alot closer to home than we think. 

Bailey with his personality and possible mental illness flourished off this drama.. something happening in the area for him to write about. His personality is the type to get overly fixated on things. He is clearly an overimaginative person with a creative mind - in certain states he might have convinced even himself that he had done it - hence his strange outbursts. 

I think that the killer knew they would get away with it due to how rural the area is, the police were not used to things like this, they probably knew that Sophie kept herself private so gaining information would be difficult from others. They were able to kill her with what was around them leaving little to no evidence. Also probably aware that DNA / blood testing was limited at this time. 

I think there is a lot of missing information and the fact the police were quite laid back with the investigation doesn't help. Were they paid off by someone wealthy? In rural areas like this, it wouldn't surprise me if police would take a bribe and just blame it all on the known crazy village man - Bailey.

Recently Bailey has come out and said he thinks the killer is dead. This would rise true to my theory as Alfie is indeed dead now.

129,Texas_Monthly,[],1641832944,"The mysterious disappearance and death of Canadian, Texas, high schooler Tom Brown was the subject of our podcast series, Tom Brown's Body, which premiered in 2020. 

To recap: 

In 2016, the popular teenager disappeared in the tiny Panhandle community of Canadian, Texas. Two years later, his remains were discovered beneath a tree outside of town. But to this day, no arrests have been made, and nearly everyone involved in the case has fallen under suspicion, including the local sheriff and the boy's family. In the final episode, we learned that a grand jury would be convened to hear testimony about Tom's death. 

Now, a ninth episode from host Skip Hollandsworth reveals new information on the case from private investigator Philip Klein, a new witness, and lead investigator Rachel Kading.

130,bizzbuzzbizzbuzz,[],1641832282,"On August 27, 2006, 2 year-old [Trenton Duckett](https://imgur.com/52S1jpB) disappeared without a trace from his bedroom in Leesburg, Florida. Trenton’s mother, 21 year-old [Melinda Duckett](https://imgur.com/Or307Zk), told police that she put Trenton to bed around 7:00 pm that evening, and, when she went into his room to check on him a couple of hours later, her son was missing and the screen to his bedroom window in their ground-floor apartment had been cut. 

Melinda quickly became the prime suspect in her son's disappearance, but no physical evidence has ever linked her to the crime. Prior to his disappearance, Trenton's life had been one marked by upheaval and turbulence, and the sheer amount of rumors, accusations, and lack of evidence make this case a particularly frustrating one.

It’s been over 15 years since that night, and no trace of Trenton Duckett has ever been found. 

**A Turbulent Relationship**

Trenton was born on August 10, 2004 to Melinda Duckett (neé Eubank) and [Joshua Duckett](https://imgur.com/UBitNT4). Melinda moved to Florida when she was 17 years-old to live with her adoptive grandparents, who resided in [The Villages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Villages,_Florida). Melinda was born in South Korea and adopted by American parents when she was four months old, and she spent most of her childhood in Lockport, New York, just a few miles from the Canadian border.

Melinda met Josh Duckett shortly after moving to Florida. They started dating when they were both [students at South Sumter High School](https://imgur.com/FHpD5HK); Melinda got pregnant while they were still in high school, and Trenton was born shortly after they graduated. Their relationship was incredibly volatile, and the two broke up in April 2005. Soon after Josh moved out, he contacted the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), alleging that Melinda threatened to harm Trenton unless Josh came over to her house to talk to her. DCF investigated these claims, but found no evidence of them, and Trenton remained in his mother's care.

At the end of the month, Josh and his mother had Melinda [Baker Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Act)ed, an action that immediately removed Trenton from Melinda’s care and placed in his father’s custody. It was later determined that Josh and his mother had knowingly manipulated the Bushnell, Florida police chief (a friend of their family) into approving the Baker Act by having Josh call Melinda on speakerphone while in the presence of the police chief. At one point in the conversation, Melinda used the phrase “end it,” which Josh and his mother claimed was a threat of suicide. The police chief admitted that Melinda didn’t specify what she wanted to end or how she would end it, but she still approved the use of the Baker Act against Melinda to have her involuntarily committed. Melinda had to undergo multiple psychiatric evaluations, but was released as psychiatrists found no evidence that she was a threat to herself or anyone else.

Melinda and Josh (alongside his mother) battled for custody of Trenton throughout May 2005, with Melinda completing court-ordered case plans, and Josh again alleging that Melinda threatened to harm Trenton (as with the previous allegations, DCF could not verify these claims). Then, in June 2005, Josh signed an [affidavit](https://imgur.com/w0cwRKb) stating that the allegations he previously made against Melinda were false and were made at the urging of his mother, who wanted custody of Trenton. Josh also stated that he believed Melinda should be given full custody of Trenton. The next month, July 2005, Melinda and Josh suddenly eloped. In August 2005, Josh attempted to file a restraining order against his mother on the basis of harassment and bullying.

For a couple of months, things seemed to stabilize between Josh and Melinda. And then, on October 30, 2005, the two got into an argument. Josh also alleged that, during this argument, Melinda held a knife to Trenton and threatened to kill him (Melinda again denied these claims). DCF performed a home study and, though they did not find any evidence that Trenton had been threatened or physically harmed, removed Trenton from his parents’ care due to the continued volatility of his parents’ relationship, which DCF felt could result in harm to Trenton. He was placed in foster care and then, a few days later, temporary custody was granted to Melinda’s grandparents.

In November 2005, both Josh and Melinda were court-ordered to complete DCF case plans and undergo psychological evaluations in order to regain custody of Trenton. Melinda completed the case plan (including parenting classes) and underwent and passed all the psych evals; Josh, meanwhile, did not complete the case plan, abandoned the parenting classes, and also violated a court order. Because of this, in November 2005, Melinda was awarded custody of Trenton while Josh was granted unsupervised visitations with his son. DCF continued their observations of Trenton throughout the beginning of 2006, eventually closing the case and recommending that Melinda retain custody of Trenton with Josh allowed unsupervised visitation. In June 2006, Melinda filed for divorce from Josh.

On July 3, 2006, Melinda contacted law enforcement and said that Josh had sent her a [MySpace message](https://imgur.com/7asjjfe) that threatened to kill both her and Trenton. Melinda used this message to file a temporary restraining order against Josh on July 5. Josh denied writing the message and claimed that Melinda had access to his MySpace login and password; as of November 2006, police believe that the message likely was written by Melinda, not Josh.

**Trenton’s Disappearance**

On the evening of Sunday, August 27, 2006, Melinda claimed that she put Trenton to bed in his room in their apartment in Windemere Villas. She then invited two friends over to watch a movie; when she went to check on Trenton after the movie was over, he was gone. One of Melinda’s friends called 911 around 9:00 pm, and Melinda spoke to dispatchers, telling them that her son was missing.

When the police arrived at 9:19 pm, they found that Trenton was missing and that the screen to his bedroom window had been slashed, but not much else. Forensic examinations of the slashed window screen from Trenton’s bedroom were inconclusive. Investigators could not determine if the screen had been slashed from inside or outside the room, and they could also not identify the object that made the cut. 

When speaking to police, Melinda implied to police that she felt her estranged husband, Josh, might have been responsible for Trenton’s disappearance, but authorities found no evidence that this was the case. Josh took a polygraph test, which he passed; Melinda failed a voice stress test and refused to take a polygraph on the advice of her lawyer. Suspicion quickly turned to Melinda, the last person to see Trenton alive. The last confirmed sighting of Trenton Duckett by anyone other than his mother occurred the day before he went missing, on Saturday, August 26 at about 4:00 pm when Melinda picked him up from her grandparents' house. Police worked to determine the whereabouts of both Melinda and Trenton after she picked him up from her grandparents’ house in the hopes that this could provide some clues about what happened to Trenton, but they have been able to confirm very little about where Melinda and Trenton were from 4:00 pm on Saturday until 7:00 pm on Sunday.

According to Melinda, on Sunday, August 27, she wanted to shoot target practice with a 20-gauge shotgun she had recently purchased. So she decided to take Trenton and the gun to a shooting range near Farles Lake in the Ocala National Forest. Except, Melinda said, she got lost, and she and Trenton never actually made it to the forest. Instead, she said, she and Trenton spent hours driving around Central Florida, stopping at both the TD Waterhouse Center (now called the Amway Center) in downtown Orlando and the Altamonte Mall in Altamonte Springs. Police checked video surveillance in both of these locations, but were unable to find any evidence that Melinda and Trenton were there on August 27.

**The Prime Suspect**

Melinda quickly became the prime suspect in the case, but she vehemently denied any involvement in Trenton’s disappearance. On September 7, 2006, just over a week after Trenton went missing, Nancy Grace invited Melinda to be interviewed on her TV show. During the interview, Grace strongly insinuated that Melinda had killed Trenton, badgering her with questions about Trenton’s disappearance, and accusing her of hiding something. Grace also pointed to Melinda’s refusal to take a lie detector test as proof of her guilt.

Then, on September 8, 2006, 13 days after Trenton went missing and the day the *Nancy Grace* episode was slated to air, Melinda died by suicide, shooting herself in the closet of her grandparents’ home with her grandfather’s shotgun. Melinda left three separate suicide notes: one addressed to her [parents](https://imgur.com/lgbcWYk), one to her grandparents ([page 1](https://imgur.com/gy7bhB4), [page 2](https://imgur.com/3XynQsA)), and one to the public ([page 1](https://imgur.com/CSkilco), [page 2](https://imgur.com/45ghcge)).

Melinda’s family sued Nancy Grace, arguing that Grace had badgered Melinda, a grieving young mother in the midst of unbelievable stress, into ending her own life. Grace argued that she held no responsibility for Melinda’s death and it was more likely Melinda killed herself over the guilt of killing Trenton. The case was eventually settled out of court, with CNN agreeing to make a $200,000 payment to establish the Trenton Duckett Trust with the money being used to fund additional searches for Trenton. (Melinda was not the only Nancy Grace guest who committed suicide after being blamed for killing her child. In 2012, Grace demanded that a woman who had charged with manslaughter after drinking vodka and rolling over on her sleeping baby be charged with murder; this woman, Toni Medrano, also died by suicide a few days after Nancy Grace segment aired.)

About a week after Melinda’s suicide, police issued a statement identifying her as the primary suspect in Trenton’s disappearance. However, they also stated that they didn’t believe that Melinda had harmed Trenton. Authorities also said that they had enough evidence to arrest Melinda only four days after her son went missing, but that they held off on arresting her in the hopes that she would lead them to Trenton. Police later revealed the arrest warrant they were going to issue was for charges unrelated to Trenton’s disappearance. In fact, in 2011, Leesburg Police Detective Brian Cash stated that, “There's just no evidence. Some will argue that he was killed. Some will argue that he was maybe handed off. When I look at the case, I see a missing kid with no real good explanation to what happened to him.”

**Evidence, Leads, and Sightings**

Despite Melinda’s claims that she and Trenton never made it to the Ocala National Forest, there were a couple of alleged sightings of Melinda and Trenton in the forest on August 27. While none of these sightings were confirmed, police believed they were credible enough to begin searching areas of the forest. But despite numerous searches of the forest, including both the Farles Lake area and another area where there was an alleged sighting of Melinda and Trenton, no trace of Trenton has been found.

There was another lead that investigators found credible enough to investigate and release to the public: a construction worker claimed he saw a well-dressed Asian or Hispanic couple in their late 50s or early 60s, driving a silver or light gold Cadillac Escalade, possibly with New York plates, talking to Melinda and Trenton at a construction site on Aug. 17, ten days before Trenton went missing. The witness also stated there was a black or blue-colored bag on the hood of Melinda’s car. The NY plates were especially interesting to police, since Melinda’s parents still resided in NY. The construction site was located on US 27, near an entrance to the Florida Turnpike. Police dug up the construction site after Trenton disappeared, but nothing related to Trenton’s disappearance was found. Melinda’s parents told police they did not know any couples who matched the description and did not know anyone who drove a silver or gold Escalade.

In September 2006, a witness came forward who claimed to have seen Melinda and Trenton at a Wendy’s restaurant in Belleview, Florida the day he disappeared (Belleview is located between Leesburg and Ocala). According to the witness (who worked at the Wendy’s), Melinda and Trenton went through the drive thru at about 11:30am that morning; Melinda allegedly returned about 30 minutes later without Trenton. There was another possible sighting of Melinda later that day at the restaurant at around 4:00 pm. As with the other sightings, none of these have been confirmed.

Police *were* able to confirm (using credit card and ATM records) two locations that Melinda visited between 4:00 pm August 26 and 7:00 pm August 27  – she purchased gas at a BP station just south of Leesburg around 5:25 pm on August 26, and withdrew $40 from an ATM in Leesburg at 10:50 am on August 27. It is unknown if Trenton was with her at either location, and while police have numerous alleged sightings (some of just Melinda, some of Melinda and Trenton together), none have been confirmed.

Police also released records that showed that Melinda’s cell pinged off towers in various places in Central Florida between noon and 4:00 pm on Sunday, August 27. Unfortunately, using these kinds of pings to identify the exact location of where a call was made is not reliable evidence (using pings isn’t the same as using GPS data linked to a smartphone, which can give exact locations). For example, the first call Melinda made (at 12:08 pm) pinged off a tower near the Paddock Mall in Ocala, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that Melinda was at or in the immediate vicinity of the Paddock Mall at that time. In fact, all of the calls pinged towers located between Ocala and Orlando, so it’s possible that these towers could have been pinged if Melinda was indeed, as she claimed, driving around Central Florida that day. (More information about the faulty science of using cell phone ping data to pinpoint a person’s exact location can be found in [this article.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-your-cell-phone-cant-tell-the-police))

One of the major issues with this case is that there is no actual physical evidence of what happened to Trenton. The police did find that the window screen in Trenton’s bedroom had been cut, but they were not able to determine if it had been cut from the inside or outside of the apartment. The police were able to determine that the MySpace message Melinda claimed Josh sent to her threatening to kill both her and Trenton wasn’t written by Josh–and they believed it may indeed have written by Melinda herself–but even that isn’t evidence that she did anything to Trenton (especially given the history of Josh and Melinda falsely accusing each other of abusive/threatening behavior).

The most damning evidence against Melinda (in addition to having been the last person to see Trenton alive) is that, the day after she reported Trenton missing, police found some of Trenton’s toys, baby pictures, and a sonogram image in a trash bin at Melinda’s apartment complex. Police say that these findings are what made them originally take a closer look at Melinda; however, it was not able to be proven that these items were put into the garbage by Melinda. Additionally, searches of Melinda’s apartment also found the she had numerous keepsakes and photos of Trenton in the home, and his room remained filled with toys and clothes after he went missing.

**So Where is Trenton?**

Despite continued investigations by police, there have been few developments in Trenton’s case in the past 15 years. While Melinda remains the prime suspect, there is no actual evidence implicating her in Trenton’s disappearance. In addition to the pictures and toys found in the trash bin at her apartment complex, authorities point to her failing a voice stress test and her refusing to take a polygraph as evidence that she was involved, but both of these tools are junk science. Melinda was obviously troubled and struggling, but it is also difficult to know which (if any) of the DCF complaints filed against Melinda were true, as they all came from Josh and his mother, both of whom have admitted to making false allegations against Melinda. As far as I can tell from the various DCF documents that have been published online in this case, there were never any findings that Melinda ever physically harmed or threatened Trenton. In fact, the DCF case reports ([page 1](https://imgur.com/Bsx08oq), [page 2](https://imgur.com/cDUUZqV)) that I could find state that Trenton was healthy and seemed secure and happy in his mother’s care. Furthermore, despite multiple searches of Melinda’s home, car, and personal effects (including her diary), there is no evidence that connects her to Trenton’s disappearance.

Josh has been the dominant voice in the case for 15 years (for obvious reasons) and has fully cooperated with investigators, including taking a polygraph, which he passed. However, his behavior towards both Melinda and Trenton in the two years before Trenton disappeared is troubling. Josh and his mother made repeated false allegations to DCF against Melinda. It seems that most of these allegations were made at the behest of Josh’s mother, who disliked Melinda and wanted custody of Trenton. Josh also didn’t complete the DCF case plan and parenting classes required to regain custody of his son after Trenton was placed in foster care. Prior to his disappearance, Trenton was mostly cared for by Melinda, his maternal great-grandparents, and his paternal grandmother; Josh seemed to be a fairly absent and uninterested father until his son disappeared. 

One possibility that seems to have been mostly ignored by investigators in the case is a stranger abduction. Police have said that Trenton being taken by someone outside the family was “unlikely” but there is no information as to why this is the case. While stranger abductions are rare, they are not impossible, so I do wonder if this angle was fully investigated before Melinda became the prime–and only–suspect in the case. Melinda and Trenton lived in an end unit, ground floor apartment. Trenton’s bedroom window was at the back of the apartment; directly behind the apartment was a dirt access road that leads to a gas station on US 441, a major highway. Police did acknowledge that the cut made in Trenton’s window screen was large enough for someone to reach through the window to grab Trenton, but they said they felt this was unlikely (although, they have never explained why they didn't think it was likely).

In many ways, Melinda is the easy suspect. There is a long list of allegations against her filed with DCF, she was a teenage mother, suffered from mental health issues (she had been diagnosed with OCD) and an outsider in a rural community. And yet, none of these things are evidence that she is responsible for her son's disappearance. Police relied heavily on junk science (polygraphs and voice stress tests) and unsubstantiated witness sightings to make their case. They also claim they could have arrested Melinda, but instead decided to wait it out and see if she could lead them to Trenton (again, despite not having any evidence that she knew where Trenton was). It is unclear what, if any, investigations were undertaken to determine if Trenton could have been abducted by a stranger or another unknown person.

**Additional Information**

In addition to the above information, there are a number of other strange/interesting elements of this case. Most of this information has been dismissed by law enforcement as being related to Trenton’s disappearance, but it’s often brought up in discussions around the case so I wanted to include it here as well:

* Shortly after Melinda Duckett’s death, police discovered that she had been making amateur pornography. At least one of these videos featured a baby crying in the background; Josh Duckett also appears in at least one of these videos.
* James “Jimmy” Duckett, a former Mascotte, FL police officer and Josh Duckett’s father, is currently on death row in Florida. In 1988, he was convicted of raping, strangling, and drowning an 11 year-old girl. He was already in prison on death row in Florida when Trenton was born. Trenton visited his grandfather in prison and Melinda kept a written correspondence with James Duckett.
* A number of people believe that Melinda’s death is suspicious and may not have been suicide (though there have been no findings from law enforcement that support this). Most of these claims are based on the fact that the gun was fired twice inside the closet where she died.
* Prior to Trenton’s disappearance, Melinda told friends that she wanted to learn more about her biological family and was hoping to connect Trenton to his roots. Some people believe that Melinda sent Trenton to Korea to live with relatives prior to her death, though police could find no evidence that Trenton ever left the country.

**Fifteen Years, and Still No Answers**

It has been over 15 years since two year-old Trenton Duckett vanished from his bedroom in Leesburg, FL. No trace of him has been found. Police have also not released any evidence that implicates Melinda–or anyone else–in Trenton’s disappearance. If he is alive today, he would be 17 years old; in 2019, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an [age-progressed image](https://imgur.com/Fnblcrd) of what Trenton may look like if he is alive. Anyone with information concerning Trenton’s disappearance or whereabouts is urged to call 800-CALL-FBI or 800-423-TIPS.

132,xxlilituxx,[],1641812756,"Stuart Pearce (33yo), Meredith (31 years) and their four children, Adam (11 years), Travis (9 years) Matthew (8 years) and Kerry (2 years) lived in a quiet house on Jackson Street, Parafield Gardens, in the North Western suburbs of Adelaide. 

Saturday the 5th of January 1991 was a day like any other. After having dinner and putting the kids to bed, around 9pm, Meredith Pearce took a phone call from her sister. She made sure to speak quietly as her husband slept before starting his midnight shift at Wingfield BP fuel station. While Meredith chatted with her sister, she gave no indication that anything was wrong or that she and her family were under any threat. 

Apparently everything was fine, as Stuart followed his usual routine when doing a midnight shift, which was to wake up around 10pm, have a meal, shower then drive the roughly 15 minutes to Wingfield to start his midnight shift.

The next morning, on Sunday the 6th of January 1991, Metropolitan Fire Service was called to the Pearce family home to find it ablaze. The fire had been reported at 7:17am, Stuart’s nightshift ended at 6:50am. The bodies of Meredith, and three of their three children, Adam, Travis, and Kerry, were found after the fire was extinguished. Matthew, luckily, had spent the night at a friend’s house. 

Meredith Pearce was found in her bedroom tied to a chair, she had a towel stuffed in her mouth, and was strangled with an electrical cord. The media reported that Adam and Travis had also been tied to chairs and had been asphyxiated by having plastic bags cover their heads. 2-year-old Kerry was reported to have been smothered to death. Autopsies revealed the family had died before the fire had been lit.

Police speculate that Stuart murdered his family before going to work. During their investigations, it was revealed that gas bottles had been set around the house on the night prior to the fire, but these failed to explode. Police suspect that Pearce returned home after his night shift and used other accelerants around the house to set the fire, before fleeing to dump his car.

Stuart’s distinctive white 240K Datsun coupe was found dumped at Arndale shopping Centre in Kilkenny, which is around 13km (8 miles) from the family home (and 4.9km [3 miles] from his workplace). Meredith’s blood was found in the boot of the car and on a door trim. Police believe that her blood was most likely transferred to the car from Stuart.

A Police search of the property during their investigation revealed that Stuart Pearce’s .303 rifle was missing. It also uncovered a bunker, which was being used to conceal a drug crop of 25 marijuana plants.

Stuart Pearce remains the main suspect in the murder of his family. Over the years, the only survivor, Matthew, who lost his entire family in one night, has been interviewed by police. He denies having any knowledge of his father’s whereabouts. Matthew told The Advertiser newspaper, in 2002 that he believed his father was innocent. Matthew has fallen into a lifestyle of Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, drugs, and crime, which is heartbreaking, but trauma can make life so difficult.

Brevet Sergeant Bob Sharpe, from the SAPOL Major Crime Investigation Branch says that there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that Stuart Pearce was responsible for the deaths of his wife and children.

""Whether he's been able to go into hiding for so many years, or whether he's taken his own life when he's realised what he's done, are the two more likely options police have to consider.""

""Over the years a number of sightings have come in -local, interstate, and overseas- all of which have been thoroughly investigated""

""In most cases police have been able to identify the people and prove who they were before 1991, so they're not Stuart Pearce.""

""It would be very difficult for someone to live off the grid for this length of time -we have his fingerprints, plus a DNA profile, and he's the subject of an Interpol red notice, but he hasn't come to our attention."" he said.

“I don’t think there was a great degree of pre-planning in relation to this matter - Mrs Pearce certainly gave no indication of any concerns in that phone call and that might explain why one child was not at the house.""

“My feeling is that he’s committed this terrible act, tried to shift blame on to someone else by deliberately dumping his car in a particular location, but when that hasn’t worked he’s taken his own life and we just haven’t found his body yet.""

“However, we certainly don’t rule out other possibilities and every piece of evidence or report that comes in is thoroughly investigated.”

Stuart Pearce has been missing for 31 years and would now be 64 years old, at the time of his disappearance he was described as a medium build, with brown hair and fair complexion. He had several distinctive tattoos, including a naked woman with a rose on her back on his upper right arm, and a red and green rose over a Maltese Cross on his lower left leg, but it's possible he's had them removed or altered. His date of birth is July 1, 1957. 
Stuart Pearce’s last known whereabouts was Parafield Gardens in South Australia, however by now he could be anywhere in the world.

A reward of up to $1 million dollars has been offered for information leading to the apprehension and/or conviction of the person, or people, responsible for the suspected murders.

amath County, Ore. — After four decades, detectives with the [Klamath County Sheriff’s Office](https://ktvl.com/news/local/kcso-arrests-former-deputy-for-unlawful-marijuana-manufacturing) solved a double homicide cold case with the help of DNA technology and genetic genealogy.

In 1978, the remains of Cynthia Frayer and Kirk Wiseman were found after they were [shot to death](https://ktvl.com/news/nation-world/texas-father-fatally-shot-in-chuck-e-cheese-parking-lot-carrying-daughters-birthday-cake-humble-calogero-duenes-amber-uresti-bday-child-dad-corpus-christi) in a wooded area near [Lake of the Woods ](https://ktvl.com/news/local/lake-of-the-woods-resort-lodge-gets-ready-to-celebrate-its-first-christmas-holiday)after hitchhiking their way from Eugene to Klamath County.

“I would love to say it’s just another case, but it’s not,” said Detective Dan Towery. “I am just lucky enough to be the last one in the chair to take it across the goal line.""

Volume 90%*KTVL*

Towery said the case was first investigated by now-retired Sheriff Carl Burkhart, who at the time did not have access to the latest technology, but was able to preserve crucial evidence that was eventually used to find the suspect.  


In 2018, articles of Cynthia's clothing were sent to a crime lab, where technicians recovered the DNA of an unknown male.

When the initial testing didn't yield any positive, pre-existing matches, the samples were then sent to Parabon. Parabon is a company that uses DNA technology and genetic genealogy, which helped law enforcement finally solve the cold case.

The chief genealogist at Parabon analyzed the samples and eventually gave Klamath County law enforcement a viable suspect name, Ray Whitson Jr. It was quickly discovered that Whitson Jr. died back in 1996.

Because the prime suspect is deceased, the case is now considered ""suspended.""

Towery said that the case was always on his mind, and now that it is officially suspended, he can finally give evidence to the victims’ families.

""There's a letter from Cynthia to her mom and dad a few days prior, it was never mailed, it talked about what they were doing in Washington, talked about their hopes and dreams, and never got mailed,” Towery said “I am going to give it to her mom.""

Howard Wiseman, father of Kirk Wiseman, said his family always felt a dark cloud over them because of all the unanswered questions surrounding Kirk and his girlfriend's death.

""I want to congratulate the Klamath County Sheriff’s department. They went way above and beyond the call of duty in closing this case for us family members,” Wiseman said.

Wiseman said that while the family can finally be at peace knowing who killed the two teens, it will never bring them back.

Towery credited Whitson’s family for giving samples of their DNA to help solidify the findings of the case.

""What we have been able to do here is bring closure to a family, and this work has allowed that family to have some degree of peace,"" said Klamath County District Attorney, Eve Costello.

Costello praised the work of the detectives and said the county hopes to create a Cold Case Unit in the future.

""I think the investigators from 1978 all the way to 2021 and now 2022 did a wonderful job, I am very proud of them, I know they are all dedicated to their work,” Sheriff Chris Kaber said.","Ray Whitson ID'd as killer of Kirk Wiseman, 19, and Cynthia Frayer, 17, both of whom were shot to death near Klamath Falls, OR, in 1978.

136,erobin37,[],1641779835,"Christopher G. Janus was a Chicago stockbroker and one of the first Americans allowed in the People’s Republic of China in the 1970s. When he returned to America, he revealed that he has been tasked by the government to look for the [Peking Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Man) – a collection of early human fossils discovered in China and lost during WW2 – in the United States. According to the story, the fossils were entrusted to U.S. Marines for safeguarding from the Japanese invaders. Then, the fossils disappeared.

Soon, Janus announces that he was getting closer to the fossils. After he offered rewards for the fossils, he said, a woman contacted him. She claimed to be the widow of a U.S. Marine, and that she had the fossils with her. They arranged a meeting at the top of the Empire State Building. The woman gave Janus a photograph of a box full of bones. Then, Janus recounted, “a man appeared from the shadows and pointed a camera toward them,” and the woman vanished.

With this dramatic story, Janus managed to collect $640,000, raised from investors and loaned from banks, to fund his search for the fossils and to produce a feature film – said to be directed by the renowned Otto Preminger. Janus published a book, The Search for Peking Man. In the book, he described his attempts to locate the fossils were being thwarted by a Dr. Fu Manchu-like figure who was “a person of immense intelligence and cunning \[...\] who could manipulate people and control situations.” On the back cover, he notes that “this is a true story” and the book was “soon to be a major motion picture.”

As you might have suspected, Janus was a fraudster. In the 1980s, he was charged with two counts of fraud. He did not actually use the money for the search nor the filmmaking. The photograph Janus produced has since been described as dubious. While Janus’ search may be fake, the frenzied search for the Peking Man was very much real. What really happened to the Peking Man?

**The discovery**

In the 1920s, an international archaeological team working at a site 50km southwest of Peking (Beijing), China, discovered two human-like teeth. [Davidson Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_Black), a Canadian anatomist at the [Peking Union Medical College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Union_Medical_College) (PUMC), saw it as a breakthrough in human anthropology, creating an entirely genus/species for the discovery – *Sinanthropus pekinensis*. In the following decade, the team would eventually find parts of about 50 individuals, including several complete skullcaps. Even though there were multiple specimens found, they were collectively nicknamed the “Peking Man” fossils. They were kept in two safes near Black’s office in the PUMC. However, when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the fossils vanished from history.

Today, the fossils were viewed less of a “breakthrough” – it has been reclassified as the widespread *Homo erectus*. More importantly though, the fossils played a role in both nationalistic and later Communist propaganda, as they emphasized what the government saw as the “evolutionary continuity” of Chinese ethnicity and culture. Interest in locating the lost fossils was high, and remains so in China.

**What is absolutely known about their fate**

By 1941, China was no stranger to war – the war with Japan had begun in 1937, with Beijing falling to Japan in the summer of the same year. During this time, Japan showed “great interest” in the fossils, with army officers often visiting PUMC and requesting to see the fossils. In fact, on two occasions, PUMC officials felt so threatened by the Japanese that the fossils were sent to American banks (which was then neutral) for safekeeping.

As 1941 drew near, so did rumors of war between US and Japan. Fearing such a war, and concerned about the Japanese interest, PUMC officials began considering more options to safeguard the fossils. At first, the Chinese authorities insisted that the fossils were not to be removed from China, though they eventually agreed that the best option is to move them to the United States. As such, they were last seen boxed at the PUMC at the end of November 1941. As one book on the subject puts it, “there is still not a single reliable account of a sighting of the fossils since they were packed \[…\] in 1941.” What follows is a plethora of conflicting and wildly inconsistent narratives, which can partly be attributed to intentional misdirection from the personal to national level, to avoid Japanese discovery of the fossils.

**Here's where it gets confusing**

Presented here is the most popular narrative of the fate. It may seem compelling here, but in the background are dozens of conflicting narratives – all equally lacking in evidence. 

There are no less than 5 differing accounts on who packed the fossils into what. Again, intentional misdirection is at play here. For example, one Chinese excavator claimed that they were packed by Americans – so the Chinese could maintain deniability when questioned by the Japanese. This is deemed unlikely as the packers were administrators at the PUMC who had no experience with handling archaeological materials. The most credible account is that two Chinese technicians packed the fossils in two large unpainted wooden boxes, each roughly the size of an office desk. Perhaps Americans were then allowed to re-pack the fossils. According to the Chinese technicians, then, the fossils were then delivered to the administrative wing at the PUMC, and they had no further knowledge of its fate.

In a subsequent investigation of their whereabouts (1947), Col. [William W. Ashurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_W._Ashurst), a Marine Corps commander, recounts “During November 1941, several boxes were accepted by me from the officials of the \[PUMC\], for shipment to the United States. These boxes were shipped together with other property belonging to the Marine Detachment \[…\] to [Chinwangtao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinhuangdao), China… These materials remained in the cars at Chinwangtao awaiting shipment in the [SS President Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Kachidoki_Maru) to Manila. (Philippines) and were so located when the war started on December 8, 1941.”

Note that Ashurst never mentioned “fossils” in his recollection. In fact, in a 1952 interview, Ashurst said that he did not verify that the fossils were in the boxes. In the same interview, Ashurst said that the fossils were shipped as part of his personal baggage, contradicting his earlier claims that they were shipped with the Marine Detachment properties. Another point of suspect is that in the interview, the fossils were described as “a few handfuls of yellowed and fossilized bones,” painting a starkly different picture than two office desk-sized boxes. But then, again, Ashurst did not actually see the fossils, so where did that information come from?

In any case, SS *President Harrison* never arrived at Chingwangtao. She was caught by Japanese destroyers upon the outbreak of the Pacific War and ran aground near Shanghai. And thus, Ashurst’s cargo was left at the Chingwangtao rail station. Ashurst speculated that the Japanese captured the fossils at Chingwangtao and discarded them without knowing their significance. Ashurst reiterated that he did not know if the fossils were actually part of the cargo.

PUMC’s own investigation in 1945 appeared to agree with this hypothesis. “Presumably, on December 8, 1941, it was among the Marine equipment assembled on the dock at Chingwantao awaiting transportation, all of which was seized by the Japanese military.” Note the use of “presumably” here as there is no direct evidence found to support this hypothesis. Secondly, the use of “it” to refer to the fossils – as mentioned above it is likely that they were packed in two boxes. In the PUMC’s discussions though, they were consistently referred to singularly as “the case.” 

**Here's what Japan knows… OR IS IT?**

The Japanese appeared to be unaware of the fossil’s whereabouts – though the possibilities that they had discarded it without knowing its significance, or somehow decided to hide the fossils from the rest of the world, cannot be discounted, no matter how slim. As noted before, Japan was clearly interested in the fossils. Thus in 1942, they began questioning PUMC officials about their whereabouts. They eventually obtained some leads and conducted searches at Chinwangtao, but no discovery was announced. After the war, a Japanese anthropologist who once visited the PUMC, Kotondo Hasebe, was questioned by the U.S. Occupation officials. He insisted that Japan did not know the whereabouts of the fossils.

**Recent discoveries**

After the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, excavations continued, and more fossils were eventually discovered. Since then, there were only rumors – that the fossils were now in the private collection of the Japanese Emperor, that the Nationalists had taken the fossils with them to Taiwan, that it was reburied somewhere in rural China, that it sunk with the Awa Maru…

In 2000, Chinese sources published a “recently discovered” 1945 interview where two US Marine, Sgt. Snider and Sgt. Jackson, claimed to have picked up two boxes from PUMC in December 1941. The Marines believed that the boxes contained the fossils – though they did not check their contents. However, no records of Sgt. Snider or Jackson could be found amongst the roster of soldiers in North China in December 1941.

In 2006, the local government near the fossil site established a search committee to track down the missing bones. The committee contacted Japan, who once again told authorities that they didn’t have the fossils. The lead paleoanthropologist also asked if he could form a search committee in Japan. He was turned down, and later told the media in an accusatory tone – “If you didn’t take it, what are you afraid of?” Perhaps he was adhering to the party line in blaming foreign countries for the loss of the fossils.

In 2012, Paul Bowen, the son of former U.S. Marine Richard Bowen, emailed paleoanthropologist [Lee Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Rogers_Berger) of South Africa. The son recounts his father’s tale that his unit, stationed in [Camp Holcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Holcomb), Chingwangtao in 1947 during the Chinese Civil War, was digging foxholes when they “found a box that was full of bones. \[…\] It gave us a little scare and we filled in that hole and dug another.” Berger went to China at the location described and found that it is now a warehouse and a parking lot. There was no further excavation. This discovery builds on top of the standard narrative, which was constructed through conflicting hearsays and no physical evidence.

**tl;dr**

To summarize, the fossils were last seen in the Peking Union Medical College, being packed for transport in November 1941. There is no agreement on what kind of container(s) they were packed in, and no evidence at all as to its fate after its departure from the college. Their fate was obfuscated by both intentional war-time misdirection and the fog of war. Perhaps it was safeguarded all too well. As the generation of WW2 veterans die out, it is unlikely we will find a satisfactory conclusion to the story, save for the discovery or declassification of some important documents. 

Fun Fact: In 1977, [a Hong Kong remake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Peking_Man) of *King Kong* (1976) featuring the Peking Man was released. The movie had a Japanese special effects team, who later became famous for their work in Godzilla movies.

137,CherryBlossom724,[],1641778051,"* **Background**

Steven Clark was born in Colchester, Essex, in 1969, to parents Charles and Doris. One day when Steven was two years old, Doris left the house to go shopping. Unbeknownst to her, Steven had somehow gotten out of the house and had started to follow her. She soon heard a commotion and found that Steven had wandered into the road and had been hit by a lorry. He spent a month in a coma and was left with a pronounced limp and permanent damage to his left arm.

He was said to be a happy person, though the limitations of his disability sometimes got him down. He worked hard and excelled in his courses, even earning an ""Apprentice of the Year"" award. He attended the Rathbone Society in Redcar, which is an organization that helps disabled people find employment. Steven very much wanted to find work, but sadly he found that employers were hesitant to hire him, due to his disability.

* **The day of Steven's disappearance**

On December 28th, 1992, Charles Clark had a ticket to go watch the Middlesbrough football match. Steven had wanted to attend the game with him, but Charles told him that he could only go if he paid for his ticket himself. Steven decided not to go. According to his parents, it was a running joke in their family that Steven didn't like to spend his own money on anything. However, it seems to me that he likely wouldn't have had much money due to not being able to find employment? In which case that was a pretty cruel joke. 

According to Doris, with Charles away at the football match, Steven decided that he wanted to go for a long walk. So they took a walk along the beach and ended up in Saltburn, around 45 minutes away from their home. At this point, Steven said he needed to use the bathroom and so they stopped at a public restroom. Steven went into the men's restroom and Doris waited outside for a minute before deciding to go into the women's restroom. When she came out, there was no sign of Steven, so she assumed that he was still in the restroom. She spotted two men and a little girl there. The two men took turns waiting outside the men's restroom with the little girl while one of them went inside. Doris didn't think to ask either man if they had seen her son in there. And she didn't want to go in there to check on him herself, because in her own words, ""He would have been horrified. He was 23, not a child."" After waiting a while longer (I couldn't find out how long exactly), she assumed that Steven had simply left without her and headed home, so she followed suit. But when she finally got home, Steven was not there. When Charles arrived home, she told him that Steven was missing and they went out to look for him together. After 24 hours had passed, they called the police. However, the police couldn't find any signs of Steven or what had happened to him either.

* **Additional info**

* There were a number of unconfirmed sightings of Steven following his disappearance, but it's unclear if any of them are credible.

* According to Charles, Steven had met a girl at The Ship Inn in Saltburn and had started dating her days before his disappearance. I couldn't find any information about her though.

* A witness came forward recently to say that she had spotted Steven near his house at around 3pm on the day he went missing, which was about the same time he supposedly vanished from a public restroom 45 minutes away. 

* In 1999, the police received an anonymous letter claiming that Steven's parents had murdered him. While the author has since come forward, her identity and the full contents of the letter have not been released. However, she admitted that she didn't actually know the family and that her accusation was merely based on a ""feeling"".

* Steven's case was officially classified as a murder in 2020 and his parents were considered the prime suspects. They were arrested, but later released. A thorough search was conducted of their house and yard, but no evidence was found.

* **Theories**

* His parents are responsible for his disappearance. We only have Doris's word for them even being at the public restroom that day, as no witness has ever come forward to corroborate her story. Also, it appears that this case was poorly investigated initially and the fact that the search of their home in 2020 turned up nothing doesn't prove their innocence, since they've had decades to get rid of anything incriminating. It's unclear what their motive would have been, but maybe whatever happened to Steven was an accident that they covered up. 

* It was a crime of opportunity and Steven was kidnapped from the public bathroom. *Or* Doris's assumption that Steven had left without her was correct and someone kidnapped him on his way home.

138,mysterypapaya,[],1641776248,"I'm late to the party and just watched the Netflix Documentary ""Evil Genius"", about the infamous ""Pizza Bombing Incident"" On August 28, 2003 in Erie, Pennsylvania. This article has some good insight on the robbery: [https://www.wired.com/2010/12/ff-collarbomb/](https://www.wired.com/2010/12/ff-collarbomb/) .However, four elements about the case just still don't add up for me:

**1) The robbery is 100% Evil, yes. But...Genius???? What did the perpetrators realistically have to gain, moneywise?** It struck me as extremely bizarre that they went through such detail in their letter (demanding $250,000 to the bank in 15 minutes, etc.) but that the time they allotted the bank teller (15 minutes), would in no way allow a long enough window for the teller to actually access the vaults. I know we are dealing with a group of people with questionnable mental conditions, but it seems obvious to me that the teller was only able to hand in a much smaller amount: (In this case, under $8000.) This money is not worth all the time gon into the plan.... Considering the eventual outcome that Wells would have even successfully avoided police....and gone to the first stop...there are still so many chances his car would have exploded at the drop off spot, bringing attention to the thieves. There are also so many chances the $8000 would have been on him while he exploded. There are chances he may leave the paper instructions at the bank...etc. How is this plan by any logical means a smart way to successfully obtain $250 000? Is there a chance, (other than 1/100) that it would have worked? It seems to me the plan was surprisingly well-worked out in some aspects (the bomb/obtaining access to Wells for long enough to install the device) but was unrealistically stupid in that it seemed to surely result in his murder, the murder being loud and public, and in a smaller amount of money. What do you think was the planned ending of this heist? How did they plan to actually deal with the bomb once they would have collected the money?

**2) Why did Bill Rothstein rad himself off to the cops?**  
In his case, he surprisingly succeeded in deflecting attention from himself onto Marjorie Diehl. I guess he must have been very afraid of her. Do you think there were back and forth threats between these two, and the others involved, of calling the police, and he just outsmarted his group of co-criminals by being the first to pick up the phone? However, it seems like a risky move...

3) **Moral and legal right to decapitate the victim?** I'm from Canada, and I don't even know if we have a law regarding this, but it would seem to me incredibly untactful of police forces to not contact the family before decapitating a murdered body. Is there no regulation forbidding them to carry on without approval of relatives? Couldn't they break the collar with specific tools and then glue it back together and still understand how it worked, thus preserving the victim's neck?

4) **Why was Wells so calm in his last 20 minutes when he was finally with the police?** I imagine most people in his situation would be crying, hysterical, or pleading for help with urgency. Sometimes you need dramatic type of behaviour to make authorities, who tend to stall, to get a move on and help you. The only reason that comes up for me is: He must have believed his ""friends/collaborators"" would not actually blow him up.

When I sat down to do this write-up, I knew it wasn’t going to be an easy job but it turned into so much more than I imagined. I simply cannot report on the depth of Mr. Gillern’s disappearance, and I apologize for that. I am not the best writer in the community, so please excuse my lack of ability when reading this synopsis.  The links at the bottom of the page, especially the website created by Aeryn’s mother, are best suited for telling Mr. Gillern’s story.

*Background*: 

Aeryn Michael John Gillern was born in Elmira, New York, on April 28, 1973. He disappeared in Stephansplatz, Vienna, Austria on October 29, 2007. He was employed as a research assistant by The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) which is headquartered in Vienna and began working there in 2003. Aeryn was named Mr. Gay Austria in 2006.

*Disappearance*: 

Austrian police notified Mrs. Gillern, a retired police officer, on October 31, 2007, that her son was last seen running naked from the Kaiserbründl bathhouse in Weihburggasse. It was assumed that he was involved in a fight there, but his last confirmed location was at a sauna on Stephansplatz. Police also speculated that he committed suicide by jumping in the Danube. Aeryn’s friends don’t agree with this supposition, and his mother thinks the investigation was hampered by his sexuality. The Austrian police changed their account several times and denied the presence of any witnesses even though they received a phone from people soon after he was reported missing. The Austrian police stated it was not their responsibility to investigate the disappearance because Aeryn was not a citizen and would not interview Mrs. Gillern or any of his friends. 

*Attempts at Resolution*:

Mrs. Gillern has not and will not give up the quest to learn what happened to her son. Beginning in 2008 she held a vigil every year outside of the Kaiserbründl on October 29 but has not been in Vienna the last three years due to costly airfare and Austria’s COVID lockdown. She was last informed in, second-handily, that the case is no longer an active investigation. Her website [http://www.aeryngillern.com](http://www.aeryngillern.com/) is extremely detailed and quite worth the read for, as I said, I cannot begin to describe all the ins and outs of this case. 

The 2011 documentary Gone: The Disappearance of Aeryn Gillern is dedicated to his mother's search for the truth behind her son's disappearance.

Laced-up hiking boots with round knobs on the sole..

I was wondering if he may have had gangrene of the penis leading to the removal, or if he was part of a cartel like organisation that would've done this to him either as an initiation or as punishment..

Considering he was burned, i would imagine.he hails from the US and he was burned to hide his identity, which has worked for 46 years. As he is still unidentified.

Nothing, apparently…because they disappeared, never to be seen from again.

It’s actually quite tragic, and baffling. (And not as uncommon as you would think. There are other instances of unexplained disappearances; links at the end.)

Be warned: this mystery has no answers, just questions.

# The 5 Men and the Disappearance 

The five friends were Jack (Jackie) Huett, 24; Gary Mathias, 25; William (Bill) Sterling, 29; Jack Madruga, 30; and Ted Weiher, 32.

On the night of February 24, 1978, the five left their homes in Yuba, CA in Madruga’s white and turquoise 1969 Mercury Montego. Their destination was a basketball game in Chico, CA between UC Davis and California State University, Chico. 

They were avid basketball fans, often gathering together to watch or play basketball. In fact, they had their own game to play on the next day, February 25. It was part of a local program for the mentally handicapped and was sponsored by the Special Olympics.

You see, Mathias was diagnosed with schizophrenia while in the Army and based in Germany, and was subsequently psychiatrically discharged. Huett and Sterling had slight intellectual disabilities, and Weiher and Madruga - who was also an Army vet - were unofficially considered “slow learners.”

Anyway, they left the game and stopped at Behr’s Market in downtown Chico to buy one Hostess cherry pie, one Langendorf lemon pie, one Snickers bar, one Marathon bar, two Pepsis and 1.5 quart of milk. The clerk remembered them because she was annoyed that the men arrived right before closing at 10pm.

That was the last time they were seen alive. The morning of February 25 came and went, and when none of their guardians - who they lived with - heard from them, they notified the police.

# The Investigation

The first to be discovered was the car, on February 28, parked along Oroville-Quincy Road in the Plumas National Forest…not anywhere near or on the way to Yuba. Question #1 (and #2): how did they end up there, and why?

Maybe they were stuck in snow? But no, the snow was not so deep that five strapping, young men couldn’t push the car out. Maybe the engine stalled? The keys were missing, but when police hot-wired the car, the engine started immediately. Maybe they ran out of gas? Nope, it was one quarter full. 

The questions piled on when they examined the car further at the station and noticed no dents, gouges or even mud scrapes on its undercarriage, which should have been present given the Mercury Montego’s low-hanging mufflers, the bumpy mountain road (which is now paved, apparently), and the five grown men riding in it. 

They concluded that either the driver was extremely careful or the driver was familiar with the roads (none of the men were familiar with that area). The car was also unlocked and a window rolled down when police found it, which is uncharacteristic of Madruga.

Actually, the car was the only thing found for a while. The police were sent on wild goose chases with several reported sightings - one putting them in Arizona and Nevada - but only two were deemed credible.

First, Joseph Schons, who had indeed gotten stuck in the snow on the night of February 24 about 150 feet up the road from where the Mercury Montego was found, was experiencing a mild heart attack while attempting to free his car. He went back in the car, kept the engine running to provide heat and lied there, waiting for the pain to pass. Around midnight, he saw headlights coming up behind him and he saw the car park, headlights on and a group of people around it, one of which looked to him like a woman holding a baby. 

Question #3: who the heck was holding a baby?! He called for help and received an icy response: they stopped talking and turned their headlights off. Later, he saw lights from flashlights and received the same cold response when he called out for help. In the early morning, when his car ran out of gas and his pain subsided, he walked 8 miles (this author wishes she could walk 8 miles, let alone do it in the early morning after managing a minor heart attack and sleeping in a car) down the road to a lodge that he had passed the day before. When the manager drove him home, they passed the abandoned Mercury Montego at the point where Schons had recalled hearing the voices hours before.

Second, a store clerk about 30 miles from where the car was found told deputies that four men matching the description from the fliers the families had posted had stopped by the store in a red pickup truck two days after the disappearance. The store owner corroborated her account. But nothing came from it. Question #4-6: Were those the same men? If so, who was missing? And how did they get the red pickup truck?

# Bodies Discovered 

Maybe something foul was afoot?! But alas, no…unless you meant the smell.

Months later, on June 4, after the snow had melted, a group of motorcyclists went to a trailer camp maintained as shelter by the Forest Service off the road about 19 miles from where the Mercury Montego was found. 

The trailer’s window had been broken and when they opened the door, the odor of decay overwhelmed them. The body was later identified as Weiher’s.

The next day, searchers found remains belonging to Madruga and Sterling on opposite sides of the road about 11 miles from where the car had been. Autopsy showed they both died of hypothermia, but Madruga’s body had been partially consumed by scavenging animals, while Sterling’s bones were scattered over a small area.

Two days later, Huett’s own father found his son’s backbone two miles northeast of the trailer. His shoes and jeans were found nearby and his skull was about 300 ft away, confirming his identity through dental records. Huett too succumbed to hypothermia.

That’s four out of the five men. The fifth man - Mathias - was never found, dead or alive.

# Theories

So, what do you think? Was there foul play or did a drive take a wrong turn?

Investigators still have no idea what exactly happened to the five men: why they ended up near the Forest, why they left the car on foot, and what happened after they left the car and how long they had been dead.

The prevailing theory is that they left the car and followed a trail made by a Forest Service snowmobile the previous day in the direction of the trailer camp, hoping to find shelter nearby (reminder: the trailer was 19 miles from where the car was found). Madruga and Sterling succumbed to hypothermia about half way there, while the other three made it to the trailer, only to find it locked, so they broke a window to enter. 

Here comes the sad part: they probably thought they would be found soon and since they were literally breaking and entering, they may have feared arrest for theft if they used any of the stuff there – and there were enough foodstuff in the trailer and in a storage shed outside to sustain five grown men for a year, a butane (gas) tank, and a fireplace with matches and paperback novels to use as kindling to keep warm – all of which remained unused. But they probably stayed in that trailer for 3 months, based on Weiher’s beard length and his drastic weight loss (he was 200 lbs when he left Yuba the night of Feb 24 and he was a little over 100 lbs when they found his body on June 4). 

The theory posits that after Weiher died (and they assumed he died first because they found him with eight layers of sheets on top of him, including his head), Huett and Mathias attempted to return to civilization by foot and met their fate. Maybe Mathias made it, maybe not. All we know for sure is that his shoes were found in the trailer and he probably took Weiher’s shoes, since those could not be found.

An anticlimactic ending to a question-filled mystery. (I think they call that Occam’s razor.)

However, there is also a second mystery involving the other figures released by Hasbro in 1984 as part of the inexpensive Mini Vehicles series. 

Besides [Bumblebee](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/1/14/Bumblebeeg1toy.jpg), the Volkswagen Beetle, [Cliffjumper](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/3/33/G1_Cliffjumper_toy.jpg), the Porsche 924, and [""Bumper""](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/f/f8/G1-toy_Bumper.jpg), the Mazda Familia, there were four other characters in the Mini Vehicle assortment: [Brawn](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/2/23/G1-toy_Brawn.jpg), who transformed into a Suzuki Jimny SJ20, [Gears](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/b/b2/G1Gears_toy.jpg), who transformed into a pickup truck of indeterminate make, [Huffer](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/1/1d/G1Huffer_toy.jpg), who transformed into a semi truck loosely resembling a Volvo F88, and [Windcharger](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/4/4d/G1Windcharger_toy.jpg), who transformed into a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Like Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper, these four characters were previously sold by Japanese company Takara in 1983 as part of the [Micro Change Mini CAR Robo series.](https://www.micromanforever.com/MC04MiniCAR.htm)

Notably, Brawn, Huffer, Gears, and Windcharager have a design style separating them from Bumblebee, Cliffjumper and Bumper, who had rubber tires and resembled Penny Racers/Choro-Q toy cars, another product produced by Takara and released in the United States in 1981. Instead, these four had plastic tires and a slightly more realistic aesthetic in vehicle mode. Additionally, unlike the detailed faces seen on Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper; Brawn, Huffer, Gears, and Windcharger have extremely simplistic face designs that didn’t resemble those found on most other Transformers. Finally, Brawn, Gears, and Huffer have [“M” logos](https://static.seibertron.com/images/toys/files/01/r_gears001.jpg) on them. At first, fans believed that the logos stood for [Micro Change](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Micro_Change), and that explanation wouldn’t be questioned until 2018.

In 2018, Blake Wright started a Kickstarter campaign for a book called *Toys That Time Forgot*,  which showcased a variety of unreleased action figure concepts. Notably, the book discussed a line of figures called Mysterians, which was completely unrelated to [the 1957 movie with a very similar title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterians). The line was produced by Knickerbocker Toys, best known for producing Raggedy Ann Dolls starting in the 1960s, and was being developed in 1982 for release in 1983. However, Hasbro bought Knickerbocker in 1982 and all plans for the Mysterians, including a planned Marvel comic book series, were shelved. Hasbro would later approach Marvel to write a Transformers comic book series, with editor-in-chief [Jim Shooter](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Jim_Shooter) working on both.

Strangely, Mysterians was to consist of two completely different sub-lines. The first was [The Hidden Force](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/a/a6/Mysterians_guardians_and_warbots.jpg), a series of robots that transformed into various shapes. Notably, the line had a similar aesthetic to the [*Golden Warrior Gold Lightan*](http://www.theoldrobots.com/Ultimate4.html) series of robots that turned into cigarette lighters, with the “Tinkar” character from Mysterians being quite similar to the [“Mechanic Lightan” character from Gold Lightan.](http://www.theoldrobots.com/images68/MechanicLightan-1.JPG)

The other sub-line, [The Mobile Force](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/File:Mysterians_mobile_force.jpg) is where things start to get strange. The characters Truckar, Jeepar, and Blazar resemble the Transformers characters Huffer, Brawn, and Gears. Additionally, a fourth character, [Speedar,](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/b/bf/Mysterians_speedar.jpg) who only exists as concept art, resembles the Transformers character Windcharger. The art for these figures features even less humanlike faces that what can be seen on the Transformers figures. Although Truckar looks mostly similar to Huffer, Jeepar has a hollow semicircle instead of Brawn’s visor, and Blazar has a completely solid faceplate instead of one with a visor like Gears. The Micro Change figures feature the same faces as the Transformers release, implying that this change was not done by Hasbro, who added a [crude face sticker](https://tilallaremine.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/g1-ironhide-g1-robot.jpg) to the seat of the [Cherry Vanette figure](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aNF9-377lH4/VTv-EqUWsbI/AAAAAAAAH-E/E4FQC7z67JM/s1600/FinnOnebox01.jpg) figure to make the character Ironhide. 


Due to the release date of 1983, it seems unlikely that Knickerbocker purchased these designs from Takara, who wouldn’t release them until 1983. Additionally, the artwork for Speedar was drawn by an artist working for Knickerbocker, and not Takara. Unlike Hasbro, which used toys from various lines to create The Transformers, Takara never released any other company’s properties as part of their own line until 1985, where they began to sell Transformers.
Eventually, later in 1983, Hasbro representatives at the Tokyo Toy Show discovered the Micro Change figures and used them as part of their new Transformers line in 1984, including the four designs that were connected to Knickerbocker.

Furthermore, there are no patents for any of the original Mini Vehicle figures, even though [patents](https://www.transformerland.com/blog/g1-transformers-patent-table/) exist for most of the other original Transformers figures, making their design status unknown. However, since Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper resemble another Takara product, it can be assumed that they were designed by Takara. Although the website lists patents for Brawn, Gears, and Windcharger, they actually belong to later figures called [Outback](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/9/96/G1toy_outback.jpg), [Swerve](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/File:G1-toy_Swerve.jpg), and [Tailgate](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/8/82/G1_Tailgate_toy.jpg), which were heavily modified versions of Brawn, Gears, and Windcharger. A modified version of Huffer called [Pipes](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/0/00/G1_minibot_pipes.jpg) was also released. Notably, these figures have heads more similar to those of other Transformers, with Outback even getting hands, something that Brawn didn’t have.

In 1984, the six Hidden Force robots would be released by a company called Marchon, which would later be known for releasing a remote-controlled figure of the [Megazord](https://www.dallasvintagetoys.com/images/products/detail/IMG_1411.6.jpg) from *Mighty Morphin Power Rangers*. The characters all got new names, and the Hidden Force was rebranded as the Secret Force, but the toys were still sold as [Mysterians](http://www.theoldrobots.com/Mysterians.html). No link between Hasbro and Marchon has been discovered and it is unknown how Marchon got these molds.

Several questions about the relationship between Hasbro, Takara, Marchon, and Knickerbocker still remain unsolved:

Did Takara help Knickerbocker make the Mysterians? 

If that was the case, why didn’t they look more like Micro Change figures?

Where did Brawn, Huffer, Gears, and Windcharger get their faces from? 

If Knickerbocker made the faces, why does the packaging art not have them?

If Takara made the faces, why are they so simplistic compared to Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper’s faces or the faces of their modified counterparts?

Did Hasbro sell Knickerbocker’s Mysterians molds to Takara? 

If so, why did Hasbro not discover Micro Change until the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show? 

Additionally, why did Takara add these figures to their Micro Change line instead of making their own?

Why didn’t Takara patent any of the original Mini Vehicles?

Was it because they didn't design the figures?

Why didn't they patent Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper, then?

Why didn’t Takara or Hasbro use the Hidden Force molds? 

Were they seen as far too primitive compared to the Mobile Force? 

How did Marchon get the molds for the Mysterians Hidden Force? 

Did Hasbro sell the molds to them figuring that they were too primitive to be Transformers? 

If Marchon got the molds in 1982, why did they only release the molds in 1984, after Transformers became popular?

If Hasbro sold the molds to Marchon after the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show, why would they enable a potential competitor?


TL;DR

Four characters sold by Hasbro as part of the Transformers Mini Vehicles line seem to have been created by a company called Knickerbocker Toys as part of a line called Mysterians.

Knickerbocker never released the figures, with them being added to Japanese toy company Takara’s Micro Change line, which would later inspire Transformers.

A company called Marchon would later release other Mysterians figures that were not used by Takara after Hasbro released the Transformers, changing the character names, but still using *Mysterians* branding.

It is unknown who made the Mysterians molds, why they were released by Takara, or how Marchon was able to sell the remaining Mysterians.

143,saysigil,[],1641686128,"I’ve been waiting for Skip Hollandsworth of Texas Monthlyto release a new episode discussing some of the happenings since the podcast ended, was excited to see a new episode drop yesterday! I still believe that Tom committed suicide, I don’t know how much his family knows but it was interesting to finally hear someone from the state involved in the investigation. 

[Episode link](https://www.texasmonthly.com/podcast/tom-browns-body-chapter-9/)

For those unfamiliar with this case a quick recap: Tom was a teenager from Canadian, Texas who went missing in November of 2016. His remains were found a few years later with no cause of death able to be determined. Canadian is a small town where everyone knows everyone and there are a large amount of rumors regarding what happened, including that he committed suicide and his family moved his body to avoid the shame, the ex-sheriff of the town murdered Tom, he was shot on accident by another teen, etc. 

There’s a lot of interesting aspects of this case even if his cause of death is not a true mystery (in my opinion). There are a lot of unanswered questions and interesting characters involved. I highly recommend reading Skip’s articles in Texas Monthly or listening to the podcast.

144,appeltreeingarden,[],1641679308,"On October 31st, 1955, Marilyn Damman took her 7 month old daughter Pamela and her 2 year old son Steven to the Food Fair market to buy a loaf of bread. The market is close to where the family lived in East Meadow, about 1 and a half blocks away from their house. They arrived at the store at around 2.30 P.M. Marilyn left the children outside of the store. When she returned outside around 2.40 P.M, both children were gone. Marilyn at first thought Steven might have pushed his sisters pram back to their house, so she returned home. It would turn out that that was not what had happened. 

Pamela would be found by a family friend approximately 300 feet from the Food Fair Market. She was still in the pram, and she was unharmed. 

A large search was conducted for Steven who was still missing. Around 5000 people, both law enforcement officers and civilians, searched for the missing child but uncovered no trace of him. At 6.30 P.M November 1st, the search for Steven was called off, and determined that Steven had been kidnapped. 

At first, the police wondered if this could be a crime motivated by ""maternal desire."" Meaning, a person who might have miscarried or whose child might have died were so distraught and wanting of a child that that would prompt them to steal a child. Link to article explaining this further: [Heidi Broussard case.](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/FBI-says-Magen-Fieramusca-charged-with-14970795.php) They looked into this and looked for children who died in the area shortly before Steven was kidnapped. The police also compiled a list of six ""deviants"" in the area of East Meadow who they reasoned could possibly be behind the disappearance. 

The Damman family would receive a series of ransom notes demanding large sums of money in exchange of the child. This was in November of 1955. It would turn out that the letters were written by a opportunistic college student who actually had nothing to do with the disappearance. 

Also at the end of November 1955, Steven's parents made a public plea to the kidnappers to make sure Steven got to take his vitamins and his iron supplements. Steven was anemic. 

It's been speculated that Steven was the boy in the box, a John Doe child found dead in 1957. This was ruled out after a DNA test. A man came forward in 2009, claiming to be Steven. This was also ruled out because of a DNA test.

145,Prudent_Rub_6971,[],1641670698,"Let me just start off by saying I very rarely post anything on any kind of social media, so sorry if this post seems kind of ""amature"" but I am what people call a true crime junkie. I wanted to ask anyone here of their thoughts and opinions on what is called ""The Dylatov Pass Incident."" It's about the unexplained or undefined deaths of 9 hikers in Russia in the late 1950's. Here's a description of the case:

On January 23rd 1959 10 very experienced hikers (8 male 2 female) boarded a train to head to the Ural mountains which is in the middle of the Soviet Union. Throughout their trip the group made pretty consistent journal entries and took lots and lots of pictures on their camera. On January 28th one of the hikers (male) felt ill and decided to head back home while the rest of the group continued the hike. A search party is later launched as no one has heard from the group. On February 26th the group of searchers found the hikers campsite. The tents in the campsite were completely destroyed and had been slashed open with a knife from the inside, all their belongings were in disarray. 9 sets of footprints were found walking away from the tent. Based on the way the appearance of the footprints it's as if the group made their way calmly and they were most certainly walking. The footprints led them to the edge of the forest and next to an improvised campfire where two bodies that were two of the hikers were found. The two bodies were way underdressed for the type of the weather they were in. The tree next to them had signs that it had been climbed. Three of the other hikers bodies were found in the distance from the tent to where the other two were found they were better dressed than the other two but still were underdressed. All 5 of them died of hypothermia, some of them had minor injuries and 4 of them died while intoxicated. The last 4 hikers were found at the bottom of a small cliff. 3 of them had lethal injuries and they were compared to that of a fall. Two of them had gaping eye sockets and one of the women had a missing tongue. Six of the hikers died from hypothermia while the other 3 died from physical trauma. On May 28th the case was closed with the explanation that ""The cause of death was an unknown compelling force that the hikers were unable to overcome."" The case remained closed until the Soviet Union decided to re-open the case in 2019 and presented their findings in July of 2020. They claimed that the hikers had died due to fear of an avalanche, then the case was closed.

I would argue that there are many holes in the theory of fear of an avalanche. There are also many other injuries the hikers sustained as well as photos and journal entries that I did not detail in this post that are worth looking at. I wonder what actually happened to them. I'm tied between foul play and something natural, though I feel like their wasn't a third party involved. Was one of them a threat to the rest? It would explain the tent being cut from the inside.

146,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,[],1641663600," **Details:** Thirty-nine-year-old Chuck Morgan was a successful businessman who was the president of his own escrow agency. He was also a potential witness in a state land fraud case involving a known crime boss. On March 22, 1977, he left his Tucson, Arizona home to drive two of his daughters to school. After dropping them off, he vanished. Three days later, he arrived back at his home. According to his wife, Ruth, he was missing a shoe, had a plastic handcuff around one ankle, and had his hands tied together with a plastic zip tie. He could not speak, but with a pen and paper, he wrote down that he had been kidnapped and tortured. He also wrote that a hallucinogenic drug had been painted on his throat. He claimed that this drug would drive him insane or kill him if he ingested it. He asked Ruth to move his car, because he did not want ""them"" to know that he had returned home. However, he would not say who ""they"" were. He also told her not to call the police because a hit would be put out on the lives of them and their family members.  
For one week, Ruth nursed Chuck back to health by feeding him with an eye dropper. Before his voice returned, he began to allude to a secret identity. He claimed that he had worked as an agent for the federal government and he fought against organized crime. He also claimed that ""they"" had taken his treasury identification. He said that he escaped from his captors near Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport.  
After his kidnapping, Chuck became justifiably paranoid. He began wearing a bulletproof vest. He also started driving his daughters to and from school. He informed the school that nobody else should be allowed to pick them up. On June 7, two months after his initial disappearance, Chuck vanished again. Shortly before his second disappearance, he told his father that if anything were to happen to him, there was a letter he had written that would tell them who was responsible. The letter was never found; however, nine days later, an unidentified woman called Ruth and said: ""Chuck is alright, Ecclesiastics 12: 1-8"". This is a reference to a Bible passage, which reads, in part:  
*""Men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road. Remember him before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed. Then the dust will return to the earth as it was and the spirit will return to God who gave it.""*  
Two days later, Chuck was found shot to death despite the fact he was found wearing a bulletproof vest. His body was found in the desert thirty feet off the highway in the San Juan Springs area. He had been shot once in the back of the head with a bullet from his .357 Magnum, which was lying beside him. No fingerprints were found on it. Gunshot residue was found on his left hand, indicating he had fired a weapon. In his car, police found a note that had directions to the crime scene written in his handwriting. Also found in the car were several weapons, ammunition, and a CB radio. Strangely, a piece of one of his teeth was found wrapped in a white handkerchief in the back seat. A pair of sunglasses was also found that did not belong to him.  
Strangely, Chuck had clipped a $2 bill inside his underwear. Written on the bill were seven Spanish names from the letters A to G. Also, Ecclesiastics 12 was written, with the verses 1 through 8 marked by arrows drawn on the bill's serial number. This was the same reference that the female caller had made to Ruth. On the back of the bill, the signers of the Declaration of Independence were numbered 1 through 7. Also, a crude map was drawn, which show several roads between Tucson and the Mexican border. The towns Robles Junction and Sasabe were marked; these towns are apparently known for smuggling.  
Two days after Chuck's death, an anonymous woman spoke to an officer for the Pima County Sheriff's Department on the telephone. She claimed that he was supposed to meet her at a local motel shortly before he died. She claimed that her nickname was ""Green Eyes"" and that she was the same woman that had called Ruth several days earlier. She also claimed that at the motel, Chuck showed her a briefcase containing several thousand dollars in cash. He said that the money would buy him out of a gang contract that had been put on his life.  
Surprisingly, despite the bizarre evidence, authorities ruled that Chuck committed suicide. They believed that he did so either because of financial difficulties or fears for his safety. His family and a reporter named Don Deveraux believe he was murdered. Some investigators also suspect that his death was not a suicide.  
Shortly after Chuck's death, his impounded car was broken into while it was in police possession. Around that same time, his office was also ransacked. Three weeks after his death, two men claiming to be FBI agents arrived at the Morgan home. They told Ruth that they had to look through the house. They tore the house apart and searched for quite awhile. It is unknown if they ever found anything or if they were even FBI agents. When Deveraux contacted the FBI, they claimed that they had never even heard of Chuck Morgan.  
There are several rumors surrounding this case, including that Chuck was killed because he was involved with illegal activity or was doing secret work for the government. His death seems just as unexplained as the events leading to it.  
**Suspects:** Although Chuck claimed that he was working against organized crime, some believe that he was actually involved with it. During the 1970s, Tucson, along with other cities in Arizona, became a place that the mafia moved to, due to its warm climate and controversial criminal justice system. Led by former New York Don [Joseph Bonanno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bonanno), more than five-hundred racketeers moved to Tucson during the 1970s. Their influence led to several gangland-style killings in the area, one of the more famous being the murder of investigative reporter [Don Bolles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bolles).  
What made Arizona most attractive to crime syndicates was a unique state law that allowed them to buy land through numbered blind trust accounts. This would allow them to remain anonymous and successfully launder money. Chuck did real estate escrow work for at least one Mafia family. They may have used him to do escrow work for purchases of gold bullion and platinum; this was a more convenient way for them to launder money. Starting in 1973, it appeared that he was doing several million dollars of escrow work in bullion and platinum. In reality, there was no bullion or platinum. Instead, the money was moved through several escrow accounts and ""legitimized.""  
On one occasion, Chuck mentioned to Ruth that money laundering was occurring in Tucson; however, he claimed that he was not involved in it. He also stated that the less she and the children knew about his activities, the better it would be for them. It is theorized that Chuck Morgan was killed by members of organized crime in the Tucson area. It is possible that the Mafia family that he worked for had him killed because he knew too much. One theory is that organized crime bosses put the word out that they wanted Chuck dead. A hit-man then told Chuck, so he came up with the money in order to buy the hit-man off. However, when the two met in the desert, the hit-man killed him anyway and took the money. This theory has not been confirmed.  
**Extra Notes:** This case originally aired on the February 7, 1990 episode.  
Although it was not mentioned in the segment, Chuck was a secret witness in an extensive land-fraud investigation and was interviewed about it in May 1977, shortly before his death. It is not known if this had anything to do with his death. Also not mentioned was that Chuck had been seen at several restaurants and motels on the west side of Tucson after his disappearance and before his death.  
**Results:** Unsolved. After the case aired, *Unsolved Mysteries* received several calls relating to Chuck's death. Don Deveraux investigated several leads that came up as a result of the program. He learned that Chuck was heavily involved in money laundering activities through his Tucson escrow company. From 1973 to his death in 1977, he was also involved in large gold and platinum transactions. He apparently received a large amount of money from these activities, and some of this money allegedly came from Southeast Asia. Deveraux discovered that Chuck kept duplicate records of the illicit transactions. Deveraux now believes that Chuck was killed because he still had these records.  
Three months after the broadcast, [Doug Johnston](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Doug_Johnston) was found shot to death in his car outside of his Phoenix office. Interestingly, he worked across the street from Deveraux's office, and drove an almost identical car. Deveraux now believes that he was supposed to be killed instead of Doug. A year after Doug's murder, Deveraux was contacted by a writer from D.C. named [Danny Casolaro](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Danny_Casolaro). He agreed to share with him the information that he had uncovered about Chuck's illegal gold transactions. However, Danny died suspiciously before he received the information. All three cases remain unsolved. Sadly, Chuck's widow, Ruth Morgan, died in 2006.

147,Bluest_waters,[],1641662243,"The brain illness in Canada is getting worse and is actually more serious than previously reported. 

https://gizmodo.com/frightening-new-details-emerge-about-mystery-brain-illn-1848321759

&gt;A possible cluster of a mysterious brain illness afflicting people in New Brunswick, Canada may be larger than officially reported, according to an investigation published by the Guardian earlier this week. As many as 150 people may have developed unexplained neurological symptoms dating back to 2013, including cases where people became sick after close contact with another victim. But it is not clear whether local health officials will conclude that any of these cases are truly connected, pending an upcoming report of theirs expected later this month.

Those are official figures. But turns out there is likely a lot more cases than that. 

&gt;**According to the Guardian, however, there have been many more similar cases unofficially documented by doctors**. Citing multiple sources, the Guardian reported that as many as 150 cases may be out there. In nine of these cases, a person developed symptoms following close contact with someone else similarly sick, often while caring for them. What’s more, younger people, who rarely develop these sorts of neurological symptoms, have been identified within and outside the official cluster.

Many people have suggest that the blue green alae toxin BMAA is to blame for this. So logically you would test the deceased for that toxin, right? 

Well....

&gt;The cases among close contacts suggest a common environmental factor. And there has been some speculation by experts that β-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA)—a toxin produced by blue-green algae—could be to blame. Some earlier research has shown that lobsters, a popular harvested food in the province, can potentially carry high levels of BMAA. ***But efforts by federal scientists to examine the brains of those deceased for BMAA, the Guardian reports, have so far not been allowed by the New Brunswick government***, despite families themselves wanting the tests to be done.

They are literally stopping scientists from diagnosing this illness. Why? Possibly because it would have a devastating impact on the local fishing industry. 

BMAA has been linked to both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 

&gt;BMAA can cross the blood–brain barrier in rats. It takes longer to get into the brain than into other organs, but once there, it is trapped in proteins, forming a reservoir for slow release over time.[12][13]

&gt;Mechanisms

&gt;Although the mechanisms by which ***BMAA causes motor neuron dysfunction and death*** are not entirely understood, current research suggests that there are multiple mechanisms of action. Acutely, BMAA can act as an excitotoxin on glutamate receptors, such as NMDA, calcium-dependent AMPA, and kainate receptors.[14][15] The activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 is believed to induce oxidative stress in the neuron by depletion of glutathione.[16]

&gt;BMAA can be misincorporated into nascent proteins in place of L-serine, possibly causing protein misfolding and aggregation, both hallmarks of tangle diseases, including **Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Lewy body disease**. In vitro research has shown that protein association of BMAA may be inhibited in the presence of excess L-serine.[17]","The mysterious brain illness in Canada is worse than official figures show, leading to allegations of a cover up. Meanwhile the government forbids scientists from testing brains of the deceased for the blue green algae toxin BMAA."
148,Environmental_War_62,[],1641594055,"So this is a case I heard about years ago and recently just popped back into my mind. It is a brazilian case, I'm not brazilian so if anyone wants to add/correct something feel free to do so. 

July 7, 2007. The body of 32 years old José Cicero Henrique was found in Paturis Park, he had his pants around his knees and had been shot in the head, he is considered to be the Maniac's first victim. All of the Maniac's other victims were also found in this Park, which was a common meeting point for gay men and male sex workers frequented the area at night, because of this the case is also referred as the Paturis Park Murders. Eleven of them were killed with one shot to the head, one victim was actually show twelve times and another one was beaten to death. Most of them were also found partially undressed, usually with their pants down. It was determined that the guns used in the crimes were a .38 and a .380.  I couldn't find the specific timeline with each death, but one article mentions the bodies were found in this park from July 2007 to August 2008.  

During the initial investigation, there was a man only referred as Leonardo, that I think is an important part. Leonardo went to Paturis Park to meet other men in a regular basis and he actually found three of the victims bodies. Obviously, this caught police's attention and he was considered a suspect, however he was cleared after he was tested for gunpower residue and the results came back negative. Apparently he also crossed paths with the maniac on one occasion. He said the night of August 2, 2008 he went to the Park at night as he usually did, there he came across a man a tanned man around 1,65 m and tried to flirt with him, the man reacted badly so Leonardo walked away. Minutes later he heard gunshots coming from the place he had seen the man, he went back there and found the body of 47 years old Miguel Gonçalves de Oliveira Filho, an article mentions he had several gunshots so I assume he was the one who was shot twelve times (some articles don't give any names so I had to piece together who is who based on the different sources I found). Leonardo then called the police, the article that published his testimony mentions the police had made a sketch of the suspect based on Leonardo's description but this sketch had not been released and I'm not sure if it ever was. The article also says Leonardo acted as a sort of intermediary between the police and the gay men that visited the park.   

Police also considered the Maniac to be responsible for the murder of 27 years old Pedro João Itavan Peixoto in Osasco, which is close to Carapicuíba. Peixoto was described as a ''travestie'' that went by the name of Pamela. Peixoto was found dead in a motel with a gunshot to the head, making them the only victim that was not killed in the Park. I couldn't find the exact date of their death but I did find an article about it from October 18, 2008, so they were killed after Oliveira Filho, making them the last known victim. An article published on December 2, 2008 mentions police had two possible suspects that could be the Maniac. Suspect#1 was a former sergeant wanted in connection to the murder of Pedro/Pamela, it says the two had checked in the motel together. Suspect#2 was a man who also had a military past and had killed six ''travesties'' in the 90's, which earned him the nickname ''the travesti killer'' and had also carried out his crimes with a .38 mm gun. Police eventually arrested a man named Jairo Francisco Franco on December 10, which based on all I have read, was suspect# 1 given he was a retired sergeant. Police suspected Franco to be Maniac based on witnesses testimonies, some articles and the Beyond the Rainbow episode on this mention there were two key witnesses, one put him in the park at the same time and at the same spot where one victim was killed (so I'm guessing this witness was Leonardo), the other one was a street seller that recognized Franco and claimed to have seen roaming in Paturis Park often. Despite this Franco was charged with only one murder, again the article that reported this did not name the victim but it did say it was victim# 13 so I'm guessing they were referring to the murder of Pedro/Pamela. Franco's trial ended in 2011 and he was acquitted from charges brought against him. No other suspect has been arrested or charged with the murders of the other twelve men. 

As for the motive, it seems pretty clear these were hate crimes. One of the detectives working on the case is quote as saying: ''In his (the Maniac's) mind he is doing a clean-up job. He doesn't likes homosexuals. He hates them.'' It has also been theorized the killer was homosexual himself, some sources do mention the victims indeed had some type of sexual encounter before being shot, this has lead to speculation that the killer took out his own self-loathing in his victims after having these encounters.  

This is pretty much all I have found this killer. A brazilian podcast called Café com Crime made an episode on this case, I tried listen to it but since I don't speak portuguese I couldn't really understand what was being said. Anyways, thanks for reading and happy new year.

...A place of not much note except to those who lived there – until the night of 23 November 1978 when a major crime was committed and Murwillumbah became the surprised scene of the biggest bank heist in Australia’s history. It was audacious, meticulous, consummately professional, old school. It has gone down in history as the perfect crime in which no one was physically hurt. In 43 years it has never been solved; an enduring mystery that has achieved folklore status in the small northern rivers town.

The Transecurity armoured truck which did a run of the banks between the Queensland border and Sydney was a familiar sight in Murwillumbah, sometimes stopping the traffic as armed guards unloaded it into the overnight holding bank. Every second Wednesday there would be a big payroll from the federal government on board to meet pension cheques and wages.

Sometime on the Wednesday night of the 23 November the locks at the back door of the bank were picked; there was no alarm. Using an electro-magnetic diamond-tipped drill which clamped on to the safe and allowed them to drill 18cm holes within 5mm of the crucial point in the locking mechanism they then fed through a medical cystoscope with wires to manipulate the tumblers in the safe’s locking mechanism. A fraction of a millimetre either way and they couldn’t have pulled it off...",They got the lot - the mystery of the biggest bank heist in Australia's history

This next line caught the eye of many long-time Bostonians: 

&gt;""Should you observe any individual who appears to be in distress, wandering alone late at night or dressed unsuitably for the weather, be sure to contact the police immediately"".

Since 2007, at least eight attractive men in their 20s have vanished on winter nights. Many of them were last seen underdressed and disoriented in the cold. 

All of their searches met a tragic end in the Charles River or Boston Harbor:

152,Far_Valuable5819,[],1641530086,"Today I was listening to my favorite true crime podcast, **Going West**.  If you have never listened to **Going West** run and do it now! Well after you finish reading this post.  You can't find a better podcast duo than the **Going West** hosts, Daphane Woolsoncroft and Heath Merryman.  The episode was a special one to celebrate their 3 year podcast anniversary, The Ruth Price 911 Call // Episode 162. 

I have to be honest, before today I had never heard the story of Ruth Price and the 911 call she placed. At the beginning of the call, Ruth begins to give her address as **3877** but is cut off by the 911 operator.  During this 911 call, Ruth presents herself as an elderly woman who is concerned about a man who knocks on her door saying he is looking for an apartment.  Ruth pauses after giving this information, then you hear a blood curdling scream and Ruth says something about not being able to breath.  

If you have never heard this 911 call, listen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrG1o8vESw).  **Please note that there is one of the most disturbing screams that you will ever hear in this call.**  

As I googled this 911 call multiple Reddit posts and even an [article](https://catacombsofcrime.medium.com/ruth-price-911-call-fact-or-fiction-an-examination-of-the-evidence-b0045fba7ed1) show up speculating if this 911 call was real or a some kind of hoax.  (Apparently this 911 call has been circulating the internet for a few decades. And first appeared in the late 80's early 90's.)  One theory was that it was created as a training call for 911 operators.   Over the years, people have tracked down possible Ruth Prices but have been unable to link them to this 911 call.

I however believe I found the missing evidence to link it to a Ruth Price mentioned by Daphane and Heath in their **Going West** episode. 

I'm do genealogy as a hobby and love to dig and do research.  (By the way, if anyone reading this is involved in genetic genealogy and want to offer me a job I'm in! A woman can dream.) To avoid taking down my Christmas tree I started an ancestry tree on the 3rd option that Daphane and Heath had mentioned, a Ruth Mildred Starr Price.

Ruth Mildred Starr was born in Pueblo, Colorado on December 7, 1913 to Thomas O Starr and Johanna Egler.  Ruth went to Central High School in Pueblo Colorado, see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SG4Cf-a4o3GA-HcGV5di1kDt-jxguuwm/view?usp=sharing) for a yearbook photo. Ruth Starr married William Walter Price and both were still listed as living in Pueblo, Colorado in 1935, but then can be found in a 1940 Census living in San Diego, California.  

I also found this Ruth in a 1973 San Diego City Directory living at **3877 N 35th Street** in San Diego.  (Remember that Ruth in the 911 call said she lived at 3877 before the 911 operator cut her off.)  

It appears that Ruth and William had two daughters and William passed away in 1972. 

During my research, I found a listing for an obituary for Ruth M Price in May of 1994 in the San Diego Union-Tribune. The entire obituary wasn't being shown so I went looking for the full obituary.   Instead I found a Ruth M Price listed in a newspaper section called *Assaults* on November 3,1980 in the San Diego Evening Tribune.  In this newspaper clipping it says Ruth M. Price was assaulted on the **3800 block of 35th Street**! This newspaper clipping fits the Ruth Price 911 call perfectly!! You can find a screenshot of this newspaper clipping [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRlMRer3GZVRF3XbbOXeZgx4cQzpJ3Bd/view?usp=sharing). 

I truly believe that this is the missing piece that identifies THEE Ruth Price of that unknown 911 call.  It wasn't a hoax or a 911 training call, that blood curdling scream was unfortunately very real!  The good news is Ruth even being older in age, fought off her attacker and lived for another 14 years.   
One more note is that in reading another reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qp9b7e/the_murder_of_ruth_price_a_lengthy_debunking/), most likely this 911 call isn't really a 911 call. Apparently, there was no 911 in San Diego in 1980 so most likely Ruth Price was talking to an operator of some kind.  Maybe she dialed ""0"" or had reached the police station.   

Thoughts?  Did I find the missing link to bring an end to this unresolved mystery?

I still have some sources to check, and one or two people to talk to who may have some information, as well as an email in to the Iredell County Sheriffs dept. I hope to discover more, but I can't be sure there's anything more to uncover.

**December 9th, 1976. Howards Bridge road in the rural community of Union Grove, North Carolina.**   
Just after lunch time, local resident named Claude Howard discovers the nude body of a deceased female on the edge of a farm field just off the main road near the bridge the road is named for. How and why she was there and just who left her there is still a mystery to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Daria Elaine Smith was born in Nottoway, Virginia on New Years Day, 1953.**I haven’t been able to find much about her early life, but by the time high school rolls around she’s living with her parents in Lanham-Seabrook, Maryland attending DuVal High School, which today is a prominent public magnet school.

Daria seems to have been a good student, and was involved with numerous activities, including the school’s forensic league and numerous musical groups. She also was a student government representative.She graduated from DuVal in 1970, and disappears from the public record until 1973, when she enlists in the US Army and is sent to Viet Nam.Of note, at the time of her enlistment women could only serve in a few capacities, and due to her rank at discharge, was most likely an army nurse. Her enlistment ended May 2nd, 1975. It’s highly likely that she met her future husband Charles Ray Wade during her time in the service. He also served in Viet Nam and was discharged as a PFC (private first class). Wade was originally from Wilson, NC.

The couple are married 15th of March, 1975, three months before Daria leaves the army. In the end, whatever drew Charles and Daria together wasn’t enough to keep them together. Though there was no legal divorce, the couple separated fairly quickly.

Based on what records are available, it’s believed that post discharge and pre separation, the Wades moved to Salisbury together attend Livingstone College, an historically black Christian school. It’s possible this was accomplished using funds from the GI Bill.

Daria’s parents either follow her to NC or had already moved here, though I suspect it’s the former, as they are living at 721 Old Plank road, which is on the street behind that runs behind the college.

Neither of the Wades ever appear in the Livingstone College yearbooks. Daria would not have been there long enough and Charles must have dropped out after his estranged wife’s death.

&amp;#x200B;

**Midday, December 9th, 1976** Charles Howard noticed a woman’s fur coat laying in the muddy track of a side road that led to a farm field. As he stopped to investigate, he also found shoes and a pair of dungaree style pants with a black belt before realizing that they belonged to the body of a young black woman, who was laying not far away in the middle of the road, near a mud puddle.

Daria Wade was nude, but retained curlers in her hair, earrings, a ring on each hand, and a third ring was found on the ground nearby.

To the Iredell County Sheriff’s department, who responded to the scene, there were no obvious sign of what had killed her. The NC State Bureau of Investigation, who were called in to assist had the same experience. Wade had a scratch across her back and a noticeable bruise on her hip, but no signs of major trauma or injury. There was no ID or a pocketbook, and it would be a day or better before the hard work of Lt. Detective Deane Barnette paid off, and the young woman they found in the mud would have her name back.

Tom Thompson, the sheriff of Iredell county was quick to tell the Statesville Record &amp; Landmark at the time “That place is used as a lover’s lane and for drinking parties”.

I have been unable to substantiate that claim with anyone in the area. At any rate, it seems highly unlikely a nearly impassable muddy wallow would be the scene of that kind of carrying on, and seems even more unlikely an African American girl would, in the year 1976 with race relations being what they were, be out partying with the local farm boys of north Iredell.

He also noted that a witness or witnesses had seen a light colored Chevrolet station wagon in the area that night. It’s unknown if, and probably unlikely the vehicle was ever found.

The weather the night before had been particularly cold, with the temperature remaining below 20 degrees Fahrenheit from midnight until about 8 or 9 AM, a couple hours before Wade’s body was discovered. An autopsy performed in Raleigh would eventually conclude the cause of death as exposure, but would also indicate that Wade had a blood alcohol level of .18, which would be considered in most people “very drunk”, and a good bit higher than the legal state threshold of .10. It was also casually noted that there was “some evidence of drugs in the body”, but this is never clarified or further explained. The only other evidence of note was that Wade had scratches on her knees, as if she had been crawling on the ground before her death. There was no evidence of sexual assault.

No obituary is available for Wade online (but I hope to check Rowan county's archives for the local paper soon, which are not digitized), but her death must have been a nightmare for her parents. She would be buried with honors in the Salisbury National Cemetery, her headstone noting her service to her country in Viet Nam.

After an article on December 11th noting the autopsy results, no other word is ever published about Wade’s death in Iredell county again. She is either purposely forgotten or the case goes cold.

Perhaps Sherriff Thompson thought enough attention had been paid to the accidental death of a drunken black girl from another county. Perhaps there simply was no other course of discovering what happened with no further leads or evidence to pursue. Any attempt to understand what happened and why would be speculation.

But it has to be noted that someone brought Wade to that muddy field in Iredell county, over an hour from home, and completely off the main road. Someone left her there in the below-freezing temperatures, and someone is owed some blame for what happened to her.

Who this party or parties might be is not likely to ever be known. It would of course be no great leap of the imagination to think that Wade’s estranged husband must have been looked at, but he was never charged, and so whatever evidence or suspicions there might have been (if any) it would not have been enough to pursue charges.

The exact events that lead to Daria Wade’s death are unknown, but I would like to make a few conjectures based on what evidence there is.

**Speculation.**  
Terminal burrowing and more importantly in this case, paradoxical undressing are well established phenomena that are seen in cases of hypothermia, and Wade shows signs of both, having been found nude and with abrasions on her knees.

I have to believe that whoever brought her to Iredell county had planned something untoward. Either abandoning her, as happened, or something far more appalling. Whatever the case, I would deduce that the bruise on her hip might have been a result of that action- perhaps suffered as she was shoved or kicked out of a vehicle. Left there in the dark woods, drunk, alone, she wouldn’t have had much of a chance of surviving the night, and ultimately didn’t.

I also want to say that the chance of accidentally finding the location where she was left is almost impossible. Most of the highways that would make the drive shorter today were not present in 1976, and the path from Salisbury would be across numerous rural roads, making numerous turns. To randomly arrive on Howards Bridge road in the middle of the night is a near impossibility. While the road does start at NC highway 901 just in front of Union Grove school, the road itself only goes further into country, really going nowhere unless someone makes several specific turns.

So why would someone have known the area? The late 1970's were the raucous end of the Union Grove Fiddle Convention, an old time/bluegrass festival that had been taking place since the 1920's,but which had devolved into drugs, fighting, and if the rumors can be believed, rape. People came from all over the country to attend the festival, and in it's last years, there were a lot of unsavory types coming too.

I believe it was the year before Wade was found that the Hells Angels were barricaded from entering the festival by the Iredell County Sherriff's Department. In fact, there's a (locally) famous picture of deputies lined up across NC highway 901, blocking the Angels from coming down the road.  
They are standing right in front of where Howard Bridge meets NC-901.

**Purposely Forgotten**  
I think Wade's case was likely abandoned without much effort. She had a lot working against her. She was an outsider. She was immoral in many people's estimation, due to her autopsy. She was African American. And that last one is one I don't bandy about carelessly, but I know this area, I know people who were alive at the time, and the death of one drunk black girl probably didn't elicit much sympathy.

She was last known to be in the company of one Gregory Kelly, a violent repeat offender who was later convicted of sex trafficking and died in prison in 2020 of COVID-19. 

She left behind a sister and two children who had searched for her extensively but never found her. Unfortunately her mother died just two months ago, and never learned that her daughter had been found or identified.

The DNA Doe Project hasn't announced the identification yet, but the Kent County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that DDP handled the identification. Detective Dustin Cook called the process ""incredible"".

155,claustrophobicdragon,[],1641516625,"The night of January 5, 2021, an unknown individual placed two pipe bombs in Washington, D.C. Their intended targets were the headquarters of America's two major political parties, with one device each planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committees. While both bombs were discovered before they exploded, the FBI has described them as ""viable and could have been detonated, resulting in serious injury or death."" Reports [have surfaced today](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/06/harris-was-inside-dnc-on-jan-6-when-pipe-bomb-was-discovered-outside-526695) that then-Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris was inside the DNC headquarters when the bomb was discovered and was evacuated by US Secret Service.

While hundreds of people have been arrested and prosecuted for their role in the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, no one has been named as a suspect in the attempted bombings. The FBI has released several different surveillance videos that capture the unknown suspect's movements in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on the night of January 5. Those videos can be found [here](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/press-releases/fbi-washington-field-office-releases-video-and-additional-information-regarding-the-pipe-bomb-investigation-090821).

Analysis of the footage has allowed federal investigators to publish the following description of the suspect:

&gt; ""The person who placed these bombs wore a face mask, glasses, a grey hooded sweatshirt, gloves, and black and light grey Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo. The suspect used a backpack to transport each of the devices.

Unfortunately, the trail seems to have grown a bit cold. The Associated Press [reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/capitol-riot-suspects-sought-fbi-year-82084855) this week that ""investigators have interviewed more than 900 people, collected 39,000 video files and examined more than 400 leads"" but are yet to turn up a suspect. Many news reports suggest that the FBI is turning to gait analysis and looking into the Nike shoes that the suspect wore to try and identify them. Despite so much visual evidence (and a joint FBI-ATF reward of $100,000) out there, there remain key questions that are unanswered--such as the suspect's gender, or whether or not the pipe bombs were even connected to the violence of the next day. One year later, it seems that we're still very far from answering the question as to who is responsible for the attempted bombings of the DNC and RNC.

Beginning in May 1940, three dismembered bodies were found in abandoned train cars in nearby McKees Rocks. The following two years would see 5 more dismembered bodies found either on nearby train tracks or floating in the rivers. These murders were strikingly similar to those of the Cleveland Torso Killer who is regarded to have stopped killing just one year prior. Elliott Ness and other Cleveland detectives did come down to look into the first three murders but they were never officially linked. Of the eight murders, none have been solved.

Two years after the 1989 murder of Anthony Michalowski, the body of Michael Hickmott was found dismembered and thrown in various trash bins around Pittsburgh's Shadyside neighborhood. 

He was quickly linked to Robert Wayne Marshall, an unemployed man who described himself as a 'neo-nazi vampire' and had disappeared right after the murder. He would commit suicide in an abandoned factory but did not admit anything in his suicide note. With no evidence police could not positively say he committed the murder. The FBI became involved and stated due to the brutal modus operandi, Marshall had almost certainly killed before.

MANCHESTER, N.H. —
An investigation into a missing girl who was last seen in New Hampshire over two years ago has led to the arrest of the child's father, officials announced.

Rewards totaling $33,000 are being offered for information leading to 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery. She was last seen at a Manchester home in October 2019, when she was 5.

Adam Montgomery, 31, was arrested Tuesday on charges including second-degree assault connected to an incident in 2019 involving the missing girl, interference with custody and endangering the welfare of a child. The assault charge is a felony.

""Although an arrest has been made, the search for Harmony continues,"" New Hampshire Attorney General John M. Formella wrote in a statement.

Adam Montgomery waived his arraignment Wednesday in the Hillsborough County Superior Court North. According to an affidavit, he is suspected of hitting her in the face and claimed that he brought her to live with her mother.

Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg said Harmony was in the child welfare system in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. It was New Hampshire's Division of Children, Youth and Families that notified police last week that Harmony was missing and last seen two years ago, the chief said.

A source told WCVB sister station WMUR that Harmony had been reunited with her father after spending time in foster care in Massachusetts.

An affidavit from the case indicates that Harmony's mother called Manchester Police Department to report the girl missing on Nov. 18, 2021. The department contacted DCYF to get contact information about the father, but was unable to find him at the addresses provided.

More than a month later, on Dec. 27, 2021, DCYF contacted police to report they were unable to locate Harmony. The affidavit says that was when the department initiated its investigation.

During the investigation, a detective spoke with Adam Montgomery's uncle. The document says he had first-hand knowledge that Harmony's eye injury was caused by her father in 2019.

Adam Montgomery has three younger children with his current wife and all were accounted for by investigators. The document indicates that he had not been living with his wife since late October.

Investigators wrote that they found Adam Montgomery sleeping in a car with his new girlfriend in Manchester on New Year's Eve. In subsequent interviews, the affidavit indicates that the father made contradictory statements about his missing daughter or refused to answer.

According to the Essex District Attorney's Office, Adam Montgomery has a prior criminal history in Massachusetts. The DA's office confirmed to NewsCenter 5 that in March of 2014, Montgomery was charged in Haverhill District Court with shooting a Haverhill man in the head after he came to the city to buy drugs. Police charged Montgomery with armed robbery and armed assault to murder in connection with the incident, which happened the night of Jan. 24, 2014. He was also charged with carrying a firearm without a license and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building.

Authorities said Adam Montgomery pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced on Sept. 9, 2014, and he was sentenced to serve 18 months in the Middleton House of Correction.

Manchester police have created a dedicated tip line for the search for Harmony. Anyone with information is asked to call or text 603-203-6060.

""Help us find this little girl,"" Aldenberg said. ""Someone knows something. Do what is right and call in. I cannot emphasize this enough. Someone out there knows something.""

On Sunday, Manchester police searched a home at 77 Gilford St. in Manchester, which is where Montgomery used to live. Aldenberg said the owner of that home has no involvement in the case, but noted she has been cooperative with police and has assisted them in their investigation.

A person who saw the search said that a police dog went through the home and did not find anything. That same person also said police dug up a corner of the yard, but they did not appear to find anything.

Investigators said they think Harmony has blond hair, blue eyes and is blind in her right eye, so she may be wearing glasses.

Aldenberg said Monday that Manchester police are treating this case as a rescue mission and not a recovery mission.

""For now, we have to operate under the assumption that she is alive and well somewhere, and that somebody knows something,"" he said.[Article](https://www.wcvb.com/article/missing-harmony-montgomery-investigation-arrest-adam-montgomery-new-hampshire-jan-5-2022/38674178)",Father of missing New Hampshire child Harmony Montgomery arrested
161,Bunnystrawbery,[],1641420744,"The Fouke Monster first made local headlines in 1971, when it was reported to have attacked the home of Bobby and Elizabeth Ford on May 2, 1971.

According to Elizabeth Ford, the creature, which she initially thought was a bear, reached through a screen window that night while she was sleeping on a couch. It was chased away by her husband and his brother Don. During the alleged encounter, the Fords fired several gun shots at the creature and believed that they had hit it, though no traces of blood were found. An extensive search of the area failed to locate the creature, but three-toed footprints were found close to the house, as well as scratch marks on the porch and damage to a window and the house's siding. According to the Fords, they had heard something moving around outside late at night several nights prior but, having lived in the house for less than a week, had never encountered the creature before.

The creature was allegedly sighted again on May 23, 1971, when three people, D. C. Woods, Jr., Wilma Woods, and Mrs. R. H. Sedgass, reported seeing an ape-like creature crossing U.S. Highway 71. More sightings reports were made over the following months by local residents and tourists, who found additional footprints. The best known footprints were found in a soybean field belonging to local filling station owner Scott Keith. They were scrutinized by game warden Carl Galyon, who was unable to confirm their authenticity. Like the Ford prints, they appeared to indicate that the creature had only three toes.

The incident began to attract substantial interest after news spread about the Ford sighting. The Little Rock, Arkansas, radio station KAAY posted a $1,090 bounty on the creature. Several attempts were made to track the creature with dogs, but they were unable to follow its scent. When hunters began to take interest in the Fouke Monster, Miller County Sheriff Leslie Greer was forced to put a temporary ""no guns"" policy in place in order to preserve public safety. In 1971, three people were fined $59 each ""for filing a fraudulent monster report.""

After an initial surge of attention, public interest in the creature decreased until it gained national recognition in 1973 when Charles B. Pierce released a docudrama horror film about the creature in 1972, The Legend of Boggy Creek.

By late 1974, interest had waned again and sightings all but stopped; only to begin again in March 1978 when tracks were reportedly found by two brothers prospecting in Russellville, Arkansas. There were also sightings in Center Ridge, Arkansas. On June 26 of that same year, a sighting was reported in Crossett, Arkansas. During this period the creature was blamed for missing livestock and attacks on several dogs.

“After \[the juror’s\] clear, repeated expressions of actual bias as to the precise nature of the allegations at the heart of this trial and evidence which would be introduced, we cannot conclude that juror \[number\] 40 was sufficiently rehabilitated such that Talbott was provided a fair and impartial jury.”

The court’s ruling included transcripts from portions of voir dire, where the juror referenced growing up in a violent household.

“I don’t know how I would feel, being shown evidence of something that could bring up memories that I have worked to get rid of,” said the juror. “I also have a daughter, and I think that might also play a part in how I might feel. If there was some action taken towards a young woman, I might take that personally and not be able to be impartial.”

Jurors heard the violent and gruesome details behind the murders for which Talbott was accused.

According to court records, Cook and Cuylenborg left Victoria, British Columbia, on Nov. 18, 1987, to retrieve furnace parts in Seattle for Cook’s father. On Nov. 24, Cuylenborg’s body was discovered on a steep embankment in a rural area of Skagit County. Her pants were removed, and her bra pulled above her breasts. Someone beat her and shot her in the back of the head at close range.

The following day, the couple’s van was found with blood evidence and Cuylenborg’s missing pants inside.

On Nov. 26, 1987, Cook’s partially covered body was found in a rural area in Snohomish County. He sustained blunt force trauma to the head and was strangled to death with a dog collar and twine. The killer also shoved a pack of cigarettes down his throat.

Investigators collected DNA from the van and Cuylenborg’s body.

In 2018, investigators tested the DNA using genetic genealogy, an up-and-coming science that was still relatively new at the time. The testing, made famous with the ultimate capture of [Golden State Killer](https://www.oxygen.com/all/golden-state-killer) Joseph DeAngelo that same year, helps law enforcement create suspect profiles through familial DNA links developed using genetic genealogy databases. Talbott was identified as a possible source.

Investigators tailed him and collected a coffee cup he discarded, ultimately tying him to the murders.

Talbott, a construction worker and truck driver who lived near where Cook’s body was found, was arrested at a job site in May 2018. He was [sentenced](https://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/william-talbott-ii-sentenced-life-slaying-jay-cook-tanya-van-cuylenborg) to life in prison.

Monday’s decision to overturn the murder convictions came as a shock to prosecutors, according to [KOMO News](https://komonews.com/news/local/cold-case-murder-convictions-surprisingly-overturned-after-appeal).

“We’re disappointed as an office, to say the least, and I’m sure the family is similarly disappointed,” said Snohomish County Prosecuting Attorney Adam Cornell. “The fact that the trial court did not dismiss that juror for cause impacted Mr. Talbott’s right to a fair trial, and here we are.”

Cornell said he plans to appeal the state Supreme Court before a Jan. 5, 2022 deadline, according to the Seattle-based news outlet. Failing that, his office will attempt to re-try Talbott.

“This isn’t over yet,” said Cornell. “We’re going to continue to fight for justice for these families.”",First Man Convicted Of Murder On Genetic Genealogy Evidence Has Verdict Overturned

167,eastofliberty,[],1641338696,"The Toronto Star has been granted court-approved access to police investigative documents in the now four-year-old unsolved Barry and Honey Sherman Murder case, and the documents are released in chronological order, not all at once. Last week, we reported that homicide detectives in 2019 had compiled a list of cell phone numbers of “key persons” in the case and that they were seeking court approval to get a tower.”dump’ of all mobile communications surrounding Barry and Honey the night they died, hoping to match up with a stalker. In today’s episode, the Star reveals what the police learned in 2020 and where the investigation went.

In September 2020, the Toronto Police Department investigating the murders of the two billionaires used terms such as “walking man” and “killer” in their investigation notes, describing the belief that an unknown “man” with an unusual gait was their prime suspect.

As described in the search warrant and production order requests that police made to obtain cell phone tracking data, detectives now had a “working theory.”

“The theory is that investigators believe that both Bernard and Honey Sherman were murdered and that the perpetrator, presumably a man, is referred to as the ‘walking man’. that can be seen on video surveillance” was their prime suspect, one detective wrote in a request to the court for permission to conduct additional analyzes of mobile communications data.

“Any patterns emerging could reveal that the Shermans were under surveillance prior to their murders or could reveal the identity of the ‘running man’,” police wrote.

Barry Sherman, founder of pharmaceutical company Apotex, and his wife Honey were murdered in their home in Toronto between 9 p.m. and midnight on Wednesday, December 13, 2017. Their bodies were discovered 36 hours later by a real estate agent who showed the house. Once police moved from a homicide-suicide theory to double homicide (six weeks into the case), investigators focused on a series of video footage collected from neighborhood cameras that showed a man walking to the Sherman property and “suspicious” amount. time there, and then leave the same way he had come. Investigative files released by a court reveal that police believe this is Sherman’s “murderer”.

The identity of the walking man remains a mystery to this day.

At a police press conference in December, Det. Sergeant Brandon Price told the media using a technique known as: “photogrammetry” they had determined that the person was between five and a half meters tall. What Price didn’t tell the media is that according to police documents, it took nearly two years to estimate the person’s height, an analysis that took just two weeks. Photogammetry uses known objects in an area (a tree, fire hydrant, etc.) and other factors to estimate the height and weight of a person captured on video or photograph.

As the newly released documents describe, police theorized that the walking man was in mobile communications with people who were “key persons” in the case. Or that the walking man was in mobile communication with a nearby intermediary who in turn was in contact with an interested party. The documents do not indicate the possibility that the individual communicated via a two-way mobile radio, which would not be picked up by a cell tower.

To understand how the Toronto Police Department investigated this case, set aside images from detective shows such as the Baltimore Police Drama. Murder life on the street, or the British police procedural show Scott &amp; Bailey, with scenes of detectives pounding the sidewalk and knocking on doors. The only full-time detective on the Sherman case, Det. Constable Dennis Yim was charged with investigating cellular communications.

First, they collected about 300 cell phone numbers of the Sherman family, friends, business associates, and people who worked for the Shermans. Those numbers and their names went into a spreadsheet. According to the documents, these were figures that came from various sources. First, interviews the police conducted – detectives asked people for their cell phone numbers or the number of people the interviewee speculated had committed the murders. Declassified documents show that the Sherman family and some friends pointed the finger at three individuals who were not named in the documents (police say they have found no evidence that these individuals were involved). Police also received 18 cell phone numbers from tips the public gave directly to the Toronto Police Department; 41 issues from tips to a committed Sherman murder line that put the police on the case for a year; and 184 numbers relayed by the Sherman family’s private investigation team led by criminal defense attorney Brian Greenspan.

Then, in early 2019, police went to Ontario Court of Justice Judge Leslie Pringle asking for permission to obtain: “tower dumps” from Bell, Telus, Rogers and Freedom Mobile for areas around Sherman’s and Apotex’s home the night of the murders, as well as weeks and in some cases months prior to the murders. How this works is relatively simple: when a cell phone is used to make a call or receive a text message, it communicates with a nearby cell tower, creating a ‘handshake’. This data is specific to an area – think of drawing an invisible electronic box around a property or part of the street.

As the recently declassified September 2020 documents show, the police warrant was granted on the condition that the police use strict protocol to preserve the privacy of innocent people whose mobile communication patterns were picked up during the massive tower collapse.

The next step was to run a comparison of those about 300 “person of interest” numbers and the tower dump. This was at least a partial success. Sometime in 2020, the police began to get “hits” – persons of interest appeared in the tower dumps.

That prompted the police to conduct “background investigations … on the telephone numbers, from telephone records obtained through production order, that were common for the results of the tower dump’s transmission data.”


 
It is likely that most if not all of these figures found in the “tower dumps” are people innocent of the crime but who happened to be in the area at the time. What the documents don’t reveal (due to redactions) is whether police identified “pings” to cell towers that approximate the “walking man” movements and whether those pings match the long list of “key people.”

The term “important persons” is a term the police use to describe, quite literally, someone “important” in a case, but not someone who is a suspect. Police need evidence of suspected crime to raise the status to ‘suspicious’, which they recently did with the unknown ‘walking man’.

The police documents have been heavily redacted in the portions describing these hits – all persons of interest showing up in the tower dumps have been obscured.

Of additional interest in the newly released documents is the fact that something the police discovered in the tower dumps prompted them to make a comparison with information the police received in an international production order they obtained in 2020. The Canadian Police Service, through the federal government, can collect information overseas with 35 countries covered by what is known as a “mutual legal assistance treaty”.

The latest page of police documents released to the Star on Monday has a completely blacked-out section with the headline: “Relevant results from legal aid treaties.”

From the Star’s ongoing investigation, which includes reviewing more than 1,000 pages of documents that have been released, police theorize that the walking man or anyone he communicated with was outside Canada at the time, or left Canada after the murders.

With each new batch of documents released, more information comes out about the case, including the crime scene.

In these newly declassified documents, designated by the police as ITOs #11 and #12 (an ITO is an “information to obtain a search warrant or a production warrant”, we get a clearer picture of the crime scene than in previous declassified documents). For the first time, the belts looped around the Sherman’s neck are identified as “black belts.”

Their arms were behind them and their bodies were held up by black belts wrapped around their necks and tied to a railing about “three feet (just under a meter) above the pool’s deck. The documents show that the Shermans stood with their backs to the pool, their feet almost against the wall on one side of the pool. Barry’s wrists were “tied up” at one point, but no ties or other shackles were found at the crime scene.

The documents also reveal for the first time a reference to “bloodstains on the victims,” ​​an observation by a forensic officer that is not explained further. De Star has learned from her own research that the blood at the scene was relatively small, most likely coming from Honey’s nose as a result of the “ligature compression” on her neck that killed her. Honey had a small spot on her right eye. Barry had no markings on his face and his glasses sat neatly on his nose. Both Shermans were wearing their shoes.

And police have also revealed that Honey’s last known email was sent sometime on Wednesday night the Shermans died, a harmless request to mydrap.com, a supplier of cotton napkins, asking if they ship products to both Canada and the U.S. to ship. Honey was known for his fun functions with family and friends during the holiday season.

ATLANTA — The cold case of an Atlanta 14-year-old who was raped and murdered has been solved by homicide investigators almost 26 years later.
On June 7, 1995, Nacole Smith was killed in the woods on the way to school in southwest Atlanta. Police said a man sexually assaulted her and shot her twice in the face.
Atlanta investigators announced Tuesday that the suspect has finally been identified.


Using genealogy and forensic technology, the cold case unit connected the DNA of Nacole’s alleged killer to a man who died in hospice care of liver and kidney failure in August 2021.
Nacole’s mother said she will always live knowing she didn’t get to confront her daughter’s killer.
“I never imagined this person would be deceased. So many unanswered questions I had for him,” Acquenellia Smith said. “I’ll live with this pain for the rest of my life. Just take it one day a time. There’s nothing more I can say right now. My feelings are all over the place. There’s not a pill that can take that pain away.”
Police said at the news conference that they would not release the suspect’s name because they do not want to give his name any relevance.
Former detectives who worked the case and investigators credited the bravery of a 13-year-old victim who was raped by the suspect nine years later in 2004.
The East Point girl was pulled into the woods, raped and escaped. She was able to give detectives a description of the man for a composite sketch.
The victim identified herself Tuesday as Betty Brown. Brown said she never thought she would be speaking but didn’t want to hide or live in pain anymore.
“He is no longer out there able to do the things that he did to me and Nacole and to others,” Brown said.
Brown added that she felt conflicted about the outcome and doesn’t want to let her rape control her life anymore.
But she also wants the suspect’s family to know the pain that her family felt for the past 18 years.
“To know the man who you loved, you respected did something so horrible to me and Nacole, I want you to live in that. I want you to wear that like I did. Like I do every day of my life,” Brown said.
“I’m mad I didn’t get that opportunity to face him and look him in his eyes.”

Retired Atlanta police Detective Vince Velazquez worked both Smith and Brown’s cases.

He said the department and East Point police put a lot of effort and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars into identifying the suspect.
Velazquez said they put the composite sketch on “America’s Most Wanted” and billboards and spoke with hundreds of people around the country.
Velazquez worked the case until his retirement in 2017. Detective Scott Demeester took over the case and said it took three years to find a person of interest and get his DNA.
The final breakthrough came through around Christmas 2021. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s forensics team matched the DNA profile to the suspect in both rapes.
“I was just glad to be able to make that phone call to Mrs. Smith. It was an emotional phone call,” Demeester said.
Velazquez and Demeester kept in touch with Brown and Smith’s family throughout the years.
“I thank you detectives for sticking with me through all these years, checking on me and making sure I’m OK. I appreciate you because I needed that,” Brown told investigators.","Cold case rape, murder of Atlanta 14-year-old solved with help from suspect’s other victim"
171,MaddiKate,[],1641325542,"Hello, I am back with a major update on the disappearance of Kyrstyn Dunlap-Bosse. I wrote about her case approx. two months ago, which you can read about in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qyio13/the_1994_disappearance_of_krystyn_dunlapbosse/). The tl;dr is that the Boise teenager was involved in an abusive, inappropriate relationship with a man 10 years her senior, Chares ""Corey"" Castro. Krystyn ran away from home in October 1994, but kept contact with her friends until mid-Dec 1994, when she vanished after taking a trip with Castro. 

In the time since Krystyn disappeared, Castro was charged and convicted of a sexual offense towards another minor in 1998. Since then, he has been a convicted sex offender. Up until yesterday, he was living on a ranch in rural Murphy, Idaho. He and his then-wife owned a hobby ranch aimed at children with mental and developmental health concerns (why Castro was allowed around children, even while being compliant, is anyone's guess). There are rumors that he has abused more women and girls and that he and his wife were currently in the process of a divorce.

Yesterday at around 3:30pm, Owyhee County police went to Castro's residence to serve him a civil protection order. It is unclear why, but the local rumor mill believes this has to do with his estranged wife. When the police arrived, Castro allegedly charged at them with a weapon and refused to put the weapon down when ordered. After refusing to put down his weapon, the police shot and killed him. He was 54 years old. This is still a developing story, I will update as more info comes in.

On one hand, I can't say I grieve this man's loss. Even if he had nothing to do with Krystyn's disappearance, he has known victims (with convictions) prior to and after her disappearance (some sexual, some not). On the other hand, it's unfortunate that he likely took whatever happened to Krystyn to his grave.

What is interesting is that, while it is believed that the protection order has to do with his ongoing divorce, there has been a recent interest in Krystyn's case. Her family and friends spent much of late 2021 bringing her case to the media and providing new details to the public. As recently as two months ago, Castro told the media that he was cleared by a polygraph test. His death comes at an interesting time.

172,Bottle_of_fantaa,[],1641314933,"So, I’m currently on the bus home, and stumbled upon [this article](https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-new-hampshire-girl-harmony-montgomery) 

It honestly shocked me. How can no one report a five year old missing for two years, not even friends of the family noticed she was gone? No one at school? I mean, I guess if she was in pre-school it would be harder to notice her absence. Because I don’t believe pre-school is required for most kids. However, it’s still odd.

Sadly, I do think she’s in a bad, abusive, and/or neglectful family situation seeing that no one has reported her missing. The article does not go into much detail about her home life. However, on the surface that seems to be the case.

A quote from the article states, “Harmony Montgomery was last seen in October 2019 when she was 5 years old, the Manchester Police Department said Friday in a news release. Police said the circumstances of Harmony's long absence ""are very concerning,"" and that detectives have been investigating ""non-stop"" since first learning the child was missing last weeks”

It’s relieving  to know that her disappearance isn’t being swept under the rug by authorities. But it’s still saddening nonetheless

She got pregnant, and, I believe, had collaborated with him to murder the husband to collect his $400,000 life insurance. I was a young student at the time and not till years later did I see it. It was their eyes that gave them away. I walked in to a place well frequented by local police and saw the ""new"" couple there. Their eyes wide displaying fear. You don't see those eyes often, they are very rare, so when you do they are etched perfectly in your mind. Why would they fear me? I barely knew them. I didn't find out any of the details until later. The husband and new boyfriend went on a hike, a place known for people to fall from, since it was on a mountain whose trail was hugged by cliffs. He ... fell. Of course the police wouldn't properly investigate, again it was at a local law enforcement place that I saw them, interacting with the police as if they are we all friends.

I know what those two did. I have thought of telling the family, but I do not know them and it will only bring up more pain for them, and I have no proof. I cant tell the police for obvious reasons. How can I proof him ""losing his footing"" versus forceful push off the trial. How can I proof the motive of $400,000 and illegitimate child. I can tell you this, when you know someone has done wrong, it stays with you, years later bubbling to the surface.

**Patricia Cavallaro, 57, has been identified as a woman found partially buried in the California desert nearly three decades ago, authorities said Monday.**  **(Riverside County District Attorney's Office )**

At the time of her discovery, investigators with the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department were unable to ID Cavallaro, the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office said. An autopsy determined that she died from homicidal violence. 

""Because authorities were unable at the time to identify the victim and due to a lack of leads into what may have happened, this became a cold case,"" the DA's office said in a statement. 

Investigators determined that she was killed elsewhere and buried in the desert, citing a lack of evidence near where she was found. 

In an effort to identify Cavallaro, her DNA was entered into the state Justice Department Missing and Unidentified Persons System. 

After being unable to find a match, the District Attorney's Office's Regional Cold Case Homicide Team took over the investigation. A team sent a sample of the remains to a laboratory in Texas. 

Using her genetic information, investigators tracked down Cavallaro's son, who provided a DNA sample. An analysis indicated the remains were most likely his mother's. 

Cavallaro's husband reported her missing in 2001, telling police she ""walked away"" and was never seen again, the newspaper reported. He died in 2017.

175,EchtGeenSpanjool,[],1641257381,"  **The New Year’s Murder and Bureau Dupin – a brief overview**

On January 1st, 2013, a passerby walking his dog in the morning discovers a horrific sight: a dead body, right next to one of the houses on the Berghemseweg in the Dutch town of Oss. It quickly becomes apparent that she has become the victim of a crime. Nobody in the area seems to know who the dead woman is, and it takes a few days before she is identified as Marja Nijholt, a 48-year-old woman from the Dutch city of Enschede, who only arrived in Oss a day earlier. But why did she end up in Oss, over 100km (or a 2-hour train ride) away from her home? As the police investigates the timeline of this murder, they discover an intricate and curious case… 

&amp;#x200B;

The murder of Marja Nijholt, also dubbed the “New Year’s Murder”, puzzled law enforcement and civilians alike. After 18 months, the investigation was dialed way back in 2014, until a civilian initiative formed in 2020 pooled their efforts to help the police solve the case. The civilian collective, called Bureau Dupin after Edgar Allan Poe’s detective character, has since been working together with law enforcement to find a breakthrough in the case. The Bureau, fronted by former cop and data science professor Peter de Kock, has since investigated thousands of phone calls, text messages and has produced a 6-part podcast discussing the mysterious murder of Marja Nijholt. Their work, most notably said podcast, has been a huge help in creating this write-up. 

&amp;#x200B;

There already was a write-up on this case a few years ago, but seeing all the work Bureau Dupin has done, as well as the fact this is a fascinating case, I think another discussion about it is very much in place. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Knowing Marja Nijholt**

*Note: taken nearly in full from Bureau Dupin podcast*

Marja grew up with a brother and a sister, but at a young age her parents divorced. The role of her biological mother Kristel was filled by her new stepmom, Gemma. Soon, another sister was born. Kristel describes young Marja as “very calm, sweet child. She needed a lot of love.” Kristel eventually came out as lesbian, however this only caused a rift between her and her former husband, causing her to have less contact with Marja and her siblings. Marja’s sister Ellen: “My father made sure \[Kristel\] would not see her children anymore. Soon enough, he found love in my new mother, but Marja saw her as an intruder of sorts”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stepmother Gemma talks about the first time she met little Marja: “The first time I met Marja, she looked a bit scared. She cared a lot about making the atmosphere, but she had to do it her way”. Eventually, Marja’s dad lost his job, and Marja, who looked for a lot of love and attention, started to struggle. Ellen: “She always tried so hard to be seen in a positive light. Studying, buying gifts, practicing her talents. But she never quite achieved what she wanted.”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Marja is sweet, caring and talented, but another side of her develops as she grows up. She feels things other people don’t, and that makes her angry, lonely and scared. Ellen: “Eventually, you could see that Marja no longer knew what was and wasn’t normal in terms of interacting with other people. For example, she called 100 times a day, and when we blocked the phone, she’d just keep showing up at the door”. She became manic-depressive and fearful and developed schizophrenia. According to her biological mother, Marja wasn’t the first in the family to have psychiatric issues. Marja would wind up being admitted to a psychiatric ward multiple times. The behaviour she would later display in her final hours, could very well fit her psychiatric issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the years went on, Marja spent less time with her family, but more time with her partner, Steef. “We met in Tilburg when I was 26 and Marja was 20. At the time, I rode a motorbike, we met each other through a motorcycle club. Marja ended up getting into an art academy, which is how we ended up \[in Enschede\]. We both needed a lot of space, so we decided to each get our own place, in the same neighborhood”. Steef talks about how he and Marja would usually spend the final days of the year: “Usually, I had friends coming over to celebrate the end of the year with pyrotechnics. That’s a bit too loud and too busy for Marja. The past few years, she had spent New Year’s Eve with her family, and that’s what she was going to do \[in 2012\] as well”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Marja used to be on benefits, and according to Steef, could have trouble managing her money. He talks about a nice man from Marja’s church, who would help her out, with money or advice. However, like with many other people, Marja could easily get mad at this man, despite having good intentions. Sometimes she even paints him as the devil. Bureau Dupin found this man, named Hennie. He says: “I gave her the love she sought for. No, I wasn’t her dad, or her lover, just someone who wanted to help.” He even makes sure she can take a holiday to France. “But usually, she came back with problems. She couldn’t adjust”. However, as said, Marja doesn’t always appreciate him, and sometimes sends angry letters or e-mails. Despite this, Hennie does not hold it against her: “This was not feigned. In spirit, she truly was a good woman.”

&amp;#x200B;

Religion and spirituality also played a big part in Marja’s life. According to Steef, she was always on a quest to find what fit her, which involved quite some changes in religion and beliefs. Eventually, she ended up at a Pentecostal Church. “I didn’t fully approve, but I supported her”. This church and its members seem to have played a big part in Marja’s final months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marja’s last days: what do we know and why did she end up in Oss?** 

***A map of the locations mentioned in this section can be found here:***  [https://imgur.com/TSvDZtH](https://imgur.com/TSvDZtH)

The brief history leading directly to Marja’s death starts in the morning of December 29th, 2012. It is this morning that she decides to leave behind her hometown Enschede and crosses the border to stay in a hotel in the German town of Gronau. While this might seem like quite a move, it should be noted that both Enschede and Gronau are very close to the border, mere kilometers apart – both cities are within biking distance of one another. She stays in the hotel for two nights. The owner would eventually tell Bureau Dupin that Marja did not seem to make a panicked impression at first, he noticed “not everything was right” as her stay went on. He says Marja had said she fled, and mentioned “God, and priests, and the devil – I don’t quite know”. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the morning of December 31st of 2012, an unknown man calls the hotel Marja is staying at, and asks for her. The owner of the hotel tells the caller that he can’t share this information, however, he does inform Marja of this phone call. She panics, and leaves the hotel right away. Around 11AM that morning, she is seen back at the train station of Enschede, along with her bike, a grey suitcase, a backpack and a little purse. Instead of going back home, however, she buys a one-way ticket to the city of Oss. 

&amp;#x200B;

But why would she end up in Oss, of all places? Obviously, for people not from the Netherlands, city names barely mean anything. People know of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, if at all. It might be good to know a bit more about Oss and other cities in the Netherlands. For example, Oss is not at all a big or prominent city. The “big four” cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague (Den Haag) and Utrecht. However, none of them are in the same province as Oss. But even in that province – North Brabant – there are other, bigger cities such as Eindhoven, Breda, Den Bosch and even Tilburg, where Marja and her partner had met. In addition to this, the train ride from Enschede to Oss takes about two hours and involves at least one change of trains. If Marja was trying to outright flee the country, would she take this route, only to end up in the not-very-significant city of Oss? 

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the podcasts produced by Bureau Dupin, Marja’s partner at the time of her disappearance suggested a possible reason to visit Oss: according to him, Marja would visit her father for New Year’s Eve, who lives in the town of Udenhout, which is about half an hour away from Oss. However, this does not explain why she would visit the hotel in Gronau first. Other information from Bureau Dupin’s investigation seems to contradict this: they claim that on December 30th, while staying in Gronau, Marja sent a text to her church:

&amp;#x200B;

*“I have become a refugee. I can’t stay in Europe any longer. Warn Rob, he prays for me”*

&amp;#x200B;

This gives no indication that Marja ever intended to spend the last day of 2012 with her father, and did not tell her partner what she was going to do. And Bureau Dupin has even more interesting tidbits to share. According to their investigation into telecom data, the man that called the Gronau hotel to ask for Marja had called the hotel with a phone number that belonged to Marja Nijholt herself. But then who actually called? The only thing the hotel owner can say is that the caller sounded like a man. More on that later. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Marja’s final days, especially during her time in Oss which we will talk about shortly, she made a stressed and fearful impression on those who saw her. She thought she was being followed or even stalked, and whether that’s true or not, it was the reality she lived in. Her partner Steef comments: “Wherever we went, someone was there to watch her. She also said someone was watching *me*, but I never quite found any reason to believe as much. Usually, she couldn’t tell me who was following her, though”. 

&amp;#x200B;

In an interview with Bureau Dupin, Marja’s “good Samaritan” Hennie mentions someone who hadn’t been part of the investigation before: the leader of the Pentecostal Church that Marja had become a part of. Hennie: “He lived in Oss. Marja went there to get help and talk to him. I don’t understand why they didn’t help her out”. Steef supports the theory: “The leader did indeed live in Oss. Marja told me she would visit her father, but it seems that wasn’t her true plan”. Bureau Dupin spoke to some other members of the Pentecostal Church, who say they were informed of Marja’s plans to leave for Oss, and maybe even sleep in the forest. Instead, they convinced her to not do that, and instead she went to Gronau. A man and a woman both mention they had received calls and messages from Marja on December 31st, but they don’t want to mention the names she had mentioned. In the end, they decide to share this information with Bureau Dupin, as long as it is kept secret from the general public. They also reveal they are the recipients of the text message Marja sent on December 30th, as mentioned above. One of them reveals: “Halfway through December 2012, Marja asked me to ask X to call her, and pray for her father. She said God had other intentions for her father”. He refuses to share X’s name, out of privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

A clearer timeline develops. While she didn’t go to her father as she had told Steef, Marja seems to have left Enschede for Gronau on December 29th to escape the chaos of New Years Eve. A day later, she texts her fellow church member to warn X of her situation. Eventually, Bureau Dupin finds out X is named Rob who was mentioned earlier in Marja's text. Could he be the reason Marja travelled to Oss? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Marja’s day in Oss: a timeline**

As we now know, Marja leaves the hotel in Gronau in the morning of December 31st and heads straight from Enschede to Oss. While the exact reason is a secret Marja has taken to her grave, we now know she might’ve chosen Oss in particular to try and meet Rob. Fact is that she ends up at the Oss train station around 2PM on that final day of the year. Below is a timeline of Marja’s final day, based off of the “official” timeline as it was shown in Opsporing Verzocht, a Dutch television show which every week showcases police cases, hoping to engage the audience in finding the culprits. Additional information came from Bureau Dupin’s podcast.

&amp;#x200B;

**2PM**: Marja arrives at the station in Oss. 

**4PM**: Marja arrives at café Libre in the Molenstraat in Oss. Despite this only being a 4 minute walk from the station, Marja takes about two hours. In the meantime, various witnesses report Marja approaching them, asking to use their phones – she says she can’t use her own as she was being spied on – as well as asking for cheap places to spend the night. It later turns out that at least one of these calls was made to Rob. In Café Libre she continues, and mentions she wants to travel to Belgium, as it would be cheaper to stay there. 

**6PM**: Marja leaves the café Libre and does as she did before: she approaches people asking for a place to stay and to use their phone. Pouring rain starts, and continues throughout the night.

**8.30PM**: Marja arrives at cafetaria Oostwal where the owner allows her to make a phone call. He describes her as confused (a Dutch euphemism for “out of her mind”, really) and slightly panicked. Efforts in 2021 to track the number she called, fall flat, as the data is kept for only 7 years. 

**9PM**: Marja leaves cafetaria Oostwal with her bicycle. There is a probable sighting of her at the station of Oss just after 9PM. As it was New Year’s Eve and trains don’t run after 8PM that night, it’s plausible Marja stayed at the station for a bit – as it would be calm. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this Marja isn’t seen until hours later, well into 2013. Her bicycle is never seen after she left cafetaria Oostwal with it. Rob, the man Marja might have been looking for, does recall being called by Marja on December 31st: “Yes, I got a call from someone telling me, hey, I have someone named Marie here who’s asking for you. But I refused to take the call or elaborate. It just didn’t feel right”. He says he did not get a call around the time Marja attempted to call from cafetaria Oostwal.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.45AM, January 1st, 2013:** Marja is seen walking on a big road, the Graafsebaan, in the pouring rain and against traffic. She is walking in the direction of the Berghemseweg, which is where her body would eventually be found. As said, her bicycle has disappeared, but she still carries her suitcase and backpack. 

**3.10AM**: A petrol pump’s CCTV (on the Singel 1940-1945) catches Marja walking. She has continued from the Berghemseweg onto the Osseweg, which leads out of Oss into the neighbouring town of Berghem (confusing, I know). 

**4.30AM to 6.15AM**: Marja is seen multiple times in the town of Berghem. She is tired and now asks people how to get to the train station. The nearest train station however is the station back in Oss, where she arrived the previous day. It means she has to turn around and follow the Osseweg again, this time back to Oss. 

**6.30AM**: This marks the final time Marja is caught on camera, walking on the Osseweg.

**6.55AM**: Marja’s last sighting by a witness, still on the Osseweg. 

**Just after 7AM**: A local man and woman find an opened suitcase in a park near the Berghemseweg. Later, it turns out this is Marja’s suitcase.

**10.30AM**: A passerby finds Marja’s corpse next to a car parked by a house on the Berghemseweg. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Developments after Marja’s death – the suitcase, the pictures, the phone calls**

The investigation starts. While it goes on for about 18 months, the trail seems to die out in 2014, and the case becomes one of many cold cases, until Bureau Dupin started its investigations. Even identifying the victim already proves a challenge, as it takes multiple days until Marja’s family can identify her. The **crime scene**, of course, also poses multiple questions. Multiple scenarios, including an accident and (attempted) suicide, are investigated. The crime scene is relatively free of blood, despite multiple stab wounds on Marja’s body. While Marja’s partner Steef suggests she might have been killed elsewhere only to be disposed of by the Berghemseweg, it should also be noted that due to the heavy rain, blood might have been washed away. The same is said about the murder weapon: it could be any sharp object, even an object without traces of blood, as they might have been washed away. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after Marja’s death, the aforementioned TV show Opsporing Verzocht shows a timeline of Marja’s final days, and asks for a few specific people, possible **witnesses**, to be identified. They mention a person wearing an Angerfist (i.e. Jason Voorhees) mask, seen on the Berghemseweg around 4.30AM. They also mention a man and a woman in a car, seen (probably) fighting around the crossing of the Berghemseweg and the Goudplevier at 6.30AM. Finally, they ask for a man seen at the station of Oss around 8.15AM: the man, taking a train headed towards the city of Nijmegen, appeared wounded and might be a victim of violence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another point of discussion is Marja’s **suitcase**. It was found just after 7AM in a park near the Berghemseweg, opened, with items scattered around. The witnesses described it as if “it had been thrown around”. Despite the heavy rainfall of that night, the items were barely wet, which could indicate the suitcase hadn’t been there and opened for a long while, as the rain had mostly ceased by this time. One of the witnesses, Lia, also walked by the spot Marja would eventually be found – however, she didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. While it could just mean she did not see Marja’s body, it begs the question whether or not Marja’s body was already in its place at this point in time, just after 7AM. 

&amp;#x200B;

During Bureau Dupin’s investigation, the police released a few **pictures** taken at the crime scene as Marja was found. An interesting find was a laptop, which means that a robbery might not be as likely. Some of the Dupin investigators theorized that Marja’s position was not “natural”, ie that her body could have very well been put in its place instead of ending up there without being moved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Bureau Dupin investigated a few tens of thousands **phone calls**. Since they are not actual police officers, law enforcement had to “pseudo-anonymize” all the data, giving each phone a number on its own. Soon enough, multiple phones were marked as interesting or atypical. Two phones were marked as belonging to Marja, while a witness from her church claimed that she had at least 4. While the police could not verify whether those phones belonged to Marja or not, they did call it a “very reasonable assumption”. 

&amp;#x200B;

The goal, of course, was to get an insight into the infamous phone call that caused Marja to leave the hotel in Gronau. While the police again could not verify, the Bureau Dupin team found reason to think that a phone labeled “9104” belonged to the hotel in Gronau. Three phone calls were made to this hotel in Marja’s final days. The first of these came from a phone labeled “147” in the southeast part of Amsterdam, a call made on the morning of December 29th. Another call lasting only 10 seconds was made on December 30th, coming from phone “11028”, located in the town of Losser, near Gronau in the Netherlands. The final call was made from phone “5735” just before 1PM on December 31st. 

&amp;#x200B;

The final phone call was quickly dismissed, as Marja had already checked out of her hotel at that time, and was on her way to Oss. The first phone call made by phone 147 became a point of interest, especially as the phone had no single other appearance in the web of telecom data that was investigated. However, the phone call was made at 8.35AM on the 29th of December. Not only was this two days before Marja actually left – Marja hadn’t even checked into the hotel that early on the 29th! That only leaves the call made on the 30th, coming from phone 11028. This call, too, was not made on the 31st (i.e. the day Marja got scared and left her hotel). Another interesting detail is, that… phone 11028 was said to belong to **Marja Nijholt herself!** 

&amp;#x200B;

So why did Marja’s phone make a call to the hotel on the 30th, during her stay there? And what happened to the phone call on the morning of the 31st that supposedly scared Marja away, as this is nowhere to be found in the Dupin investigation? The phone call perhaps remains the biggest mystery in this case. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other curiosities**

As the Bureau Dupin podcast released its episodes, a listener called in with a very interesting perspective. He referenced a Dutch crime thriller book, released in 2011, with eerie similarities to Marja’s case. For example, the main character was described as creative, a piano player, and had a familiar history of schizophrenia – all of which apply to Marja. Another character lived in fear of being murdered. The story is also set in the same area that Marja lived in, around Enschede. Now this is where it gets real weird: one of the chapters of the books shows the character escaping to Germany, more specifically Gronau, where she stays in the EXACT SAME HOTEL Marja would end up staying at, mere days before her death. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions by the police, by Bureau Dupin and by us**

The questions the official police “cold case” webpage asks are as follows; 

\- Who has been a witness of the murder of Marja Nijholt on January 1st, 2013 between 6.55AM and 10.20AM?

\- Who knows where Marja was between December 31st 9PM and January 1st, 3AM?

\- Who has seen Marja at any other times this night?

\- Who knows where Marja was between 6.55AM and 10.20AM on January 1st, 2013?

\- Who knows what happened in the little park adjacent to the Berghemseweg between these times?

\- Who has seen Marja on the Berghemseweg, possibly in the company of other people?

\- Who has found the item used to kill Marja? (NOTE: due to heavy rain, it could be free of blood stains)

\- Who knows where Marja’s bicycle is?

\- Who has information about this case that they haven’t shared with law enforcement yet?

Other things to think about include:

\- Who was behind the call that scared Marja away from her hotel? Do we know the full truth about this call?

\- Was Marja’s fear for her life grounded, and was she chased? Or was this merely a product of her psychiatric issues, and was she a victim of circumstance?

\- Where did Marja spend the hours between 9AM and 2.45AM the night of her death? She might have stayed at the station, but she might have also found a roof to stay under for a few hours. In either case, why did she re-appear in the middle of the night? 

Hope you are as captivated by this case as I am. Wonder what you all think. This was quite a bit of work, but very interesting, so if the interest is there, perhaps I’ll look into more Dutch cold cases.

Noreen Anne Greenley (b. May 16, 1950)

Disappeared on September 14, 1963, aged 13.

The evening of her disappearance, Noreen Greenley was bowling at the Liberty Bowl on Baseline Rd, Bowmanville, with her friend, Bonnie Wilkins, and Bonnie’s boyfriend, Gary Woolner. After bowling, they went to Sam’s Restaurant (14 Division St.) and then on to Bonnie’s house at the corner of Waverly Rd and King St./Hwy 2 (now “Old” King St, since Hwy 2 was later re-routed further north). Bonnie reported to police and the newspapers that she and Gary wanted to spend time alone, so Noreen left to catch the 11:30 PM westbound bus for home at the stop across the street (again, at the corner of Waverly &amp; King St/Hwy 2). After waiting a short time, Noreen returned to the Wilkins house, spoke more with Bonnie before leaving again to catch the bus.

She did not catch the bus and was not seen again after leaving the Wilkins house the second time.

A Ford Prefect or Renault automobile was reported by a neighbour in the vicinity of the bus stop around the same time, occupied by a man in a fedora. Noreen’s sister, Joyce, encountered the same vehicle around the same time that night on Holt Rd, near the Greenley family home, speeding by her and a friend. The two reported hearing a scream from the car, suspected to have been Noreen. Noreen’s father and brother attempted to follow the car, but could not locate it, unaware Noreen may have been inside.

A massive search took place in the days following Noreen’s disappearance, which turned up no trace of her.  
The Greenley family has never lost hope that they would one day learn the truth about what happened to Noreen. Durham Regional Police continues to list the case file as open.

Trevor Deely was last seen on CCTV footage. GARDA released the footage in 2017 (17 years later) after it was enhanced. But the footage is incomplete with missing parts that can contain important details. 

The release of full footage by GARDA is very important in solving this case. 

It\`s horrible for his family not knowing what happened for such a long time.

Maybe you think Trevor disappeared a long time ago, but remember what Trevor\`s family said: *'The easiest attitude is to say he's gone... but he deserves more than that'*

I have only done a handful of write-ups, but I like to keep tabs on interesting missing persons around me and I keep seeing Kirsten's name on social media but I haven't seen it pop up on Reddit yet. I wanted to share it because yesterday marked a year since she went missing from Indianapolis.

**Date, Time, &amp; Location:** January 2, 2021 12-2am. Shortridge Rd. in Indianapolis.

Kirsten Bruggeman, daughter of Rex and Lisa Bruggeman, went out with her friends to The Irish Mutt on the evening of January 1, 2021. Her mother typically picked her up from work, but that day she had called her mom to say she was going out with friends after work and would not need a ride. She then had no contact with her parents from that point forward. The next time her mom would try to reach her was around 12:30am and her phone had been shut off, and the call was forwarded to voicemail.

Kirsten is described as a fun person who had a heart for animals. Her father said in an interview that she would do just about anything to help dogs, cats, or any other animal. A caucasian, 26-year old, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was 5' 2"" and weighed 115lbs. She was last seen in a black coat, blue jeans, a gray stocking cap, with a white backpack.

That night she was at a locally owned pub and eatery with her friends on 10th street in Indianapolis, at 12:15am she told them she wanted to go bowling and left the pub in the direction of the bowling alley. At 2am she is caught on video footage of the YMCA on Shortridge Rd, Indianapolis. The YMCA is on the way to the only 24-hour bowling alley in the greater Indianapolis area, but this YMCA is only an 8 minute walk from the bar so there is roughly an hour and a half of unaccounted time in the timeline. The Beech Grove bowling alley is a 2 hour walk from the pub. When passing the YMCA she was heading in the direction of the bowling alley. \*\*She left the bar on foot, was caught on the footage 2 hours later on foot,we know her mother picks her up from work, and we know her phone was off at 12:30 when her mother tried to call her. Based on this, I have assumed she walked and did not call an Uber or other form of driver.

That video footage is the last time that Kirsten was seen. Her parents have been diligent at doing everything to find her. They have done several interviews, in March they hired a private investigation firm called Lauth Investigations International, a GoFundMe, a facebook page with #FindKirsten (due to reddit's rule I cannot link to their facebook page, but you can find it through the #), and their most recent action was to hold a vigil on September 18, 2021 at the intersection of 10th St. and Shortridge Rd. 40 people showed up to this vigil where they handed out missing flyers for individuals to hand out or hang up in the area and honored the memory of Kristen.

No updates have been released by law enforcement or the private investigators, and the PI has released that nothing has been found by them or LE during searches of the area. The family has announced a $10,000 reward for tips or information that leads to the safe return of Kirsten.

**Interesting note:** I have not found anywhere where the video footage or even a still of the footage has been released. I think this would be a way to jog people's memory of seeing her that evening, but I'm not an investigator so there is probably a reason that has not been released.

**Discrepancies:** Some reports are 12:20am and others are 2am for the time that Kirsten was last seen on video footage. I believe this is because her friends last saw her at 12:15am, while she was seen on the video footage at 2:00am. It seems some reports got these two times confused.

What an incredible effort!


Article: 
Tennessee law enforcement has recovered 150 missing children after a months-long investigation.

The children, between three and 17-years old, were found in three ""two-week blitzes"" throughout the US state.
Five of the children were suspected to be victims of human trafficking, investigators said, and one was rescued as part of a kidnapping probe.
The recoveries are among the largest for recent missions by states to find missing children.

A number of arrests have been made following the probe, officials said.
""I hope this operation changes the course for 150 young lives and leads them to the path of opportunities every child deserves,"" said US Marshal for the Western District of Tennes
The operation, dubbed Volunteer Strong, was launched in the fall of 2020. A total of 240 missing children were identified statewide, inciting the joint effort by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), US Marshals Services and Tennessee Department of Children's Services. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also provided support.
Recovery efforts began in January and 150 children were found within two months.

The circumstances of the recovered children varied widely, authorities said, including children that left home, those living with other family members, and others facing abuse or exploitation.
Tim Burchett, a Tennessee congressman, called the results ""miraculous"".

In all of 2020, a total of 387 children were recovered with assistance from US Marshals. Several other states including Ohio, Virginia, Indiana and Georgia have also launched operations to focus on finding missing children.
Efforts to find the remaining 90 missing children in Tennessee will continue, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said.

The curious case of Erica Franolich has haunted an Upstate NY community for 35 years. While it may seem that she was murdered by her husband, there's still no firm proof.

Excerpt:

 

*There is no doubt, he added, who is responsible for his sister's disappearance.*

*Despite the years and the death of some of her relatives and people who may have information about her disappearance, Mr. Poprafsky believes a resolution is near and it will be solved soon, he said last year.*

*Mr. Popfrasky noted that Ms. Franolich was staying with her husband's family on Westfall Road in Delanson at the time of her disappearance. Members of the family still live in the red and white, two-story farmhouse on the property, which borders Cross Road.*

*When his sister spoke to him that night, Ms. Franolich did not mention that she was in Middleburgh. He did not know she was in Middleburgh until the next month when he received his phone bill.*

*Her husband Richard was working for Mr. Poprafsky when they lived in Michigan.*

*Mr. Poprafsky, 71, told several stories of Mr. Franolich allegedly harming his wife, including one time when Mr. Franolich allegedly ""dragged her in the street with his car when they lived here.""*

*Mr. Overacker has been investigating the details of the disappearance for several years and was in Middleburgh a few times last year interviewing people about the night Ms. Franolich went missing.*

*The answer is out there, he said.*

*""Some of the family members could put an end to this today and it's absolutely unconscionable for them to remain silent. How they sleep at night is beyond us,"" he said last year.*

*Mr. Overacker has spoken to many people involved in the case, including Ms. Franolich's husband Richard.*

*There are inconsistencies in his story about what happened to Ms. Franolich after October 13, 1986, according to Mr. Overacker.*

*At first, Mr. Franolich said he put his wife on a bus in Schenectady two or three days before Halloween, 1986, Mr. Overacker said. He did not know where she was going but had $280 on her. Then he said he put her on the bus two or three days after October 13. Then he said he put her on a bus on October 14. Mr. Franolich said he was with his wife after October 13, 1986, according to Mr. Overacker. In the four to six weeks prior to her disappearance, the Franolichs lived in several different places including his grandparents, parents, and brother's. They also stayed at the Franolich's property on Westfall and Cross Roads in Delanson.*

*The interviews with Mr. Franolich have been frustrating, Mr. Overacker said.*

185,MaddiKate,[],1641146651,"Happy New Year! I am back with another cold case from the Gem State. With the new year, I am going to take a unique approach this time around- I am going to cover three cases in one post. Partially because there is not much info known about these cases, and partially because there is a possibility that they are connected. 

To start with, I will give a summary of each child's life and the events of their disappearance. Then I will list out theories.

**Curtis Mackeever ""Mack"" Fair** [DOB: 09/02/1978] was a two-year-old boy living with his parents and baby sister in Nampa, ID- a city about 20 miles west of Boise. On November 5, 1980, Mack was last seen playing in his neighbor's yard on the 300 block of 15th Ave North. No timeline has been provided, but reportedly, he vanished from the yard and was never seen again. I am not sure what Nampa looked like in 1980. But in 2022, this area is in one of the rougher parts of town- the area is in a ""food desert"", most of the houses are worn down, and it is hot for gang activity. Indian Creek, which flows through Canyon County and joins to the Snake River, flows by this neighbor's yard. It was suspected that Mack may have drowned in the river. However, his remains have never turned up. His father passed away in 2008, and his mother is still searching for him- though she is reportedly in poor health. 

**Richard ""Ricky"" Ray Barnett** [DOB: 11/26/1979] was a two-year-old boy living in rural Grangeville, ID. Ricky lived primarily with his parents- though I cannot tell if they were together at the time of his disappearance. Ricky was visiting his paternal grandparents, Waldo and Martha McChoard, for two weeks on their property at Hillcrest Farms- which was made up of several hundred acres. On the morning of August 31, 1982, Ricky was last seen playing on a hay wagon while several workers helped deliver chickens to the farm. At some point during this transaction, Ricky went missing. A search party was organized within 15 minutes, and he was called in as a missing person by 10:30 am. This search went on for about four days and included 250 volunteers. Bloodhound dogs tracked his scent to a fence line in the northwest area of the property before they lost his scent. Ricky's disappearance is a bit different from the other two in that there was some suspicion towards the family. Reportedly, Marth and Waldo did not like Ricky's mother for unknown reasons and had expressed wanting someone else to aise him. They have been subjected to multiple interviews and polygraphs over the years, but nothing came of these. I have seen multiple reports that there is suspicion that the McChoards sold Ricky into an underground adoption ring, but I am not sure where this comes from. Ricky's mother is still actively looking for him. His father, Ellis, passed away about a decade ago. At the time of his death, the found a picture of an unidentified young man posed next to a bear that he hunted. The man in the pictures looks like Ricky may look like as an adult, implying that Ellis died believing his son was still alive. This man has since been confirmed to be another man living in Alaska. 

**Jason Keith Cannon** [DOB: 05/07/1980] was a two-year-old boy living with his family in Boise, ID- the state's capitol. On March 16, 1983, Jason was last seeing playing on the front porch with his mother. Reportedly, his mother went inside for a few minutes to look for a jacket for him. When she returned, Jason was gone. He has never been seen since. 

It should be noted that all three of these boys are classified as non-family abductions by law enforcement, and the Idaho Missing Persons Clearinghouse classifies them as ""involuntary missing."" Perhaps law enforcement knows more than they are listing publically, but these are where the cases are at today.

So we have three little boys that were abducted in the same state within a three-year range, two who lived reasonably close to each other. There is very little information available about these cases. I do not know if family members have been ruled out or not- though we know that Mack and Ricky have living family members who are actively searching for them. I also do not know if any other toddlers went missing in that time period, but were rescued or found deceased. 

Off the bad, I am inclined to believe that Ricky's case is unrelated. He lived several hundred miles from the other two boys, and there are several persons of interest in the case- namely his grandparents and possibly one of the workers who were delivering chickens that day. It is also possible that Ricky wandered off- though Idaho County is VAST and I doubt that Ricky would travel far on foot without being found. 

Whereas I do think Mack and Jason's disappearances could be related since they went missing under similar circumstances within the same region. I'm not married to this theory, but the likelihood is stronger than with the others. 

What do you think happened to these boys? Abduction? Death by adventure? Murder? Are they connected, or do you think they are unrelated?

A mysterious Neurological illness has been affecting people in Canada's New Brunswick province and has been leaving scientists and doctors baffled for over two years.

Patients are developing a number of symptoms ranging from rapid weight loss, insomnia, and hallucinations to difficulty thinking and limited mobility.

According to the article:

* One suspected case involved a man who was developing symptoms of dementia and ataxia. His wife, who was his caregiver, suddenly began losing sleep and experiencing muscle wasting, dementia and hallucinations. Now her condition is worse than his.
* A woman in her 30s was described as non-verbal, is feeding with a tube and drools excessively. Her caregiver, a nursing student in her 20s, also recently started showing symptoms of neurological decline.
* In another case, a young mother quickly lost nearly 60 pounds, developed insomnia and began hallucinating. Brain imaging showed advanced signs of atrophy.

Scientists believe this disease may have been caused by some environmental factor, and not purely localised to New Brunswick. However, the source of the disease is still unresolved.",Mysterious New Brunswick Disease

Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. 

THE DISAPPEARENCE


On August 31, 2015, Macin sent a photo of his grades from school saying they were okay and that he could watch anime as seen in the transcript below:

“This good enough grades to watch Anime.”

His mom wrote back: 

“Wow! Looking good Macin. Have dad take you driving first.”


Macin Smith

Macin Smith was born on April 7, 1998. He was the youngest of six kids, and his family was originally from Canada. Macin moved with his parents Tracey and Darrin to St. George, Utah, shortly before he disappeared. 
Macin was described as very bright, but liked to spend time alone. He preferred playing video games or watching Anime, over hanging out with friends. Macin also had a history of depression, and his family thought that things were improving once they moved to Utah. 


Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. Macin was in summer school, because his credits from Canada didn’t transfer over. 
His family said Macin seemed happier in Utah. He had a speech impediment, and had gotten bullied when he was younger. Macin was also working with his dad on finally getting his driver’s license, but he didn’t think he was good enough to get it. Macin told his parents he wasn’t feeling well that night, and they left him alone. Tracey also said that she unplugged the internet, because Macin liked to watch Anime into the early morning hours. 
Around 1:30am, Darrin woke up and went to check on Macin. He found him watching Anime. He had plugged the internet back in, and Darrin ended up taking his computer and phone away. 
Darrin would later say that he and Macin didn’t get into a fight that night, and Macin just handed over his electronics, and seemed okay with it. 


￼

Macin’s parents, Tracey and Darrin

The Disappearance 
On Tuesday, September 1, Darrin woke Macin up around 7am for school. Tracey said she remembers Macin getting up right away, walking around and leaving around 7:40am. 
Macin still took the bus, and his bus stop was about 2 miles from his home. Tracey went to work that day, and Darrin stayed home to do yard work. Around 3:15pm, Macin’s bus had pulled up and started dropping kids off. By 3:30pm, Macin still didn’t return home. Darrin had no way of contacting him, because he had taken his phone the night before. 

Darrin texted Tracey that Macin never returned home. Tracey decided to check her email, and realized she received a message from the school that said Macin never showed up that day. Tracey was stunned and left work early. 
Tracey and Darrin also decided to go through Macin’s room, and they didn’t find anything. They also called Macin’s church youth group, and discovered he hadn’t been there. By 10pm, they called the St. George police, to report Macin missing. 
The Investigation
The police started their investigation right away, and Tracey started her own investigation. 
Tracey went to the high school to pay for Macin’s graduation cap and gown, and she realized Macin never showed up to school again. She also contacted the bus, and talked to several student that rode the bus. No one had seen Macin. 

Tracey and Darrin searched Macin’s room again, and they found his school binders on the floor of his closet. The episode described this as if Macin was hiding his school supplies, but nothing was ever found in his supplies. Macin’s wallet was also found in his room, with cash and ID cards in it. 
Tracey and Darrin called their other children and told them that their brother was missing. They all returned home to come and look for him. 
New Leads 
When Macin’s siblings returned, they all drove around putting up missing persons fliers of Macin. They also had the LDS church help with the search. 
Many tips came pouring in. One tip was about a male, matching Macin’s description, standing on the street with a sign that said need a ride to Vegas. This road was about 5 miles away from Macin’s home. 

The description of this person sounded like Macin. The road was surrounded by several gas stations, and the Smith’s contacted the stations about their surveillance footage. It turned out not to be Macin, it was another teenager. 
There was another tip that came in. This time, several people said they saw Macin in Las Vegas, which was about two hours from St. George. Darrin drove to Las Vegas to search, along with a search group called the Red Rock Search and Rescue. There was again no sign of Macin. 
The Note 
Tracey was the main talking head in this episode, and she said about a week passed with no sign or contact with Macin. Macin’s aunt was able to get the passwords for his computer, phone and social media. They discovered that Macin really didn’t use social media or his phone. He had deleted his search history, but mainly used his computer to watch Anime and play video games. 
They did find something else, though. In Macin’s wallet, they found a note. It was a two page note, that had been folded multiple times. It wasn’t addressed to anyone or dated, but it was a very “deep” note. The Smith’s have not released much information about it. All they said was that Macin had written “I’m done.” 

The police believed that Macin didn’t want anyone to find that note, and if he did want it found, he would’ve put it in an obvious place. 
Tracey said that Macin had told her he tried to commit suicide before, but she didn’t believe he wanted to hurt himself again. They didn’t own any gun, or have any pills. She said anything was possible, but she just didn’t believe it. 
Another Search
Three weeks later, the Red Rock Search and Rescue came to help the Smith’s. They came out to St. George for two days. They brought equestrians and six cadaver dogs from California. It was the largest wilderness search to date, and there were still no signs of Macin Smith. 
A Macin Smith Facebook page was created, and this led to many rumors about Macin, his family and what happened to him. 
There were rumors that Macin was gay, and disappeared because he didn’t want to tell his family. Tracey said she didn’t believe that he was gay, and even if he was it didn’t matter to them. 

Five months after Macin disappeared, allegations against Darrin Smith came out. They said that Darrin had killed his son. Darrin denied it, and said the police could do anything to prove that he didn’t. He and Tracey both took polygraph tests, and Tracey said they both passed. However, the St. George police declined to comment. To me this sounds like one of them didn’t pass, but maybe they just can’t comment since it’s an open investigation. 
Tracey also believed that Macin would return or get into contact with someone once he turned 18. They hosted an event on his 18th birthday, and Macin didn’t return or reach out to anyone. 
Another Dead End 
In July 2016, a tip came in from two girls said they saw Macin at a Panda Express in West Valley. They said this boy approached them, and asked them for some change for the bus. They noticed he was very polite, and that he had a speech impediment. 
When Tracey heard about this, she had the girls call Macin’s phone to hear his voicemail. The girls said that this was the voice of the person they talked to. 
The police contacted the Panda Express for their surveillance footage, but of course, it wasn’t working. 

Where is Macin?
Tracey believes Macin is out there somewhere. She even kept paying his phone bill for awhile because it was the only number he knew. She stopped paying for it eventually. 
Darrin thinks his son is gone. 
There is a $10,000 reward out there for any information about where Macin could be. 
The theories about what happened include: suicide and foul play. 

Maybe one day, there will be answers about Macin Smith. If you have any information, you can contact the St. George police at 435-627-4300. 

As late as 2017, the police have said that there have been changes in Tracey and Darrin’s stories. They have told the police, the Red Rock group and the media different things. 
In 2018, Tracey and Darrin Smith divorced, and they are both remarried.

Tracey said that Macin had told her he tried to commit suicide before, but she didn’t believe he wanted to hurt himself again. They didn’t own any gun, or have any pills. She said anything was possible, but she just didn’t believe it. 
Another Search
Three weeks later, the Red Rock Search and Rescue came to help the Smith’s. They came out to St. George for two days. They brought equestrians and six cadaver dogs from California. It was the largest wilderness search to date, and there were still no signs of Macin Smith. 
A Macin Smith Facebook page was created, and this led to many rumors about Macin, his family and what happened to him. 
There were rumors that Macin was gay, and disappeared because he didn’t want to tell his family. Tracey said she didn’t believe that he was gay, and even if he was it didn’t matter to them. 

Five months after Macin disappeared, allegations against Darrin Smith came out. They said that Darrin had killed his son. Darrin denied it, and said the police could do anything to prove that he didn’t. He and Tracey both took polygraph tests, and Tracey said they both passed. However, the St. George police declined to comment. To me this sounds like one of them didn’t pass, but maybe they just can’t comment since it’s an open investigation. 
Tracey also believed that Macin would return or get into contact with someone once he turned 18. They hosted an event on his 18th birthday, and Macin didn’t return or reach out to anyone. 
Another Dead End 
In July 2016, a tip came in from two girls said they saw Macin at a Panda Express in West Valley. They said this boy approached them, and asked them for some change for the bus. They noticed he was very polite, and that he had a speech impediment. 
When Tracey heard about this, she had the girls call Macin’s phone to hear his voicemail. The girls said that this was the voice of the person they talked to. 
The police contacted the Panda Express for their surveillance footage, but of course, it wasn’t working. 

Where is Macin?
Tracey believes Macin is out there somewhere. She even kept paying his phone bill for awhile because it was the only number he knew. She stopped paying for it eventually. 
Darrin thinks his son is gone. 
There is a $10,000 reward out there for any information about where Macin could be. 
The theories about what happened include: suicide and foul play. 

Maybe one day, there will be answers about Macin Smith. If you have any information, you can contact the St. George police at 435-627-4300. 

As late as 2017, the police have said that there have been changes in Tracey and Darrin’s stories. They have told the police, the Red Rock group and the media different things. 
In 2018, Tracey and Darrin Smith divorced, and they are both remarried.

he had a speech impediment that caused him to suffer some degree of bullying at school, he was also described as introverted and calm, he had a few peers to talk to but no ""true friendships"" outside of the school environment.

he tried to commit suicide at least once, in addition to trying to run away from home, having once run away while still living in Canada, having given up and coming home due to the cold weather that was the night of the escape.

Wors from his uncle: 

""Macin suffered from depression, he had tried to commit suicide when he was 15, and was hospitalized, during this time. Macin felt he was different, and felt he did not fit in. I have read the note he left, and it is heartbreaking. I have always felt Macin committed suicide, but I have always wanted answers, and if that is what happened, a proper resting place for him, and the peace of knowing.""

Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. 

THE DISAPPEARENCE


On August 31, 2015, Macin sent a photo of his grades from school saying they were okay and that he could watch anime as seen in the transcript below:

“This good enough grades to watch Anime.”

His mom wrote back: 

“Wow! Looking good Macin. Have dad take you driving first.”


Macin Smith

Macin Smith was born on April 7, 1998. He was the youngest of six kids, and his family was originally from Canada. Macin moved with his parents Tracey and Darrin to St. George, Utah, shortly before he disappeared. 
Macin was described as very bright, but liked to spend time alone. He preferred playing video games or watching Anime, over hanging out with friends. Macin also had a history of depression, and his family thought that things were improving once they moved to Utah. 
The Day Before 
On Monday, August 31, 2015, Macin texted his mom a picture of his report card. The attached message read:

“This good enough grades to watch Anime.”

His mom wrote back: 

“Wow! Looking good Macin. Have dad take you driving first.”

Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. Macin was in summer school, because his credits from Canada didn’t transfer over. 
His family said Macin seemed happier in Utah. He had a speech impediment, and had gotten bullied when he was younger. Macin was also working with his dad on finally getting his driver’s license, but he didn’t think he was good enough to get it. Macin told his parents he wasn’t feeling well that night, and they left him alone. Tracey also said that she unplugged the internet, because Macin liked to watch Anime into the early morning hours. 
Around 1:30am, Darrin woke up and went to check on Macin. He found him watching Anime. He had plugged the internet back in, and Darrin ended up taking his computer and phone away. 
Darrin would later say that he and Macin didn’t get into a fight that night, and Macin just handed over his electronics, and seemed okay with it.

Macin’s parents, Tracey and Darrin

The Disappearance 
On Tuesday, September 1, Darrin woke Macin up around 7am for school. Tracey said she remembers Macin getting up right away, walking around and leaving around 7:40am. 
Macin still took the bus, and his bus stop was about 2 miles from his home. Tracey went to work that day, and Darrin stayed home to do yard work. Around 3:15pm, Macin’s bus had pulled up and started dropping kids off. By 3:30pm, Macin still didn’t return home. Darrin had no way of contacting him, because he had taken his phone the night before. 

Darrin texted Tracey that Macin never returned home. Tracey decided to check her email, and realized she received a message from the school that said Macin never showed up that day. Tracey was stunned and left work early. 
Tracey and Darrin also decided to go through Macin’s room, and they didn’t find anything. They also called Macin’s church youth group, and discovered he hadn’t been there. By 10pm, they called the St. George police, to report Macin missing. 
The Investigation
The police started their investigation right away, and Tracey started her own investigation. 
Tracey went to the high school to pay for Macin’s graduation cap and gown, and she realized Macin never showed up to school again. She also contacted the bus, and talked to several student that rode the bus. No one had seen Macin. 

Tracey and Darrin searched Macin’s room again, and they found his school binders on the floor of his closet. The episode described this as if Macin was hiding his school supplies, but nothing was ever found in his supplies. Macin’s wallet was also found in his room, with cash and ID cards in it. 
Tracey and Darrin called their other children and told them that their brother was missing. They all returned home to come and look for him. 
New Leads 
When Macin’s siblings returned, they all drove around putting up missing persons fliers of Macin. They also had the LDS church help with the search. 
Many tips came pouring in. One tip was about a male, matching Macin’s description, standing on the street with a sign that said need a ride to Vegas. This road was about 5 miles away from Macin’s home. 

The description of this person sounded like Macin. The road was surrounded by several gas stations, and the Smith’s contacted the stations about their surveillance footage. It turned out not to be Macin, it was another teenager. 
There was another tip that came in. This time, several people said they saw Macin in Las Vegas, which was about two hours from St. George. Darrin drove to Las Vegas to search, along with a search group called the Red Rock Search and Rescue. There was again no sign of Macin. 
The Note 
Tracey was the main talking head in this episode, and she said about a week passed with no sign or contact with Macin. Macin’s aunt was able to get the passwords for his computer, phone and social media. They discovered that Macin really didn’t use social media or his phone. He had deleted his search history, but mainly used his computer to watch Anime and play video games. 
They did find something else, though. In Macin’s wallet, they found a note. It was a two page note, that had been folded multiple times. It wasn’t addressed to anyone or dated, but it was a very “deep” note. The Smith’s have not released much information about it. All they said was that Macin had written “I’m done.” 

The police believed that Macin didn’t want anyone to find that note, and if he did want it found, he would’ve put it in an obvious place. 
Tracey said that Macin had told her he tried to commit suicide before, but she didn’t believe he wanted to hurt himself again. They didn’t own any gun, or have any pills. She said anything was possible, but she just didn’t believe it.

190,JessNoff,[],1641105610,"Melissa Trotter, Melissa Witt, and Carol Reed were all murdered while wearing Mickey Mouse watches.

Carol Reed: went missing on Dec 7 1993 from Brownsville, TX. found on Dec 9 1993, murder by strangulation. Was wearing a mickey mouse watch.

Melissa Witt: went missing on Dec 1 1994 from Fort Smith AR, murdered by strangulation - body found on Jan 13 1994. Was wearing a mickey mouse watch.

Melissa Trotter: went missing on Dec. 8 1998 from Conroe, TX. murder by strangulation - body found Jan 2 1999. Was wearing a mickey mouse watch.

Although Larry Swearingen was already executed for the murder of Melissa Trotter, I believe Melissa Trotter and Melissa Witt's cases are linked, and potentially Reed's too.

I have discovered some potentially linked content online, created by a man who has ties to Texas and Arkansas. He has a 30-year background in forestry (ie, he's familiar with national forest land) but more importantly, he's passionate about making simulated snuff porn videos, in which, he has his models wear - you guessed it - MICKEY MOUSE WATCHES while they play dead.

He has produced multiple films where he has the model who is posing dead wear a mickey mouse watch. He has an extensive body of work. He claims to have filmed over a thousand fetish videos about strangulation, and I believe him! I can easily find about 450 when I search online. He stars as the male murderer/strangler in most of his films.

The majority of his fetish films follow a similar plot line. He abducts a woman, strangles her with pantyhose , and has sex with her dead body, sometimes leaving her in the woods when he is done with her.

His death fetish writing has a focus on strangling southern women who are college students.

Here are some excerpts from his writing that remind me of Trotter and Witt:

“ I am 100% killer. I love in so many different ways to take a beautiful woman or lovely young woman of age and push her to her limits during her struggle. I love to see the tongue fishing for air when I am strangling. My next favorite part is to take my time exploring the corpse. Smelling, touching, tasting and then some nice long sex with the still warm body. After I finish, I love to drag, carry or dispose of the body in an outdoor location in the woods or in a field with tall grass. Body disposal in tarp, plastic or burial, or stash in the woods behind a log so that the law is close behind. I love the element of danger and possible capture as the villain. They will never get me, if they do I will escape. “

“A young woman is found (dead) in the woods with one shoe and white socks”

(This aligns with Trotter's crime scene photo where she is wearing white socks and missing one shoe.)

“Her once pink tongue bulged over her bottom teeth, hiding the perfect row of white… showing the bluish cast of her lips, the red and purple streaks that surrounded her throat completed her transformation from the living to the dead….he made love to her cooling body…. He looked for a studio to rent at Westwood campus…he couldn’t wait. He knew how beautiful southern women were.”

191,JoeDW1969,[],1641099966,"Many of the facts of this case were updated on June 14, 2020 by WNYT on their cold case program which was posted on YouTube. Many previous know facts were incorrect based on first hand accounts by her sister Jennifer and investigator Matt Wilson with the Saratoga Springs police department.

**Updated version of disappearance:**

Tammie McCormick was a 13 year old girl who lived in the Geyser Crest area of Saratoga Springs and attended seventh grade at Saratoga Springs Junior High School, which was then on West Circular Street. On Monday, April 28, 1986, Tammie had one of her friends sneak in her house and hide in her closet to stay over night without her family’s knowledge. Their plan was to runaway to Jacksonville Florida together in the morning by hitchhiking after her family left for work and school. On the morning of Tuesday, April 29, Tammie and her sister Jennifer were the only ones in her family still home, and Tammie told her sister that she intended to skip school that day. Her sister asked her if she wanted her to skip with her, and she told her “no, just go ahead and go” and so Jennifer went to school. After Jennifer left, her friend who stayed over night hiding in the closet stated to investigators that Tammie left the house, leaving her there alone, and didn’t tell her why she left or where she was going. Her friend met up with another friend, and followed through on their plan to hitchhike to Jacksonville Florida.

On the morning of Tuesday, April 29, a motorist claims to have seen a girl hitchhiking that matched Tammie’s description, but she was not heading south (to Florida). He claims he picked her up and dropped her off at Route 9P near Saratoga Lake. This is the last time anyone sees her.

Tammie’s mother Nancy Hieber allowed Tammie and unusual amount of freedom for a 13 year old girl, and it wasn’t unusual for Tammie to not come home and stay the night at a friends house without notifying her family. For this reason, when Tammie didn’t come home on Tuesday April 29 and Wednesday April 30th, her mother assumed she was staying at a friends house and was not alarmed. On Thursday, May 1, after not hearing from her daughter for two days and learning she hadn't attended school in those days, Nancy filed a missing persons report with the Saratoga Springs Police Department.

**Suspect:**

In February 2011, NewsChannel 13 broke the news that police had reopened the cold case and were now treating the investigation as a homicide. They also had a person of interest in the case Arthur ""Mason"" Slaybaugh II. Mason was a 26 year old whom police learned Tammie and her friends use to hang out with. Mason had a small house on Brown’s Beach near Saratoga Lake where he was known to have underage girls over partying and drinking. His small house is near the location where Tammie was dropped off and last seen by the motorist who picked her up hitchhiking. Based on the accounts, investigators believe that Tammie was heading for Mason’s apartment house that morning. Saratoga Springs Police Assistant Chief John Catone said in 2011 that he had evidence McCormick went to Slaybaugh's apartment around the time of her disappearance. Mason had an adult girlfriend who coincidently moved to Jacksonville Florida the same day Tammie disappeared. CBS6 reported in 2011 that Tammie use to babysit for Mason’s girlfriend’s child. Mason, a former corrections officer at Mount McGregor Correctional facility in Wilton died of a heart attack in January 2001 at the age of 41.

**Search for Tammie’s remains**:

Mason Slaybaugh had a brother Kenneth Slaybaugh who owns land that sits along Route 30 in the town of North Hampton, Fulton County, about 30 miles from where Tammie disappeared. In early November, 2017, police had new leads surface that were vetted and presented to a city judge who signed off on a search warrant to search Kenneth Slaybaugh’s property. Neighbors say Mason and Kenneth use to bury all kinds of things in their backyard including car parts and boats at all hours of the night. Saratoga Springs Police, the FBI, and state forensics investigators brought in an excavator to dig up the property as well as ground penetrating radar. Saratoga Springs police spokesman Lt Robert Jillson said investigators were focused on a former garbage pit behind the structure. Jillson acknowledged they were looking for remains. “If there wasn’t the possibility, we wouldn’t be digging there”. ""We have reason to believe her remains are there,” Jillson stated. After two days of excavating the land, police ended the search of the property after not finding any evidence related to Tammie’s disappearance.

**Vital Statistics**

**Updated inaccuracies from previous reports:**

**\* Tammie went missing on April 19:** April 19th was a Saturday. Tammie went missing on Tuesday,  
April 29th after skipping school.

* **Tammie missed the bus and was going to hitchhike to school:** Tammie’s sister Jennifer stated that Tammie intended to skip school that day and had no intentions of going.
* **Tammie was last seen by her sister Jennifer at home:** Police reports indicate a girl matching Tammie’s description was last seen hitchhiking by a motorist, who picked her up and dropped her off near Saratoga Lake.

**After thoughts:**

It has been over 35 years since Tammie’s disappearance, and sadly, her disappearance is still a mystery. Police and family believe she is no longer alive, and police suspect Aurther Mason Slaybaugh II, a deceased man is her killer. It’s worth noting that a year prior in 1985, SUNY Albany student Karen Wilson mysteriously went missing near the SUNY campus in Albany without a trace, and has never been found. Where Karen went missing is about 45 minutes south of Sarataga Springs. In 1998 another SUNY student from Boston Spa, Suzanne Lyall also went missing near the SUNY campus and was never found. Her disappearance was 12 years after Tammie’s, but Karen’s was only 13 months prior. What are your thoughts? Do you think Slaybaugh is the guy as police do, or do you think it could be the work of a serial killer that was in the area who happened to come across Tammie hitchhiking? Could Tammie still be alive and out there somewhere?

Disclaimer: Now I want to start off by saying that this potential development is not a news story that you can search up related to the case. This is something I discovered myself while doing research into Michael Dunahee's case.

**What I Found:**

Ever since I first heard about Michael Dunahee's disappearance/abduction, I have been fascinated by the case and it has stuck with me ever since. There was something about it that always made me come back and revisit it every now and then. Something so bold and brazen about somebody abducting somebodies child in a busy parking lot on a day when many families had gathered at the Blanshard Elementary School for a game of touch football.

For those not familiar with the case , here is a link to the wiki article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance\_of\_Michael\_Dunahee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Michael_Dunahee)

Now here is what I found. While searching up videos on Youtube about the case, looking for any new and interesting info about the case, I came across a strange youtube channel. The channel is called ""rcmp is corrupt alberni"" and it is run by a man named Rick. The name in question; Rick, claims to be from Port Alberni. There is a small town called Port Alberni on Vancouver Island, the same island where Victoria is, Michael's home city where he disappeared.

Now this man makes a lot of wild claims like how the RCMP is gang stalking him and has been for years. But the most striking claim of all is that he claims to have the remains of two missing children in his possession. He never mentions the other child by name, but he specifically mentions Michael Dunahee by name and claims his remains is one of them. He claims to have had them for 30 years which is how long Dunahee has been missing. He says he is holding out on giving up the remains until he receives millions of dollars from the Canadian government.

Now i'm not quite sure what to make of this. I have thought about sending this info to the Victoria police, but I want your guys' opinion before I do. Maybe he was already investigated by the Victoria PD and cleared as a suspect or maybe he is actively being investigated right now.

Here is a link to his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ)

Here is a link to his most viewed video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfu-0XKUOV0&amp;list=UUYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ&amp;index=39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfu-0XKUOV0&amp;list=UUYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ&amp;index=39)

So what do you guys think? Is this all BS? Is the man simply just mentally ill? Or is he the one responsible for abducting Michael back in 1991? I'M NOT SAYING HE IS GUILTY OF TAKING MICHAEL, I HAVE NO PROOF. However I just find it odd that is channel popped up out of nowhere around three years ago and he is claiming to have the remains of missing children, including the remains of one of the most well known missing children, who is missing not far from where he lives.

Martin Crumblish attended a party at a popular clearing known as The View. The View was a local hang out spot, near the country club in Dobbs Ferry NY.

When questioned, other teens at the party stated that around 11:00 p.m. Martin had walked a female friend home before returning to the party.

Martin then left the party again around midnight and headed for his friend's house on Myrtle Avenue. This was the last time Martin Crumblish was seen alive. His wallet along with other personal items, were found near his last known location.

 Martin was supposed to be spending the night with a friend, they both had to take there SAT exams the next day. This friend didn’t recall seeing Martin after the party.

Martin was very popular amongst his peers. And although he was on the school football and baseball teams, he didn’t fit the typical stereotype. He was described as being very sensitive, an artistic person who enjoyed writing poetry. 

Martin's loved ones do not believe he would have ran away, they stated, he was very excited about a new job and wouldn’t have just left it, even if he had, he would have contacted his family eventually to tell them he was ok. That’s just the kind of kid he was. There has been no activity on his Social Security number since his disappearance.

In 2002, over twenty years after Martin's disappearance, his case was reclassified from a missing person to a probable homicide. Apparently He was having issues with some local kids at the time of his disappearance. Authorities believe he may have gotten into a fight and was, perhaps accidentally killed shortly after he was last seen. They have conducted several searches for his remans in the area but concisistantly turn up nothing.

Both of Martin's parents are still alive; his father lives in California and his mother in upstate New York. They continue to hope for break in his case, any ounce of closure at all would suffice.

Born January 7th 1964, making him 57 in the making of this video. Martin was a 17 year old Caucasian Male with blonde hair and blue eyes. He was 6ft tall and weighed around 165lb. He had a small substance abuse problem at the time. Do you or anyone you know have any information regarding to his disappearance? If you have any information please contact the Dobbs Ferry Police Department at 914-693-5500.

194,awpmag,[],1641070259,"Lousy police work, lawyers not following up on key witnesses and most alarming, a Sheriff Sgt that never sought critical information about how exactly the victim was killed. Did Arizona send an innocent man to die?

When a jury handed Barry Lee Jones a death sentence in 1995 for an unspeakable crime - the rape and murder of his girlfriend's four-year-old daughter - he remained adamant that he did not commit the act.

Almost 3,000 prisoners have been exonerated in the US since 1989 – including 186 innocent people who were condemned to death. 

It's estimated that between them they spent more than 25,000 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit.

Jones, who had children of his own, had been accused of killing Rachel Yvonne Gray in May 1994 at the Desert Vista Trailer Park in Tucson, where they all lived in a cramped trailer.

The death was caused by “a small bowel laceration due to blunt abdominal trauma,” according to court documents, which said she also suffered from a laceration to her left scalp, injuries to her vagina and “multiple internal and external” bruises.

## What happened?

Angela Gray, the little girl's mother, said she’d spent most of May 1 1994 sleeping but when she woke up, Jones told her Rachel had fallen out of his parked work van causing her to bleed on her head. 

He said he had taken her to the nearby Rural Metro Fire Station for medical attention.

After putting her to sleep, Gray found Rachel unresponsive the next morning, with her eyes rolled back in her head.

The couple took the girl to a Tucson hospital, where she was pronounced dead because of a bowel laceration from being hit in the abdomen, reported The Intercept.

But before the medical examiner had determined a cause of death, Jones became Pima County Sheriff Sgt Pesquiera’s sole suspect. 

This was because Jones had later admitted that he had actually lied about taking her to the fire station and getting checked up.

[Instead what happened was that he’d seen a police officer at the station and he didn't want to be caught driving with a suspended license. So he drove on to a Quik Mart store, where he spotted a paramedic.](https://www.awallprintss.com/post/barry-jones-death-row-prisons-usa)

196,MayhemInTheDesert,[],1641029239,"John Episioco accompanied his 5-year-old sister on their way to school in their Las Vegas neighborhood on the morning of October 20, 1997.  Episioco was no stranger to violence - he had witnessed his 13-year-old friend Alex Arroyo get gunned down as the two young teenagers sat in the back of a car in October of 1996. Episioco had testified in recent months against the killer of his friend, gang member Jerry Lara.  Episioco's testimony helped convict Lara of the murder of Alex Arroyo.

As he made his way to school, an unidentified teenager approached Episioco from behind and asked for a cigarette.  Without awaiting a response, the assailant produced a gun and fired a single round into the back of Episioco's head before fleeing the scene. Episioco would not survive his injuries.

Police did not publicly link the murder to Episioco's testimony against Lara in the aftermath of the slaying, but no one has ever been identified as the suspected gunman in the now almost 25-year-old murder.

Are there any new updates or information? It seems unsettling that very little is being released even if they're unsure if she's been abducted or just got lost.

For those unfamiliar with this case, Lina Sardar Khil was first reported missing on the evening of Dec. 20 after she was last seen at the Villa Del Cabo apartment complex in the 9400 block of  Fredericksburg.

Despite pouring massive resources into the search, along with a cash reward for information on her disappearance, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said a lack of tips hasn't brought them any closer to figuring out what happened to the child.

“There’s nothing that we haven’t done to try to find her,” McManus said. “It’s  frustrating and disheartening, disappointing that we haven’t come up  with something yet.”

Police have now shut down both command posts dedicated to the search, but  McManus said “there is no lessening of the intensity of the  investigation.”

This case just feels so underreported.

198,Red-neckedPhalarope,[],1640978862,"This is an odd one, and honestly based on what's available so far I don't hold out a lot of hope for a speedy resolution.

On September 26, 2021, a hiker on a Rails to Trails path in the town of Portland, Chautauqua County, NY, found part of a human skull. Investigators at the scene not only found more of that skeleton, but located another body soon after, only feet away. This was already highly unusual for a town of fewer than 5,000 people, but the circumstances around these two bodies were odder still.

The second body to be found was the first to be identified. 50-year-old Marquita Mull was last seen alive on June 25 and reported missing by her family on July 18 after they realized that she had not been checking in with her father as she usually did and hadn't picked up her most recent disability check. 

Mull really had an unfair hand in life. She struggled with her mental health, and in 2012 she was struck by a hit-and-run driver and left with permanent physical disabilities (including a TBI) as well. As a result of her disabilities she didn't drive and she didn't own a cell phone; she traveled around her hometown of Buffalo, NY, by foot or on the bus. Buffalo is more than 50 miles from Portland, and no public transit connects the two. Police and her family consider it virtually impossible that she could have gone to Portland on her own, and she had no known connection to the Portland area. 

The first-discovered, as-yet unidentified set of remains was much less recent -- likely decades old. Like Mull, they appeared to be female, but little else is known (or at least little else has been made public.) Dental records ruled out a connection to two of Chautauqua County's three open missing person cases: Lori Bova, who disappeared in 1997, and Corrie Anderson, missing since 2008. The third and oldest missing woman, Patricia Laemmerhirt (1976), has not yet been ruled out according to the most recent information I can find. DNA has been sent for testing and comparison to national missing persons cases, but if a match has been made, it's not public yet.

Both of the deaths are being considered foul play by law enforcement at this time, based on the fact that the bodies appear to have been dumped (and the Jane Doe was buried.)

Obviously this raises a lot of questions:

1. Who killed Marquita Mull, and why? Her family has been very active in getting her case out there and searching for answers, and doesn't seem to be under any suspicion (and if they were involved, dumping the body in Chautauqua County as opposed to someplace nearer to Buffalo makes very little sense.) She was vulnerable because of her disabilities and might have been targeted by someone who had seen her around the neighborhood, or a total stranger. If it was a neighbor, again, why go all the way to Chautauqua County to dump her, and how did they know the spot to do it? If it was someone from Portland or the surrounding area, why drive over an hour into Buffalo to find a victim?

2. Who is the Jane Doe? At this point it seems like our only hope is DNA, which may take some time. The remains must be fairly deteriorated if they can't even narrow them down to a decade, and if any personal effects were found that information hasn't been made public.

3. Did the same person kill two women decades apart and dump them within feet of each other? If so, what were they doing for all those years in between? Locked up? Killing elsewhere? On a break? There is another unsolved murder of a Jane Doe victim in Chautauqua County dating from 1983, but it seems very different M.O.-wise - that victim was left by the side of the road and found only hours after her death. If it wasn't the same person, why did two people choose this relatively out-of-the-way spot in a small town to dispose of bodies from, in at least one case, an entirely different part of WNY? It's not exactly the East River over there.

199,jokubas349,[],1640975185,"**December 29 marked exactly one year after Arnoldas Rakauskas mysteriously disappeared in Kaunas district, Lithuania. The young guy’s mother still lives in heartbreaking uncertainty. Although the search for her son is still fruitless, the woman does not lose hope that there are people who have seen or know something.**

“I live in waiting. The *\[last\]* search for my son took place in the spring *\[of 2021\].* From time to time, an investigator calls me and we talk. That’s pretty much how it is...” - said Jurgita, Arnoldas’ mother.

On December 29th, 2020, a 22-year-old Arnoldas visited a friend in Kazimierava village, in Kaunas district. Here, he had to stay overnight, but the next day he promised to return to his parent’s home in Jonava, where he lived. Arnoldas disappeared on the night from 29th to 30th of December. Police officials, cadaver dogs, divers and volunteers combed the surroundings of Kaunas district, moving toward Jonava immediately after the disappearance and then later, in the Spring, to no avail.  

Next day *\[31st of December\]*, the friends of Arnoldas started their own independent search, combing the surroundings of the Kazimierava village. “We organized everything ourselves. We gathered a group of people and were looking for Arnoldas within the radius of about 10-15 km *\[≈ 6.2 to 9.3 miles\]* from the village. We covered the radius, searched the forest more than once. I want to find him at any cost” - said Inesa, Arnoldas’ friend. According to Inesa, over 60 people gathered to look for the young man on Thursday morning. She mentioned currently combing the Ibenai area, emphasizing that the search should continue in the town of Vandziogala, Domeikava, and other areas. Inesa said the helicopter was used to search for Arnoldas’ whereabouts on Wednesday *\[30th of December\],* but the search was fruitless.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dreadful suspicions**

“Now that one year has passed, I feel like my son was probably killed, because if he was alive, he would have definitely given a sign. His disappearance is shrouded in mystery...” - barely holding back tears, said Arnoldas’ mom.

She added, looking for a way to access the records of unidentified human remains. “If I got the lists, I could review the period when my son disappeared. Because, for example, the remains of a person were found in Lampedziai *\[≈ 20km/12.4 miles from where Arnoldas dissapeared\]* and A. Juozapavicius Avenue *\[≈ 25km/15.5 miles\]*. Yet, no such access was granted, even though the police have my DNA. Maybe Arnoldas traveled to the opposite end of Lithuania and fell into a body of water” - considered Arnoldas’ mother.

Jurgita does not lose hope and trust that someone who knows about Arnoldas eventually will come forward and let her know. The young guy’s mother asks people to look at her son’s picture again. “Maybe someone offered him a lift or saw something, maybe someone will remember anything” - she said while crying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Told what happened**

As Jurgita told the journalists in the spring, Arnoldas was supposed to spend the evening and night with his friend’s family. Only these individuals *\[Arnoldas, his friend and friend’s wife with their son\]* were inside during the evening of disappearance. “I was told that my son and his friend went outside to smoke next to the gazebo. After they finished smoking, Arnoldas’ friend invited him back inside, because it was freezing and they were only wearing short-sleeved T-shirts. Arnoldas turned around and walked into the night”.

Arnoldas’ mom speculated that maybe the two of them argued and got into a fight, but was later told by Arnoldas’ friend that was not the case. A. Rakauskas, wearing a black T-shirt with white inscriptions, black jeans and dark-colored, almost black shoes, allegedly walked into the dark in an unknown direction. He had nothing left with him, his wallet with personal documents, keys and a mobile phone all stayed inside his jacket inside the friend’s place.

In the interview with Arnoldas' friend Inesa, she mentioned that the their friend's house is surrounded by forests and meadows. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Considered different scenarios**

According to A. Rakauskas’ mother, the said friend started looking for her son immediately after getting putting his shoes and jacket. After 20-30 minutes, a neighbour from the house next door joined the unsuccessful search for the young guy. “At 1am of the same night, police notified me that my son is missing. One hour later, police arrived at my door. I couldn’t understand what was happening at first, and I said that Arnoldas will come back, because he called me in the evening. He was a responsible child, we had a strong connection”.

Jurgita added that when she first heard the news, she thought Arnoldas was walking home, the distance of about 26 kilometers *\[≈ 16.1 miles\].* Arnoldas was always physically strong. He would probably have covered that distance. Speaking about this scenario, Arnoldas’ mother said she did not rule out the possibility that perhaps her soon, who decided to walk home that night, sat down and because he was a little drunk and froze to death, because it was chilly. “I do not blame his friend for the disappearance. When new information comes forward, we will know better. We considered different versions, including suicide. Could that have been the case? I don’t believe he could have done that, but there’s always a possibility.

Arnoldas Rakauskas disappeared on the evening of December 29th, at about 10:30 pm. The officials were notified of Arnoldas’ disappearance on the night of December 29th to December 30th, at about 12:38 am. When he left, Arnoldas was wearing black jeans and a dark shirt. Height - 185 cm *\[ ≈ 6.1 ft.\].* Hair colour - brown. He has a scar on his forehead.

Whilst this isn't your standard conventional case post I have posted (and apologies if this isn't allowed!), I have found whilst scouring the UK Missing Persons website (the site with listings and some images of the unidentified deceased within the country), a statistical snapshot of missing persons statistics regarding each police force within the United Kingdom.

As someone who is a bit of a stats geek (and only got a Grade C/4 pass grade at GCSE Maths at the age of 33), I find this information absolutely interesting. The link I have shared above provides a link to a number of reports that are produced with information that each police force supplies with reasons why people go missing, outcomes and some updates even on UDIs. Whilst 20/21 hasn't been uploaded yet and probably won't for a while due to issues with Covid-19; this post will dissect the findings in the most recent report.

Greater Manchester and the Metropolitan (covering London) forces produced the most missing persons reports with 35k and 56k respectively. Take in mind these are rather large geographical areas within the country and attract a number of tourists to their area. The force with the lowest was Wiltshire (excluding the small City of London area) was 2.1k. Some forces posted a decline over previous years with the West Midlands force area posting the biggest, which is fascinating for a large metropolitan area at -37.4%, whilst the biggest increase was Durham force area in North East England posting the biggest increase with 157.% but factor in this is a small area.

Sadly, the majority of missing person reports in the Metropolitan force area were reports to do with children, which took up a bulk of their reports over adults. Greater Manchester and West Midlands were not far behind with a high amount of missing children reports. Thankfully for those three forces, those numbers were down over 2018/9.

Males are more likely to be reported missing than females, and there were 319 transpeople who went missing during the 2019/20 period. 7.4% had no gender reported at all. The age groups which had the most missing people reports were 12-17 and 18-39 years. This is probably a reason why in some areas, there's a high amount of missing children as someone under 18 is classed as a child in the UK. 

The majority at 63% are medium-risk cases when reports were submitted and assessed. This could be people who are elderly and more vulnerable due to ill health, dementia or those with mental health issues or in a bad situation at home e.g potentially fleeing domestic abuse. 14% of reports provide no further risk at all. More females than males under 18 are reported as a Child Sexual Exploitation risk, whilst it's more common in males to be a mental health risk and that's within adults and children. 

On a positive note, most missing persons who are found are not harmed. Unfortunately this information is vague as not all police forces in the country provide informations. Most harm is either self-harm due to mental health issues or physical harm say in a confrontation or a fracture. 955 cases have sadly been fatal, with 26 of those being children. May those souls rest in peace and have a family and loved ones keeping their names alive. This was an increase of 6% unfortunately from 2018/9.

The vast majority of reasons why people go missing are a breakdown within a relationship albeit within a family or a partner, mental health issues and drugs or alcohol. Within those under 18 it's  juveniles who are unaccompanied without an adult or relationship breakdowns. Those over 65 years old are likely to go missing due to dementia which sadly is common due to the lack of capacity and having worked within care homes, an escapee was often a common occurrence. Thankfully many were home within a few minutes or hours. Sadly there have been a few cases in the public eye where someone with dementia has passed away whilst missing. 

There are 4543 long-term missing individuals within the UK. Scotland has 773 cases, whilst in England Devon and Cornwall tops the list with 707. According to a disclaimer at the bottom of this information, 42% of Scotland's 773 long-term missing have been presumed dead have died either due to a sea accident or no body can be recovered in the water. It'll be worth knowing, where there any unaccounted for with the Piper Alpha incident in the late 1980s? 

44 unidentified cases were reported in the 2019/20 with sadly 17 of these still unresolved. Most of those have been bodies or human remains (e.g feet, or a skull). The Metropolitan Police area was the one with the most unresolved cases with 5 (inc 1 for City of London). Again, I hope now with advances in DNA and technology we can get these resolved very soon so some families and friends of there get closure and their names are rightfully back to them. 

There are 974 unidentified cases across the whole of the UK. The majority of those are bodies. Interesting to note with statistics within the police force, Avon and Somerset have managed to have one case resolved in the last few years (be interesting to know which case it was), but unfortunately the picture overall is very few get resolved. 

There are a few points to take from these statistics:

There needs to be more emphasis on male mental health. It's the biggest killer amongst men and as a man, we shouldn't be afraid to show our feelings. The culture of maschismo which sadly is a part of the fabric in some communities across the country needs to die down. You can be masculine and cry guys!

Covid probably had a part to play with some of these figures, especially with those who were made homeless due to lockdown (the first one in March 2020 was strict!) or in a terrible situation at home. It was a very difficult situation and affected many people's mental health.

There needs to be more safety for girls and women. It's worrying to see how many missing girls are sexually exploited and something needs to be addressed about this. It's time people learned to respect women and girls and tougher punishments were put in force.

In the case of UDIs (Does), as I say with every post - there's got to be someone out there missing them. It's sad how so few get identified and you'd think with advances in technology, science and DNA we'd have some resolution with these. I'd love to wake up one day and find out on here or on a news website that the Clifton Suspension Bridge Doe has been formally identified or the Handsworth Park Doe has too. Whilst in the majority of these cases, time has passed - it's only right they have their names back!

Again, whilst this isn't anything too gritty and an opinion on a case - I hope this is fascinating for people to read and view the stats in full and base their opinions on this.",Results of UK Missing Persons Unit Statistics 2019/20 - Reasons why people go missing and stats regarding UDIs by each UK force

At one point it attracted ship builders, where they built extravagant homes complete with widow walks.

It’s a historic small town where everyone knows everyone, but beneath that fog lies some sordid secrets that hopefully will not stay hidden for long.

21 year old Zack Lefave missing on New Years 2021. got most of my information from Bring Zack Lefave Home Facebook (Source). By all accounts a great person who’s family and community are missing him dearly. He was hardworking and didn’t get into trouble, he worked at Red and White Grocery store in town behind the meat cutting counter. He was a homebody who liked to play video games with his friends. He always made sure other people’s needs were taken care of before his own. And a lot of the pictures I found of him looks like he was great with kids.

Zack LeFave disappeared mysteriously on New Years day. He was 4-wheeling with his friends up until 4pm that day. At 6pm he went to The Grand hotel on Main Street because a couple friends had a room there. From there they went to a part, which was about a 15 minute drive to Plymouth, they took a cab. The party was comprised of about 20 people, he didn’t really know anyone there. They arrive at the party at 11:25pm.

A friend who saw him says he was drunk, but a happy outgoing drunk, not like passed out, falling asleep drunk. At this party there were fishermen who were on call and had to go into work to catch fish, which is interesting there are on call fisherman on New Years and they were most likely drinking when they had to go into work. He decides to leave and walk home at 11:49pm.

11:49pm: 1st phone call using Facebook messenger to the friends at the party where he says he is in Quinton, which is a 5 hour walk from where he is from (Source) he says he is walking to Yarmouth from Quinton, which is a 6 your walk from Quinton (Source). There’s

NO WAY he’s in Quinton Nova Scotia thet fast so he sounds disoriented. Even still if he’s walking from Plymouth to Yarmouth it’s a 2.5 hour walk. During this phone call he jokes around and says he’s not wearing any pants and doesn’t seemed distressed. His pants were later found on Flint road along with his wallet, his hat, and his cigarettes.

11:54pm – Second phone call, says he is cold, thinks he is Quinton, not distressed.

11:58pm- phone call ends.

12:02pm – Disturbing phone cal where he says he is with PoC (black people) he doesn’t know, the phone call cuts off.

12:07 – last phone call and no one picks up.

12am: 1st eye witness sees him at Newell Road entrance

12:15am: 1st driver, sees him walking with traffic

12:15am: 2nd driver, same as above

12:25am Zack is seen walking again by the 1st eyewitness (he was going the wrong way and turned around)

12:45am: 1st driver from 12:15am returns back and doesn’t seem him

12:45am-1:00am: 2nd driver returns and doesn’t see Zack

12:25am-12:45am: Something happened to zack with this area (Source)

Zack was reported missing 2 hours after he left the party

An extensive search was done on January 2nd including ground and water searches, but no trace of Zack was ever found

The search was suspended and the family took over and did a thorough job

Theories

Hit and Run

Zack was walking alone drunk on the side of a highway one New Years Eve where people might have been drinking and driving. At 4am that morning a family member went to go look for Zack. No signs of hit and run such as blood on the street

Foul Play

His girlfriend Hanna says she got his phone records and there was an anonymous number with an unknown location was texting him. A family friend says there are a few names that keep popping up. Colton Cook was murdered in the area in September 2020 by 2 people who were apprehended.

I believe it’s possible that these texts were him arranging to possibly meet up with someone. His wallet was found along with his pants.

This reminds me of the Luke Joly-Durocher who’s dissapeared in North Bay, Ontario and who’s debit card was found in a snow bank down the street from his last known location. One of the prevailing theories is that he was met with foul play because he didn’t have cash on hand.

The family is searching for answers.

207,SniffleBot,[],1640812691,"Yesterday evening, it was announced [that by a 4-3 margin the New Jersey Supreme Court had vacated the 2016 murder conviction](https://www.nj.com/news/2021/12/michelle-lodzinski-leaves-prison-hours-after-nj-supreme-court-tosses-her-murder-conviction.html) of Michelle Lodzinski for [the 1991 death of her 5-year-old son, Timothy Wiltsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Timothy_Wiltsey). The majority found the evidence insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Lodzinski had committed murder.

To [recap](https://www.nj.com/news/2021/05/its-been-30-years-since-5-year-old-timothy-wiltsey-was-killed-the-case-against-his-mother-is-still-ongoing.html):

On May 25, 1991, Lodzinksi, then a resident of South Amboy, took the boy, whom she had been raising as a single mother after having divorced his father and returning to NJ following a brief marriage in Iowa, to a Memorial Day weekend carnival in nearby Sayreville. While some doubt has been expressed about this, neighbors did see the two leave the house that day.

After she took him on three rides, they went for some ice cream, right around sunset. He was, she said, right behind her in line as she ordered and paid for two cones. He was there, and, five seconds later when she looked back, he was gone. She couldn't find him in the nearby crowd, so she went to the police to report a missing child. The search, until 2 a.m.,  eventually forced the carnival to close early; it was resumed at dawn.

Police searched the entire 10-acre park where the carnival was held, with helicopters and dogs augmenting the foot presence. There was no trace of Tim; they said later they were satisfied that if he was anywhere he wasn't in the park, and the efforts turned to the usual massive news coverage and people handing out fliers everywhere. *America's Most Wanted* featured the case. Wiltsey's father was back in Iowa the whole time and quickly ruled out as a suspect.

But over the next couple of weeks, the police began to have doubts. Within the first three weeks of the investigation, she changed her story twice.

First, she came clean and ""admitted"" that she'd run into some woman named ""Ellen"" who she used to see at the bank where she worked as a teller, accompanied by a man she hadn't seen before; she thought Ellen worked as a go-go dancer somewhere, or at least had, and she didn't know/remember the woman's last name. Ellen offered to briefly watch Tim while she got the ice cream, but when she came back Ellen, the man, and her son were all gone. She just didn't want to tell *anyone* that she'd left her son in the (however brief) care of someone she didn't know well.

OK. So the police took the clues that she gave and tried to find Ellen. Apparently they didn't get anything that might have been a result, so they went back and confronted Lodzinski with this a week later. This time she said that the man had put a knife to her throat and told her not to tell anyone what had happened; she'd get her son back in a month if she stayed quiet, and this was what she was *really* afraid of. This breakthrough came after hours of questioning that ended with Lodzinski going to the hospital for hyperventilation.

On the other side, Lodzinski and her relatives told the police that at the time her plans for the near future definitely included Timmy: she'd gotten his kindergarten graduation gown, and made plans for the two of them to visit family in Florida.

The summer wore on and Wiltsey's face was put on tons of milk cartons around the state. But Lodzinski herself rarely appeared, and when she did seemed rather unemotional. She blamed the media, saying at one press conference in the fall that she didn't get emotional in public and wasn't about to start so they could have visual of her crying. She announced she might well be moving to get away from them.

In October, a sneaker matching Lodzinski's description of the ones her son had been wearing when he went missing was found near the woods at the back of an office park in nearby Edison. This led to the discovery of Tim's body in a muddy brook in those woods, near the Raritan River, the next April, nearly 11 months to the day after he went missing. The remains were too decomposed to determine the cause of death.

He was buried the next month. A week later, the police made public the twists and turns in Lodzinski's story from a year earlier, as well as the fact that she had only told them after the body was discovered that she had once worked in the nearby office park, and that she had failed two lie detector tests (inadmissible as evidence in NJ in any event). Her public sympathy took a huge hit, but there was no break in the case.

What there *would* be was another case. For a day, Michelle herself became a missing person. In January 1994 her brother found her car out in front of his apartment in another town in northeastern Middlesex County with the door open and the engine running. The very next day she was found in downtown Detroit, where she told police she had been abducted by some guys claiming to be FBI and taken the several hundred miles there. The real FBI didn't believe this.

It turned out later that this happened right after she had learned that she was about to be subpoenaed. Not in her son's case, but in that of a friend, a cop in a neighboring county who had apparently been running plates for her of vehicles she suspected of following her around. In any state this is actionable misuse of that data base.

A grand jury no-billed him, but in March 1995 Lodzinski pled guilty to having falsified the kidnapping after having taken a bus to Detroit. She got three years probation and modified house arrest.

But she couldn't stay out of trouble. Three years later she was in criminal court again, charged with stealing a $3,100 laptop (wow ... those *were* the days!) from a former (emphasis *former*) employer so she could give it to someone as a Christmas gift. She again pled guilty, and got another three-years stretch of probation plus a day ... a whole *day* ... in jail for violating her previous probation, followed by four months of unambiguous house arrest at a time when you couldn't work from home so easily.

After that was over, she must have decided she'd had it with New Jersey, moving to Minnesota and then, eventually, Florida, where she again married briefly and had two more children, who are both still alive (both of whom she told of Timmy, whose pictures she still kept around the house). She told a newspaper reporter who caught up with her that while she'd always have a past, she was otherwise just like anyone else around her and her life was getting back to normal again.

In the early 2010s the county prosecutor's office decided to take a serious look at the case again, offering a reward for any new information that could solve the case. Suspicion of Lodzinski had only increased with her late '90s shenanigans, and it must have gotten old having to say again and again that there wasn't enough evidence to charge her, as much as that was true. In the evidence they thought they had found their smoking gun: a blanket found near the body that three former babysitters and family members said was one they'd seen in her house before Wiltsey disappeared.

So, in 2014, they trooped down to Port St. Lucie with an arrest warrant based on a sealed indictment and brought Lodzinski back to New Jersey in cuffs to face trial. Her lawyers, as lawyers often do, made a whole host of motions to prevent that trial from even starting. The primary one was that the evidence was not only insufficient to convict on its face, it wasn't enough even for an indictment. It took over a year for the trial judge to rule in the prosecution's favor on that one, saying that even though the case was largely circumstantial the shortfall in evidence was not ""egregious"".

After that, trial finally got underway in March 2016. The blanket and the related witnesses were the centerpiece of the state's case, with the argument that the social and economic pressures of single motherhood were motive enough (*à la* Casey Anthony) for her to kill her son. Her defense argued that the blanket was a red herring, and that the site where the body was discovered was tainted as the police had made serious mistakes processing it. The jury foreman was dismissed after it was discovered that he was independently investigating the case online; the defense motion for a mistrial was denied. Lodzinski did not take the stand.

Lodzinski was convicted after two months and sentenced in September to 30 years without parole, the minimum sentence for murder in New Jersey. She appealed, an arguing the evidence was insufficient, but [in 2019 an appellate court sustained the conviction](https://www.nj.com/news/2019/08/court-upholds-lodzinskis-conviction-in-decades-old-nj-murder-of-her-young-son.html). She and her lawyers decided to continue to the state Supreme Court.

In 2021 that court agreed to hear the case. The Chief Justice recused himself, for reasons undisclosed because like U.S. Supreme Court justices New Jersey's aren't required to explain why they have chosen to recuse themselves. The remaining six justices deadlocked, leaving the previous appeal intact and Lodzinski in prison.

At this point, in one of those plot twists that you'd walk out of a movie if it happened there, her lawyers got the state Supreme Court to invoke a rarely-used rule that allows it to grant a rehearing in such a case if it can appoint a substitute justice. That judge, a chief judge from the state's appellate courts, broke the tie in favor of [vacating the conviction for insufficient evidence](https://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/assets/opinions/supreme/a_50_19.pdf?c=OZS) and, after it was announced yesterday, she walked out of prison, never to have to face criminal prosecution for her son's death again (Although the taint of suspicion will always linger, I'm sure).

Now that this case is formally back to being a unsolved death again, I looked around to see if it had been discussed here before and found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4lh38r/michelle_lodzinski_has_this_25_year_cold_case/) from five and a half years ago when Lodzinski was convicted. The OP doesn't seem quite sure about the conviction, and some of the comments seem like their authors would not be at all surprised that it's ended this way (well, the prosecution *could* appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but given that this appeal was primarily granted based on a factual issue it is extremely unlikely to me that a cert petition would get even *one* justice interested, to say nothing of four. But ... the state has five months).

So ... today, what do we think?

For my part I agree with the NJSC majority but *only* in the sense that the prosecution did not overcome reasonable doubt. Too much of the circumstantial evidence requires conjecture and speculation to get to murder, especially given that we are not even certain of *when* Wiltsey died and do not know how. The blanket was a start toward making a case, but I would have wanted to see better proof that the blanket could only have come from Lodzinski's house. How rare was it?

But this case isn't one where I am comfortable in rejoicing that a wrongly convicted innocent has seen justice served. I would still consider Michelle a person of interest at least, and frankly if a jury could have been allowed to choose the old Scottish verdict of ""not proven"", I would be comfortable with that. Because with the same eye that I agree that there isn't enough evidence to sustain a conviction, there also isn't enough evidence to make me comfortable excluding her, or coming up with an alternate theory that implicates someone or something else. And ... after all, we *know* because she *pleaded guilty* to it that she went to some lengths to make it look like she herself had been kidnapped.

Is there any possibility of a third theory to all this? That while she might not be directly responsible for her son's death, she may know something that she's withheld all these years that, while it might have more definitely acquitted her of murder, would not have been something she'd want the public to know about her? (The two later versions of her story, making it look more like an abduction, seem to hint at this). Anyone have any ideas?","New Jersey Supreme Court vacates Michelle Lodzinski's conviction; death of her son, Timothy Wiltsey, now officially unsolved again"
208,bizzbuzzbizzbuzz,[],1640807942,"Starting in 1976, the small town of Circleville, Ohio has been plagued by a mystery that has yet to be solved – a series of anonymous letters sent to Circleville residents claiming to know their deepest, darkest secrets and threatening to expose them to the town. These letters sent shockwaves through the town and ignited a series of events that would result in accusations of murder, adultery, and other bizarre happenings.

**The Bus Driver &amp; the Superintendent**

On March 3, 1977, a letter arrived at Westfall High School addressed to school superintendent [Gordon Massie](https://imgur.com/iwEVOfd). The letter was hand written in a distinctive block letter style and accused Massie of having an affair with a married school bus driver in Circleville. The writer told Massie to confess his affairs to the school board. The very next day, the writer sent a letter to the Westfall School Board telling them about Massie’s affair with one of the drivers. These letters, as well as all of the Circleville letters, were [postmarked Columbus, Ohio](https://imgur.com/lr0oQ4v), which is about 25 miles north of Circleville.

The main target of the writer’s harassment would turn out to be one of these bus drivers, [Mary Gillispie](https://imgur.com/xV012co). Near the start of the letter writer’s campaign of harassment, Mary Gillispie found a [handwritten letter](https://imgur.com/i6I8eUO) in her mailbox accusing her of having an affair with Gordon Massie. In this first letter, the writer claimed they had been “observing \[Mary\] and her children” and stated that “everyone concerned had been notified and everything will be over soon.” At this point, Mary shared the letter with her husband, Ron Gillispie, but denied she was having an affair with Gordon Massie.

A short time later in March 1977, Ron received [another letter–](https://imgur.com/D0znLQy)this one telling him that he needed to admit that his wife was having an affair with Massie. The letter told him to inform the Westfall school board of the affair and said that, if he did not, he would be killed. Once again, the Gillispies kept this letter quiet. Two weeks later, another letter was sent to the Gillispies; once again, the writer addressed Ron, telling him: “you have had 2 weeks and done nothing. Make \[Mary\] admit the truth and inform the school board.” At this point, both Mary and Ron had received letters threatening them and their children if Mary didn’t admit to the affair with Gordon Massie. In addition to the letters, there were also phone calls to the Gillispie home and offensive signs posted along Mary’s bus route; many of these signs made offensive/explicit references to the Gillispie’s young daughter.

From the beginning, Mary suspected the letters were being sent by David Longberry, a fellow bus driver who had expressed romantic interest in her and whom she had rejected. Determined to get to the bottom of who was writing the letters, Mary and Ron reached out to Ron’s sister, Karen Freshour, and her husband, [Paul](https://imgur.com/hDxB1KS). Paul’s sister was also told about the letters, but at this time, no one else knew about them. Since Mary believed David Longberry was the writer, the five of them (the Gillispies, the Freshour, and Paul’s sister) decided to write their own letter to David, telling him they knew he was the writer. The letters stopped for a few weeks, so they thought they had identified the writer and put a stop to the letters. But a few weeks later, the letters resumed and a tragedy occured.

**An Accident–or Murder?**

On August 19, 1977, Ron received a phone call at home that enraged him. He told his daughter that the call was from the letter writer, and he got his gun, ran to his truck, and drove off into the night.  Ron Gillispie’s [truck was found at 10:35pm that night crashed into a tree](https://imgur.com/9X7yW5m) with Ron’s body inside; he had died of major internal injuries.

Many Circleville residents believed that Ron’s death was not an accident–it was murder. After all, the letter writer had threatened Ron’s life if he didn’t expose his wife’s affair. In particular, Ron’s brother-in-law, Paul Freshour, believed that Ron had been murdered after uncovering the identity of the letter writer. There were essentially two pieces of evidence that supported the murder theory: 1) Ron was not a heavy drinker, but his blood alcohol level was 1.5x the acceptable amount, and 2) Ron’s gun was found under his body, and it appeared that one round had been fired sometime between when he left his house and his body was found.

The sheriff at the time, Dwight Radcliff, originally suspected foul play was involved in Ron’s death and there was even a person of interest in the case who was interviewed and given a polygraph test (which they passed; the person of interest has never publicly been identified). But after the coroner, Dr. Ray Caroll, examined the body, and found the high blood alcohol level, Sheriff Radcliff changed his mind and believed Ron’s death was an accident caused by drunk driving.

But apparently Sheriff Radcliff had motivation to cover up a possible murder as he was running for President of the National Sheriff’s Association, and a town plagued by not only an unhinged letter writer, but one who had turned to murder, wouldn’t be a good look for the President of this organization. The letter writer was also frustrated by the lack of investigation into the case and [wrote letters claiming that Sheriff Radcliff was covering up the truth of Ron’s death](https://imgur.com/gBpyAeC). Letters also accused Dr. Caroll, the coroner, of sexual abuse of young children.

After Ron’s death, the harassment continued, with letters being sent not just to Mary, but to citizens around town, to the newspaper, to local businesses, to schools–-basically to everyone in Circleville. Other residents were scared since the letter writer seemed completely unhinged and knew details of their lives that a stranger should have no way of knowing. Meanwhile, [Paul Freshour continued to insist that Ron had been murdered](https://imgur.com/5xnYfc8) and even filed a report requesting that the FBI investigate Ron’s death.

And though Mary had always denied having an affair with Gordon Massie while her husband was alive, after his death, she and Massie did begin a romantic relationship. At this point, the threats against her became more vicious, including explicit threats against Mary’s daughter.

**A Break in the Case**

On February 7, 1983, Mary was driving her school bus near Five Points Pike, when she saw a sign posted along a nearby fence. The sign was handwritten and included an obscene message about Mary’s 13 year-old daughter. Mary pulled over and attempted to remove the sign, but when she pulled on it, she saw that it was attached to a box with some twine. Mary decided to take the box home, and when she opened it she found a gun inside. Mary brought the box to the sheriff’s office, who determined the box was a booby trap that had been designed to fire the gun when the sign was pulled down. For some reason, the booby trap did not trigger when Mary removed the sign.

This booby trap became the first real break in the case, as the sheriff’s office was able to identify the gun used in the booby trap as belonging to Paul Freshour. Paul admitted the gun was his, but claimed it had gone missing weeks before, and denied setting the trap; he had also not reported the gun missing prior to this, so there was no evidence to support his claim.

The sheriff’s office then told Paul to copy one of the Circleville letters and try to emulate the handwriting of the letter–a practice that is very much not proper procedure when comparing handwriting. Usually, the suspect is asked to write a sample in his own handwriting, not to attempt to copy the handwriting. In addition to the handwriting sample, Ron Freshour failed a polygraph test and his ex-wife, Karen, told police he was behind the letters to Mary. Karen was the first to link Paul to the letters.

But, as with everything with this case, there’s more to the story. Karen and Paul had recently gone through an acrimonious divorce after Karen cheated on Paul. Paul was awarded custody of their three children and Karen ended up living in a trailer in Mary Gillispie’s backyard, so Karen certainly seems to have a motive for framing Paul. She also would have had access to his gun. And despite telling police that she had access to the letters, including letters Paul had written and not mailed, she could not produce any of these, telling police that she had disposed of them.

As for additional evidence connecting Paul to the booby trap, there was none. Paul had an alibi for the day the booby trap was set; he was at home because there was work being done on his house. Paul also fully cooperated with law enforcement and was only connected to the letters based on an accusation from his ex-wife after a very contentious divorce.

Using Karen’s testimony, the copied letters, the failed polygraph, and the fact that the gun in the box was registered to Paul Freshour, he was charged with attempted murder of Mary Gillispie. Paul was never charged with sending any of the letters, but they were used as evidence against him in his trial. There was also no physical evidence connecting Paul to either the letters or the booby trap. But he was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 7-25 years in prison.

**Case Closed?**

At this point, it seemed as though the mystery of the Circleville Writer had been solved. The only problem with this theory? The letters continued even after Paul Freshour was imprisoned. Even Paul himself received a letter, this one stating “Now when are you going to believe you aren’t going to get out of there? I told you two years ago. When we set ‘em up, they stay set up. Don’t you listen at all?”

Now, clearly, it is possible for people in prison to write and send letters, so the prison took numerous measures to ensure that Paul could not write these letters while in prison. These measures included putting Paul in solitary confinement, where he had no access to pen, paper, or the mail. And yet, letters continued to be sent during this time. Repeated sweeps of Paul Freshour’s cell showed no evidence that he wrote any of these letters in prison, he was regularly strip searched, and all of his incoming and outgoing mail was examined. Eventually, the prison warden wrote a letter to Paul’s ex-wife Karen telling her that it was impossible that Paul was writing these letters from his cell.

Additionally, Paul Freshour was imprisoned in Lima, Ohio, but all the letters (dating back from the first letters sent in 1976) were postmarked in Columbus, Ohio, so it is not clear how letters sent from a prison in Lima to Circleville would be postmarked Columbus.

In 1993, the television show *Unsolved Mysteries* was set to air a segment on the Circleville Letter Writer. Prior to the filming of this episode, the producers of the show received a postcard that said: ""Forget Circleville, Ohio. ... If you come to Ohio, you el sickos will pay. The Circleville writer."" The producers were undeterred and the segment was filmed and broadcast, including an interview with Paul Freshour, who had just been released on parole. This postcard was one of the final communications sent from the Circleville Letter Writer. No letters were sent after 1994.

**The Writer Unmasked?**

In August 2021, the CBS show *48 Hours* aired an episode that they claimed definitively identified the Circleville Letter Writer through forensic document examination. CBS hired a document examiner, Beverley East, who compared the Circleville Letters to Paul Freshour’s known handwriting. She found numerous links between the letter writer’s handwriting and Paul’s handwriting, especially in the formation of his numbers. East said there were patterns in the anonymous letters that did not match Paul’s handwriting, but found more than 100 “quirks” of Paul’s writing that did match.

However, not all of the experts agree that Paul Freshour is responsible for writing the letters. Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole does not believe there is enough evidence to state that Paul was the letter writer. In particular, O’Toole points to the letters that were sent while Paul was in prison. Since it was physically impossible for Paul to write and send these letters, it seems clear that there had to be another person involved. It should be noted that there were not just a couple of letters sent during the 10 years of Paul’s incarceration, but that there were literally hundreds of letters sent to people all over central Ohio. O’Toole also believes the letters were written by a female writer and that the letter writer was not well educated. Paul Freshour had three college degrees, including a Master’s degree.

So, despite the claims of *48 Hours*, it is clear that they did not, in fact, definitively identify the letter writer. The question of who wrote the letters, who set the booby trap for Mary Gillispie, and whether Ron Gillispie died as a result of an accident or foul play has yet to be answered even 45 years later.

**Some Additional Information**

Paul Freshour was released on parole in 1994 after spending 10 years in prison. He maintained his innocence until his death in 2012 at the age of 70. After his release, he maintained a [website dedicated to professing his innocence](https://circlevilleletters.wordpress.com/).

Dr. Ray Caroll, the county coroner who claimed that Ron Gillispie died with a BAC of 2x the legal limit, and who was accused by the Circleville Writer of child molestation, was charged with 12 counts of gross immorality, sex crimes, corruption of a minor, pornography, obscenity, and indecent exposure in December 1993.

David Longberry, the school bus driver Mary Gillispie originally suspected of writing the letters back in 1977, raped an 11 year-old girl in 1999. He went on the run and is still currently a fugitive.

The letter writer also made accusations against Roger Kline, the prosecutor who helped to convict Paul Freshour, but those are a bit harder to confirm. Specifically, he was accused of having an affair with a schoolteacher and then having her murdered when he found out she was pregnant. But, despite some random couple in Ohio “confirming” this story to a TV news station, there is literally no evidence of this. Kline became an appellate court judge before retiring in 2013.

While Paul was serving his time in prison, a fellow school bus driver of Mary’s came forward and said they had seen a large man with sandy-hair in a yellow El Camino standing at the site of the booby trapped sign on February 7, 1983, about 20 minutes before Mary found the sign. When the bus driver passed by, the man turned away from her so she could not see his face. Paul Freshour has dark hair and is not a large man, so he was clearly not the man that was seen by the bus driver. Karen, Paul’s ex-wife, was, however, dating a man who was large and sandy-haired. Her brother also drove an El Camino. Police chose not to follow up on this tip.

**Final Thoughts**

While Paul Freshour was convicted of setting the booby trap intended to kill Mary Gillispie in part based on the anonymous letters, neither he, nor anyone else, has ever been charged with writing the Circleville letters. Additionally, Paul Freshour’s conviction was based solely  on circumstantial evidence. And, while Paul’s conviction relied on the idea that he was the letter writer (and that the letter writer and the person who set the booby trap were one and the same), it is impossible that he is responsible the hundreds of letters that were sent while he was in prison. One theory of the letters is that there were multiple letter writers, not just one. This would explain how the letter writer knew secrets about such a large group of people (literally hundreds of people in Central Ohio received these letters) as well as how the letters continued after Paul Freshour was put in prison. While it's unlikely that there would be numerous letter writers who all managed to keep this huge secret for over 40 years, it's not possible to rule it out.

Another odd element of this case is the glaring absence of Gordon Massie from all of the reporting of the events. The most vitriolic letters were sent to or about Massie; the sign that was booby-trapped included a message that Mary’s 12 year-old daughter was involved in a sexual relationship with Massie. Massie was also the target of the early letters and, despite Mary Gillispie’s denial of an affair with Massie, the two did have a romantic relationship after Ron’s death. And yet, there is very little information about Massie available, despite the huge amounts of information for many of the other people involved in the case. Massie was a well-respected member of the Circleville community and was married with a son. He died in 1996.

No letters have been sent since 1994 and a number of the people involved in the case have since died. And yet no one has ever come forward with any information about the Circleville Letter Writer, so it seems that this is one mystery that may never be solved.

209,VastArt663,[],1640803840,"Suzanne Jovin was Born on January, 26, 1977 who was a German born American senior who studied at the Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. 

Murder 

Suzanne Jovin Was dropping off the penultimate draft of her senior essay on the terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden. Approximately at 4:15 pm on Friday Of December,4 1998 Suzanne was making Preparations for a pizza making party which she organized at the trinity Lutheran church on 292 Orange street for the Local chapter of Best Buddies a International organization that brings together students and mentally disabled adults. By 8:30 after she stayed up late to help clean up. She was driving a another volunteer home in a Borrowed University station wagon. At Approximately 8:45  she returned to her car to yale owned lot on the corner of Edgewood and howe street  and she proceeded to walk two blocks to her second block apartment at 258 Park street upstairs from yale Police Substation. Sometime prior on 8:50 pm A few friends of Jovin had passed by to her window and had asked her if she wanted to join them to watch a  movies with them.  Jovin Declined stating that she planned to do school work that night. At 9:02 Jovin logged onto her Yale Email account and told a female friend of hers in German that she was going to leave some GRE books for her own in Jovin\`s apartment buildings lobby. A unknown person who was unnamed offered to borrow the books from her and she gave her code to her door however that unnamed person wasn\`t identified. 

  Shortly after Jovin headed out on foot to the Yale police communications center under the arch at Phelps Gate on Yale's Old Campus to return the keys to the car she had borrowed. Shortly before reaching her destination, around 9:22, Jovin encountered her classmate Peter Stein, who was out for a walk. Stein is quoted by the Yale Daily news as saying, ""She did not mention plans to go anywhere or do anything else afterward. She just said that she was very, very tired and that she was looking forward to getting a lot of sleep.""[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-4) Stein also said Jovin was not wearing a backpack, was holding one or more sheets of white 8 ½ x 11 inch paper in her right hand, that she was walking at a ""normal"" pace and did not look nervous or excited, and that their encounter lasted only two to three minutes.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-5)

Based on that timeline, Jovin is presumed to have returned the keys to the borrowed car at about 9:25. She was reportedly last seen alive at between 9:25–9:30 by another Yale student, on foot returning from a Yale hockey game, ""walking north on College Street"".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-VF-2) However, it was later clarified, ""It is unclear... whether Jovin was walking somewhere, waiting for someone or pausing to admire the holiday lights along the New Haven Green.

At 9:55 pm, The police were called after a passerby witnessed a  woman bleeding at the corner of Edgehill Road and East Rock Road, 1.9 miles from the Yale campus, where Jovin was last seen alive. When police arrived at 9:58, they found Jovin fatally stabbed 17 times in the back of her head and neck and her throat slit. She was lying on her stomach, feet in the road, body on the grassy area between the road and the sidewalk. She was fully clothed and still wearing her watch and earrings, with a crumpled dollar bill in her pocket. Her wallet was later found to be still in her room. Suzanne Jovin was officially pronounced dead at 10:26 pm at Yale New Haven Hospital. 

Items and Observations were reported by police as evidence  by the Police and media however none of it has been discredited, deemed Hearsay or Unreliable  and explained. One of the Physical evidence found by authorities was DNA  which were found in the scrapings  taken from the fingernail of Jovin\`s left hand, Fingerprints  and a Unknown person partial  palmprint was also found  

on a Fresca bottle in the bushes in front of where her body was found,[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com1-8) and 3) the tip of the knife used in the attack that was lodged in her skull.

The most notable observations appear to be 1) ""a tan or brown van stopped in the roadway facing east, immediately adjacent to where Suzanne was found."",[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-10) 2) ""a man in his 20s or 30s with an athletic build, well-groomed hair, dark pants, a loose-fitting greenish jacket, running like his life depended on it in the opposite direction from where Suzanne Jovin was killed"",[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com2-11) and 3) ""A mysterious, nondescript 'someone,' whom Jovin mentioned in an e-mail she sent less than an hour before she was found stabbed"" to whom she had lent a friend's [GRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRE) test study materials.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-YDN1-3)

The only speculation about the murder weapon came on the March 1, 2000 broadcast of [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company)'s [*20/20*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20/20_(U.S._TV_series)). According to host John Miller's voiceover: ""The medical examiner would later identify only one of the 17 stab wounds as fatal. He would also determine that the murder weapon was a four to five inch nonserrated, carbon steel knife, when he discovered the tip of the blade lodged in the left side of her skull.""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com-6) The New Haven police have never revealed whether any tests have ever been done to determine a precise make and model of the knife.

Though there have been no reports of anyone witnessing Jovin enter or exit any vehicle, it is generally assumed that Jovin had either forcibly or voluntarily entered one, as it was virtually impossible for her to have reached the intersection of Edgehill and East Rock Roads by foot in the short span of time that elapsed between when she was last seen alive and when she was found bleeding by witnesses nearly two miles away. The existence of the tan/brown van was not made public by the [New Haven Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Police_Department) (NHPD) until March 27, 2001. Although members of the Yale faculty had reported the police were asking privately about the van at the inception of the investigation, no explanation has ever been given why it took more than two years to release the information to the public. And although the [*New Haven Register*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Register) reported on November 8, 2001, that the NHPD had impounded a brown van as part of the Jovin investigation, no link has ever been confirmed.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-12)

The existence of the Fresca bottle came to light on April 1, 2001, by [*Hartford Courant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Courant) reporter Les Gura.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-13) The only store in the vicinity of campus that sold Fresca that was still open at the hour Jovin was last seen alive was Krauszer's Market on York Street near Elm Street – precisely one block south of Jovin's apartment. Although Krauszer's maintained a video recording of its customers for security purposes, the police never asked to view their tape and have never reported seeking assistance from store employees or customers about whether they had seen anything unusual that night. The foreign palmprint has yet to be identified and public calls for DNA evidence to be extracted from it and other potential sources have gone unheeded.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-14)

The first mention of the existence of the fingernail DNA was on October 26, 2001, following a solicitation by the New Haven police for colleagues, friends and acquaintances of Jovin to come forward and give DNA samples voluntarily.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-15) No explanation has ever been given as to why it took nearly three years for the fingernail scrapings to be tested for DNA. On September 14, 2009, Jovin's parents wrote to Connecticut Governor [M. Jodi Rell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Jodi_Rell) that ""potential forensic investigations, made possible by significant advances in technology in the intervening decade, are not being carried out due to shortcomings in the Connecticut Forensic Science Laboratory."" Rell's office admitted that the lab also had a backlog of 12,000 DNA samples that needed to be tested.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-16) The DNA results from material collected under a fingernail of Jovin's left hand remained unmatched until November 2009. It was determined at that time that the DNA matched that of a trace evidence technician in the Connecticut State Police Forensics Laboratory, and was the result of accidental evidence contamination at the lab.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-17)

At the end of June 2008, the Jovin Task Force revealed that only days after the crime: ""A female motorist told police at the time that she was driving in the area of Whitney Avenue and Huntington Street at about 10 p.m. when she saw a white male sprint past her and disappear into the church property.""[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com2-11) As for why this testimony was withheld from the public for nearly a decade: ""Sources said the police at the time showed her a photo of Yale Professor James Van de Velde — Jovin's thesis adviser, whom police had publicly identified as a suspect — to determine if he was the man she saw. They also took her in an unmarked van to Van de Velde's office so she could look at him in person. She told them Van de Velde was not the man she saw running, and investigators didn't contact her again, sources said.""[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-18) Subsequently, the Jovin Task Force began hanging a sketch of this person around the neighborhood in which he was spotted.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 16, 2008, the Jovin Task Force provided further details of Jovin's final email, written in German to a female friend, about [GRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRE) test study materials Jovin would leave for her to pick up. ""Jovin wrote that she would retrieve the books and leave them in the foyer of her apartment for the classmate to pick up, giving her classmate the code to her apartment in case Jovin was not in the building.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-YDN1-3) The materials were never returned, nor has anyone ever come forward as the borrower, leading many to speculate the borrower may have possibly been involved in her killing. Furthermore, Jovin's specific use of the word ""someone"" when referring to the borrower implies to many she did not know this borrower very well.

## 

Four days after the murder, the name of Jovin's thesis advisor, James Van de Velde, was leaked to the as the prime suspect in the case. Fifteen months later, criminologist John Pleckaitis, then a sergeant at the New Haven Police Department, admitted to Hartford Courant reporter Les Gura: ""From a physical evidence point of view, we had nothing to tie him to the case ... I had nothing to link him to the crime."" Famed criminologist Henry Lee\`s offer to reconstruct the crime scene was accepted by the police but not carried out. What\`s even more interesting is that James Van de Velde was a Ph d  in international  security studies. In 1988 he was selected for a prestigious [Presidential Management Internship](http://www.fbi.gov/employment/presin.htm) for those interested in and committed to a career in federal government. He was appointed to work at the Pentagon and State Department by the first Bush administration for nuclear weapons arms control. He was also a lieutenant commander in the **U.S. Naval Intelligence** Reserves. He [worked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Jovin_case) on the Dayton Peace Accords in 1997 as a mobilized reservist performing a voluntary active duty assignment for the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command. He’s analyzed the drug trade out of Latin America. Students reportedly  heard **rumors that he worked for the C.I.A.  James Van de** Was the executive director at Stanford's [Asia-Pacific Research Center](http://aparc.stanford.edu/docs/about/) And perhaps the most eye-opening, he **had a** [**security clearance five levels above top secret**](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=23721)

210,ryanderloewe,[],1640787669,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, considering the 340-letter cipher has been deciphered, I figured I would have a go cracking one of the unsolved ones.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, bear in mind before I get shredded, mocked and all of those wonderful ways which Redditors love to employ to not take it seriously, I had not really known of the suspects except for ALA and EVB and most certainly didn't see any pictures except for the former.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Before I reveal who I think it was, I will just mention that the profile of the guy and his history fits what was written in the ciphers like a hand into the glove.

&amp;#x200B;

When I saw the picture after working out the cipher, it couldn't be anybody else. There is a lot of speculation and just about everything fits. In the second cipher, we read some letters that didn't make sense, until now: NOSROV.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, indeed, there is a name in the 13-letter cipher and it follows two patterns: one is a misspelling and second is a repeated character. Now, we can't do any fancy sleuthing with this cipher such as reading or diagonally, but there is a method.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I actually think that whilst the cipher decoders have done a good job, I think people are applying logic of normal people and not looking at the logic of an abnormal person. The zodiac kille wanted to be identified and I think for him, there was no fancy cryptography device or code that needed to be used - just some theory about various types pf cryptography

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't used anything except trying to connect the dots and follow what is consistent rather than what is not.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried uploading the image of my notes , in order for you to see my conclusion and reasoning but can't upload it here.

&amp;#x200B;

I conclude the zodiac killer to be Ross Sullivan.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way I can upload the screenshot of my notes?

To illustrate my conclusion, I'll use a substitution for the text:

AEN@0K0M0LNAM

MYENAMEISROSS

&amp;#x200B;

Rearrange it

M0L|NAMA|EN|@0K0

MYE|NAME|IS|ROSS

&amp;#x200B;

The only first name I could think of that is only four letters but has a double letter is Ross.

We have a repeated zodiac letter.

We have the characteristic misspelling.

The method? Shift the letters forward and then rearrange some. I'm sure some people can take what I've got and explain the method in detail. You have to cross six letters and that's it.

Keep one letter the same after doing so, so we have:

M=M

L=Y

0=E

&amp;#x200B;

N=N

A=A

M=M

A=E

&amp;#x200B;

E=I

N=S

&amp;#x200B;

K=R

@=O

0=S

0=S

&amp;#x200B;

Taken from the zodiac wikia..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Evidence against Sullivan

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He was closely linked to the non-canonical Zodiac victim Cheri Jo Bates in 1966.

&amp;#x200B;

He was working at the campus and made people feel uneasy around him.

&amp;#x200B;

He did not show up for work after the Bates Murder and acted rather suspiciously. It is also said that he always wore the same outfit, After the murder he wore a completely new outfit.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn’t just look similar to the sketch; he looks exactly like it. I was shocked enormously at how precise his face is with the composite.

&amp;#x200B;

The same vocabulary and writing style was used in the Confession Letter and the Zodiac Letters.

&amp;#x200B;

People at Riverside have stated that Ross wrote creepy poems.

&amp;#x200B;

He wrote an essay on how to disguise handwriting.

&amp;#x200B;

He moved to Santa Cruz in 1968.

&amp;#x200B;

He died in 1977 which might explain why the murders stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

   In the decoding of the ""340-chiffre"" in Dec'2020 (see here is a strange erroneous code ""NOSRVS"" in the decoded text that could have been intentionally introduced by Sullivan as some sort of obfuscated ""Ross Sullivan"" acronym.[h](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1oQLPRE21o)here is a strange erroneous code ""NOSRVS"" in the decoded text that could have been intentionally introduced by Sullivan as some sort of obfuscated ""Ross Sullivan"" acronym.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'll get some stick and doubts for sure, but, hey-ho, that's part of the fun :)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, you guys be the judges.

&amp;#x200B;

211,sosotess,[],1640785108," In 2008, 20-year-old Jérôme mysteriously disappeared. Thirteen years later, bones were found next to the wreck of his car in a ravine, in southern France.

It was a hiker who randomly found the crashed vehicle in the hard to reach area in Sainte-Croix-du-Verdon, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. He then saw the remains and called the police. The car wasn't declared stolen back then although it wasn't registered to Jérôme.

His disappearance hadn't been reported back then. The orphaned young man lived with his uncle and aunt, and since he wasn't a minor anymore, no one thought to report him missing. His uncle did post a missing person notice on a website (www.personnedisparue.com) and the family apparently searched for him on their own. But there was never an official investigation. According to his relatives, Jérôme wasn't suicidal. He probably went off course in a hairpin curve before falling into the ravine. 

His death will most likely be ruled an accident. But at least, law enforcement is at last looking into it and the bones will be analyzed to confirm Jérôme's identity.

212,NoIdea2424,[],1640784408,"Was this ever solved? I come across this story every couple of years, I remember seeing it on the news. Anything come about the story? I would LOVE to know. Truly creepy.",The Watcher House
213,gaycatdetective,[],1640748605,"This post is about one victim and two other potential victims of William ""Felix"" Vail Sr., who will be referred to by his middle name, Felix. I will break it down into three sections, one dedicated to each woman. At the time of his conviction, he was considered the oldest **suspected** serial killer (he has never been charged in two of the cases.) Due to the gap in time between the murder and his arrest, this post will be slightly out of chronological order. 

**Mary Elizabeth Horton Vail**

Mary Horton married Felix Vail in July196. In 1962, Mary gave birth to a baby boy, and he was named after his father. (He will be referred to as Billy in this post.) Shortly after Billy's birth, Mary told her family the marriage was a mistake and she wanted to leave Felix. She changed her mind about leaving him, but just two months later she was dead.

According to Felix, on October 28, 1962, he and Mary were running trotlines at night on the Calcasieu River and she fell out of the boat when he swerved to avoid a stump. He was unable to save her.  Her body was found two days later with bruises on her head and neck and a scarf in her mouth. At the time of her death, Mary was just 22 years old and was pregnant with her second child.

Her death was initially ruled an accident, but authorities were suspicious of Felix's story for a number of reasons. The Charley Project states that not only was the portion of the river they were on not suitable for trotlines, but the trotlines had been left in his truck. Mary was also afraid of water, and Felix had traveled several miles downriver to allegedly get help, which would have wasted valuable time. Felix had two life insurance policies totaling $150,000 on Mary. (That would be about half a million in today's money.) One life insurance policy was taken out and paid in full shortly before Mary's death, around the same time she was telling family she had doubts about their marriage. Suspicions about Mary's death prevented him from collecting the full amount.

Felix was eventually arrested on murder charges, and the case was brought before a grand jury in January 1963 - just months after Mary's death. However, the charges were suddenly dropped and the case was closed before he could be indicted. The case would never make it to court and Felix was a free man for another fifty years.

On May 17, 2013, he was arrested for Mary's murder again. Photos of Mary's body when it was found had been re-examined, and a former neighbor of Felix's came forward with a chilling story of what he'd heard decades earlier:

*""He said, 'Well, that damn bitch wanted another baby … thought it might help save our marriage, but said I didn't want the one I got, and I sure didn't want another one.' … he said, 'I fixed that damn bitch. She won't never have another one.""*

Felix also told at least one other witness he had killed his wife, and described it in gruesome detail. He told another wife in the 1970s that he ""could have saved his first wife, but chose not to."" He was convicted of her murder in August 2016 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was upheld in November 2018.

**Sharon Hensley**

Sharon Hensley was from Bismarck, North Dakota but traveled to California. It is alleged that her family sent her to San Francisco to get an abortion and she was very upset about this and wanted to get away from her family. In the late 1960s or 1970, when she was about 18-21, she met and began dating Felix Vail. Felix had moved to California with his son Billy sometime after Mary's death and the charges against him had been dropped. Felix and Sharon hitchhiked around California with Billy in tow. In 1970, when Billy was eight years old, he went to the police and told them a disturbing story. He said his father had been forcing him to take drugs and that he had heard him telling Sharon about how he had killed Mary.

Felix was arrested at this time on drug and child abuse charges, and Billy was sent to live with his mother's family. Authorities from Louisiana tried to talk to Felix about Mary's murder at that time but he refused. A prosecutor declined to file murder charges against him at that time.

Sharon's brother saw a tabloid story about Billy in a supermarket. He had last seen his sister sometime around 1970, and at that time she seemed to be wasting away due to drugs and malnutrition. He believed Felix had total control over her, and that she was too scared to leave him. She fell out of contact with her family, but placed one last phone call to them in February 1973. During this phone call she said she and Felix were possibly traveling to South America.

A year after her last contact with family, they received a letter from Felix stating that he had not seen Sharon in about a year when they were in Key West, FL. According to Felix, she had burned all of her identification and said she wanted to disappear and start a new life. She then left with an Australian couple who were sailing the world. Felix initially said their names were John and Vanessa, but later changed his story and said their names were Frank and Sally.

Due to being out of contact with family, nobody knew Sharon was missing for a year, and was not officially reported missing for over 35 years. When Bill was 13, Felix showed back up in Mississippi without Sharon. He told Bill she would never bother anyone again, and at that time Bill knew she had been murdered. He believed that Felix blamed Sharon for Bill going to the police, and that was his ""excuse"" for killing her.

**Annette Marie Craver Vail**

Annette met Felix in Houston, Texas, when she was just 15 years old. After she graduated high school, they went on a cross country motorcycle trip. They married in 1983, when she was 17 years old and Felix was in his forties. After Annette turned 18, she inherited nearly $100,000 and two homes from her father's estate. (TCP states one of these homes was actually purchased from her mother with her inheritance money.)

A few months after they married, Annette left Felix and moved to Oklahoma to live with her mother. She said she'd had an abortion and wanted to divorce Felix. They reconciled a few weeks later, and Felix was named the sole owner of the home, and Annette's mother was asked to move out. Annette's inheritance money was used to pay off some of Felix's debt, but $41k was left in cash. A few weeks later, Annette disappeared.

She was last seen by her family on October 5, 1984 in Sulphur, Louisiana. Her mother reported her missing on October 22. Felix told neighbors she was visiting friends in Denver, Colorado. 

Felix told police she was mentally ill and had left on her own accord, and had boarded a bus at a Trailways bus station in St. Louis, Missouri bound for Mexico. (There was no Trailways bus station in St. Louis.) He said the last time he saw her, she did not have any false identification and was still using her given name. He also claimed she just wanted to get away from her mother. He said she had new friends who could get her a new identity, and had the $41k in cash with her when she left. He filed for divorce in December 1984.

Felix Vail has made various claims about having made contact with Annette since her disappearance, where she is, and searches he has made for her. None of these claims have ever been verified.

Annette's mother, Rose, never gave up searching for her. She hired private detectives and enlisted the help of a journalist. She learned about Mary's death and Sharon's disappearance and reached out to their families. She also reached out to Felix's family. Her relentless efforts eventually lead to prosecutor's re-examining Mary's death and he was eventually charged.

Felix Vail had at least seven wives. He was convicted in the murder of one, another disappeared, and was physically abusive to at least one other. His son, Bill, always believed he was guilty and made a video detailing everything he'd heard his father say about Mary's murder before his death in 2009. Felix has never been charged in any other disappearance or murder.

Apologies for any typos or grammatical errors, or if anything is unclear or incorrect. There was a lot of information to sort through, and some of it was conflicting.","Mary Horton Vail drowned in Louisiana in 1962. It took more than five decades to convict her then-husband of her murder. In that time, two other women connected to the man would mysteriously disappear. Where are Annette Michelle Craver Vail and Sharon Hensley?"
214,IndyHen,[],1640735538,"OK, I'm hoping this one is very solvable, because I truly believe the answer is out there and possibly could be found with deep enough digging in the right place, maybe on the Wayback Machine.

**A brief background**

The Indiana Glass Company operated out of Dunkirk, Indiana from 1907 to 2002.  During that time, they produced millions of pieces of glassware, which have become collectible today.  And perhaps no item they made is more prolific and collectible than the Glass Hen on Nest Covered Dish.

Indiana Glass Hens can be found in flea markets, antique stores, estate sales, and anywhere else where vintage items can be found.  The market is absolutely flooded with them.  Literally millions were made and sold during their heyday (mostly the 70s thru 90s.)  Today they have a very active collector's community, and you can see them selling every day on sites like ebay, etsy, mercari, and many others.

Different colors are more scarce than others, and fetch a higher price.  That being said, even the harder to find colors typically don't go for very much.  With one exception.

**The curious case of the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen**

Indiana Hen collectors are aware of an anomaly: there exists a Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen, which has odd traits, that is *exceptionally* scarce compared to the other colors.  Considered a ""Holy Grail"" item, they always fetch an absurd price on ebay, typically going for $1,000 or more.  People have described to me that they've collected these for 25+ years and never seen a cobalt in person.

**So, what's the mystery here?**

If all there was to this was being a hard to find item, it would require no further thought.  The true mystery here is that the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen is *different* than every other Indiana Glass Hen.  Author Shirley Smith describes this in her *Glass Hen on Nests Covered Dishes Identification Guide* book:

&gt; May or may not have circle on the back.  No small bumps on back end of comb.  Rumored to be slightly larger than other Indiana Hens

In addition to this, those lucky enough to find one have noted that it appears crudely made, and full of flaws.

It's well established in the community that these descriptions hold true.  [Here is a picture of one, with the differences highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/vft7qmf9otk61.png?width=857&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a40a0e69a5fe63f926539952ec13cab2fc8d9a5)

The mysterious thing here is that the Indiana Hen is a factory mass-produced item, made from a mold.  So every Indiana Glass hen is exactly the same, with only the Cobalt Blue one being different.

Mr. Bob Rawlings, the curator at the Indiana Glass Museum in Dunkirk, Indiana, and former factory chief at Indiana Glass has described the circle on the back of the Indiana Hen as being a ""valve mark.""  This was where the valve lifts the glass out of the mold, for an automatic takeout to collect the piece.  [Source](https://glassbottlemarks.com/indiana-glass-company-hen-on-nest-dishes/)

For the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen to *not* have that circle on the back, means at the very minimum it was made in a different manner than all the other hens.  It could also mean it was made by someone else altogether...

**Urban Legends Galore**

Over the years, sellers and collectors of the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen have told many tall tales to try to describe why it has these differences, and why it might be so scarce.

- It was hand made at the Indiana Glass Gift Shop, not using a machine, which is why it's more crude and full of flaws.

- Cobalt was a difficult color for Indiana Glass to make, so they ran it on a test machine with a lot of problems, then decided not to mass produce it

- Indiana Glass employees would make the hen on their own, unofficially

None of these explanations have ever been officially verified

**What do the experts say?**

Mr. Rawlings has been asked about the Cobalt Indiana Hen many times, and has said that he doesn't remember it being made there, and doesn't know where it came from.  However, this is basically word of mouth and I've never interviewed him personally, so that this one may be taken with a grain of salt.

Another expert--Craig Schenning--the author of the book *A Century of Indiana Glass* has recently written an extensive article about the Indiana Glass Hen.  In this article, he stated that after reviewing hundreds of pages of company catalogs, ads, and other source material, he found no proof that Indiana Glass Company made the Cobalt Blue Hen.  He speculated that it was a reproduction made overseas, possibly somewhere in Asia.

**Who made (or who sold) the Cobalt Blue Indiana Glass Hen**

I've spent countless hours trying to solve this mystery.  I've been able to verify that the Indiana Glass Resting Cat Dish was reproduced overseas in Cobalt Blue, and was sold in America.. distributed by AA Importing, and also found it in a catalog from Miles Kimball [here, pg. 7](https://media.mileskimball.com/images/mk_glassmailer.pdf)

The Indiana Glass Cat in Cobalt Blue is known among collectors to have had a ""Made in Taiwan"" sticker on the bottom.  Indiana Glass never made this item in Cobalt Blue.

The Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen is scarce, but it's not one-of-kind.  I know of around 10 or so people on different collectors groups who have one.  They've been found in the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and in Ontario, Canada.

I'm thinking they must've been sold at retail on store shelves at some point, or probably more likely, were featured in a mail order catalog.  Maybe it was even Miles Kimball, the same catalog that is today selling the Indiana Cat.  Maybe it could be in one of probably dozens of other catalogs over the years that would sell cheap trinkets.

**When did it enter the market?**

Shirley Smith's book says either 1920s or 1980s.  I'm aware of conversations about it on ebay's glass chat forum from the early 2000s (source: wayback machine)  1920s is an impossibility because the first Indiana Hen was made in 1935, and the striated nest that Cobalt appears in is from the 70s and later.  So 1980s seems more likely, but it may've appeared as late as the 90s or early 2000s.

So.. that's it.  There has to be some remnant of a catalog, or sales order, or receipt, or something.  Someone bought these from the primary market, somewhere, at some time.  Everyone I know who has one, says they bought it on the secondary market (thrift stores, estate sales, etc.)  If someone did buy it from the primary market, they're staying silent about it--possibly because the truth is it was made overseas and not by Indiana Glass.  The question is, how to find it?  Where to search, where to look?

I reached out to Miles Kimball with no reply, I reached out to the Sears Historic Society thinking it may've been in an old K-Mart Catalog, but no reply there either.

Sorry I'm brand new here and don't know which Flair fits this mystery best, so I'm using ""Request.""",The secret origin of the Cobalt Blue Indiana Glass Hen.
215,majowa2000,[],1640698821,"Back in February and March, I made a couple of videos detailing 19 John and Jane Doe cases that I believed would be solved by the DNA Doe Project this year. Since then, 5 of these cases have been publicly announced as solved (seems like I may have been a little optimistic!), while multiple cases outside of those predictions have been solved too. But as it turns out, some of these cases were actually solved long before I made those videos - Pulaski County Jane Doe, for example, was actually identified way back in 2019! For various reasons, some law enforcement agencies choose not to make these identifications public for months, or even years, so in 2022 it'll be worth bearing in mind that some of the announced solves were actually identified a very long time ago.

I'll keep posting updates about these cases as we enter 2022, where I hope that we'll see even more of these cases solved and the Does in question reunited with their names at long last. By an odd twist of fate, I'm now working for the DNA Doe Project, so I won't be able to make any predictions for 2022, but I'll still be closely tracking what happens to the 2021 cases (one of which I'm now working on!).

&amp;#x200B;

Below are the summaries for the solved DDP cases announced this year, along with links to YouTube videos about them. I've also included links to the original prediction posts and videos for anyone interested:

&amp;#x200B;

**Charlene Doe**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CytyQGAUAo**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CytyQGAUAo)

Case number 7 was Charlene Doe, a woman who was found murdered in Newton County, Indiana in 1988, and whose homicide remains unsolved to this day.

The Newton County Coroner’s Office has revealed that the woman had been identified as Jenifer Noreen Denton, who was 24 years old when she went missing. She had a 1 year old daughter at the time of her disappearance, and although her sister tried to file a missing person’s report back in 1988, the local police department refused on the grounds that Jenifer was an adult.

Though investigators had initially believed that Charlene Doe might be from Chicago, she was actually from the city of Joliet, Illinois, around 60 miles northwest of the area her body was found in. With her remains having been buried in a cemetery near the site where her body was found, she hasn’t been far from her hometown for the last 33 years, and now Jenifer’s family finally know what happened to her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kern County Jane Doe (1980)**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h39MFoTO9JA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h39MFoTO9JA)

Case #4 was Kern County Jane Doe, a woman whose body was found in Delano, California in 1980, after she was murdered by Wilson Chouest.

It's been announced that, after more than 40 years, Kern County Jane Doe has been identified as Shirley Ann Soosay. The DNA Doe Project’s belief that she was of indigenous Canadian ancestry turned out to be correct, as Soosay was originally from the community of Maskwacis in Alberta, Canada. The identification also solves the mystery of the ‘Shirley’ tattoo on the victim’s body – it turned out to be a tattoo of her own name.

It’s worth noting that this is believed to be the first time that a Doe from an indigenous background has ever been identified using forensic genealogy. The reasons for this are varied and complex, but the main issue is the under-representation of people of indigenous descent in the GEDmatch and FTDNA databases. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pulaski County Jane Doe**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D5aiaa3G5k&amp;t=0s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D5aiaa3G5k&amp;t=4s)

Case #5 was Pulaski County Jane Doe, a woman who was found murdered in Missouri in 1981, and whose killer has never been identified.

On the 40th anniversary of her body being found, it was announced that Pulaski County Jane Doe had been identified as Karen Kaye Knippers. Though DDP volunteers identified Knippers back in December 2019, this identification was not officially confirmed until recently when a DNA sample from a brother in Virginia was compared to her sample in CODIS.

Thanks to isotope testing, investigators had long believed that Pulaski County Jane Doe was originally from the Southeast of the United States, and this belief turned out to be correct – Knippers was originally from Florida. Despite this, she was living in Missouri at the time of her disappearance, and was last seen alive in St. Louis, around 130 miles east of the place where her body was discovered.

Knippers was 32 years old at the time of her murder, which is consistent with the predicted age range given after her body was found, but although it was initially thought that she might be of Native American or Hispanic descent, DNA testing showed that she was actually a European American.

Although the killer of Karen Knippers has not yet been caught, it is hoped that her identification will open up new lines of enquiry in the investigation into her murder.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marion County John Doe**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjWCHxDaqNY&amp;t=0s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjWCHxDaqNY&amp;t=0s)

Case #8 was Marion County John Doe, a man who was found murdered in Ohio in 1989 and whose homicide remains unsolved to this day.

It's been revealed that the DNA Doe Project has identified Marion County John Doe as John C. Kraicinski, who was 33 years old at the time of his death. Born on 22 September 1955, Kraicinski had previously been a resident of Galion, Ohio and went to visit his father there one day in July 1989. Upon leaving his father’s house, he was never seen again, and his family remained unaware of what had happened to him for over 30 years.

Unbeknownst to them, the body of a man had been found in a creek later that month, just 15 or so miles southwest of Galion. Kraicinski was known to have suffered from mental illness in the past, and had gone missing before only to get back in touch with his family months later, so they assumed that the same was true with this disappearance, with no one making the connection between the missing man and the body in the creek.

Meanwhile, investigators nicknamed the unidentified man ‘Luther’ as they set out to try and identify the remains. But as the decades passed, Luther remained nameless, leading detectives to turn to the DNA Doe Project in 2019 in an attempt to finally identify the mystery man. After the DNA Doe Project started working on the case, they quickly noticed that the man had a substantial amount of Eastern European ancestry, which proved to be a vital clue in solving the case. This lead allowed them to narrow in on John Kraicinski’s family before leading them to the man himself who, despite having never been formally reported missing, seemed to disappear from public records after 1989.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hudson John Doe**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooIxT6WnHXg&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooIxT6WnHXg&amp;t=1s)

Case #19 was Hudson John Doe, a man whose body was found in Ohio in 2019 and who was believed to have died at least 50 years prior to this discovery. 

Last month, it was revealed that the DNA Doe Project had identified this man as Richard Bunce, who was about 59 years old at the time of his death. Incredibly, Bunce had been born in New York State in 1793, and had died well over 150 years ago, around the year 1852.

When excavators discovered his body in a pine box back in 2019, reports emerged that people had been buried on the property in the mid-1800s. These rumours turned out to be true, as Bunce had previously lived on that land in the years before his death, with the 1850 census listing him as living there alongside his wife and their many children.

This was discovered after the DNA Doe Project took on the case, uploading the then unknown man’s DNA profile to GEDmatch. They found that he shared a substantial amount of DNA with one of his matches, and the match in question turned out to be Bunce’s great great great granddaughter. This is currently believed to be the oldest Doe case ever solved using investigative genetic genealogy, which proves that the technique is suitable for identifying people who died many decades, or even centuries, ago.

216,logicx24,[],1640696326,"The evening of February 24th, 1976 was like any other for Michelle Mitchell. The 19 year-old University of Nevada nursing student had spent the day in class, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, she was running a habitual errand—dropping a container of orange juice off to her father at a nearby bowling alley—before heading home. 

Just past 6 PM, Michelle was driving her Volkswagen Beetle east on 9th street, on the southern end of campus, when, as she passed Evans avenue, her engine seized and shut down, causing her car to roll impotently through the intersection. She used the car's accrued momentum to coast to the side of the road, and with the help of a passerby, pushed it into a nearby parking lot. 
Michelle then crossed the street to the university campus, walked into a phone booth, and called her mother, Barbara, to ask for a ride home.

When Barbara Mitchell arrived half an hour later, however, Michelle was nowhere to be seen. Barbara performed a cursory search of the area and found Michelle's Beetle, sitting in the parking lot Michelle had described, but couldn't find Michelle. With rising anxiety, she hurried back to the phone booth and called her husband and the police.

Barbara, her husband Edwin, and the police together spent hours combing over the entire campus and its surrounding neighborhoods searching for Michelle, but to no avail. The police brought a sniffer dog along, but an attempt to have it follow Michelle's scent from the phone booth led nowhere. As night officially set in, the police began to transition Michelle's disappearance into a larger missing-person investigation, with another search planned in the coming week.

Later that night, an elderly couple living at 333 E 9th Street, pulled into their driveway and triggered their garage door. As they watched the door open, their car's headlights began to illuminate the garage's interior, and they saw something unexpected: a human body. The startled couple rushed inside to investigate, and found the body of a partially-clothed woman, lying prostrate in a pool of drying blood, her hands bound behind her back with twine. Police were called, and as they turned the body over, they recognized the woman immediately. It was Michelle Mitchell.

The only major wound on Michelle’s body was a deep laceration across her neck, which was the source of the drying blood. She didn’t have any defensive wounds, which meant she may have been taken by surprise by her attacker, and the state of her body indicated she had been left in the garage for at least a few hours. This implied she had been murdered shortly after her car broke down on 9th street. Notably, an unknown cigarette butt was lifted from the scene, close to Michelle’s body, as were two shoe prints—about a man’s size 9 or 9.5—left in the dust of the garage. The murder weapon, however, was missing, as were Michelle’s car keys.

Witness sightings arrived quickly after the murder was publicized. Two witnesses reported that as a woman matching Michelle’s description walked towards the lot where she’d left her car, a man emerged and put his arms around her. Several others stated that they’d seen a man running away from the scene around the time the murder was thought to have occurred. Fraternity brothers at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house, which was a block from the murder scene on Evan’s Avenue, said they saw a man “walking away from the neighborhood in a hurry.” And most dramatically, a woman driving down 9th street said she almost hit a man who’d sprinted in front of her car. The woman said he had blood on him, and that was he holding one of his hands beneath his jacket.

With the multitude of information that arose in the first few weeks of the investigation, both police and Michelle’s family were optimistic the killer would be found quickly. But after the initial flurry of activity, the investigation ground to a halt. No other credible sightings of the unknown man were reported, nor were the sightings ever linked to a getaway vehicle. And as the years passed, the case went silent and then dormant. Michelle’s murder dropped off the back page of the *Sagebrush*, and the specter of her death receded from collective memory.

Cathy Woods had spent much of her life in psychiatric institutions. First diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at 12, Cathy’s childhood in Shreveport, Louisiana was troubled, marred by many delusions and psychotic breaks. She left school after fifth-grade, and after spending her teenage years enduring numerous treatments for schizophrenia, she decamped to Reno in 1969. In February 1976, Woods was the manager of a topless bar in downtown Reno, close to the university campus. She was working on February 24th.

Shortly after, however, Woods’ mental illness began to worsen again, and in early 1977 she moved back to Shreveport to be near family. In February of 1979, as her mental health deteriorated further, Woods was involuntarily committed to the Louisiana State University (LSU) Medical Center. 

Schizophrenia, which Woods suffered from, is a disorder that weaken patients’ abilities  to distinguish reality from delusion. Sufferers often experience hallucinations—typically, voices—and succumb to bouts of paranoia. Woods, in her plethora of hospital stays, was known to exhibit extreme paranoia, leading her to become convinced of many elaborate conspiracy theories. Her current stay was no different. Woods’ counselors noted that she’d claimed to be an FBI agent, that her mother was poisoning her, and fatefully, on the third day of her stay, that she’d “killed a girl named Michelle in Reno.”

Woods’ counselor, despite knowing about her lengthy history of false statements, decided to notify the police. The Shreveport police department called Reno, which, jubilant at this potential break in the case, sent a detective to the Louisiana to interview Woods. After the first interview, two more detectives flew down from Reno and interviewed Woods again, while Shreveport police obtained a warrant to search Woods’ mother’s house.

After two interviews, police came away with a confession which stated that Woods had led Michelle into the garage on 9th street after offering to fix her car, on the pretext of getting some tools. Woods then made a sexual proposal to Michelle, and when Michelle rebuffed her, Woods slashed Michelle’s throat.

But there were many irregularities with this confession. For one, the interviews were not recorded and the confession was never signed, so the veracity of the entire statement rested on the trustworthiness of the attendant officers. For another, Woods was never able to satisfactorily answer what she’d done with the murder weapon.

Moreover, even in the detectives’ written statement, Woods reported a number of incorrect details. Her description of Michelle’s car described it being a different model and having a different color, and her description of the knot used to bind Michelle was quite different. Additionally, counselors testified that before her interview, Woods had not responded to psychiatric medication and was unable to express her thoughts in a linear manner. Based on what transcripts remain of those interviews, then, it seems like police repeatedly asked Woods questions until she gave them the answers they wanted, slowly feeding her information until she regurgitated parts of it amongst what was a likely a long, incoherent ramble.

In 1980, Cathy Woods was extradited to Nevada, where she stood trial for the murder of Michelle Mitchell. The prosecution had no physical evidence, and Woods didn’t match any of the eyewitness accounts of a suspicious man fleeing down 9th street. Nor did they have a signed confession. But despite it all, Cathy Woods was sentenced to life in prison without parole, a result that was confirmed after a retrial in 1985. Two different juries rejected significant exonerating evidence because they believed there were no mitigating circumstances that would cause an innocent person to confess to a crime they did not commit.

For the next three decades, Woods would languish in prison, relapsing multiple times into bouts of psychosis and delusion. She would spend her lucid years loudly proclaiming her innocence, but her rudimentary education and struggles with writing prevented her from effectively petitioning the authorities. The few letters she was able to write fell on deaf ears. Finally, in early 2013, with the help of another inmate, Cathy wrote a letter to the Rocky Mountain Innocence Project, asking for a DNA test of the cigarette butt found at the scene. In August of 2013, the test was carried out.

The test finally vindicated Cathy Woods and her years of resistance. The DNA profile on the cigarette indicated the suspect was a caucasian male, similar to the original witness sightings. And when the DNA was uploaded to the FBI’s national database, investigators found a more surprising result. The DNA matched evidence left at the scenes of two other 1976 unsolved cases in California: the murders of Veronica Cascio and Paula Baxter, victims in the so-called Gypsy Hill Killings.

---

On January 7th, 1976, eighteen year-old Veronica Ann Cascio was waiting at a bus stop on Bradford Way and Fairway Drive in Pacifica, a beachside town in San Mateo County, California. The Skyline College student was heading to campus for the day, and as she was attending a friend’s birthday party that evening, her family wasn’t worried when she didn’t come home that night. The next day, a high school student walking home for lunch spotted Veronica’s body lying face down in a creek at Sharp Park Golf Course, less than a quarter mile from where she was last seen alive. She had been stabbed over thirty times, and an autopsy revealed she’d been sexually assaulted. 

Two weeks later, on January 24th, Tanya Blackwell, a fourteen year old high school student in Pacifica, left her home on Heathcliff drive to walk to a 7-11 a mile away. She never returned, and after a few hours of fruitless searching, her parents reported her missing. No other evidence of Tanya was found, however, and she remained a missing person for six months.  Finally, on June 6th, her body was discovered off of Gypsy Hill Road in Pacifica, a few miles from her home. Like Veronica, Tanya had been stabbed over 20 times, and her body was found less than a mile from where Veronica’s was. The similarity in M.O, location, and ages of the victims led police to immediately link the cases, and the distinctive name of the street she was found on gave the murders their popular moniker: the Gypsy Hill Killings.

On February 4th, eight days after Tanya’s disappearance, seventeen year old Paula Louise Baxter went missing after leaving Capuchino high school in San Bruno, a few miles east of Pacifica. The next morning, her station wagon was found on a nearby residential street, with its wheels, undercarriage, and driver’s seat spattered with blood. Her body was found next to a Mormon Church less than a block from the high school. Baxter had been sexually assaulted, stabbed four times, and had her head bashed in with a concrete block. Since hers was the second body found, the obvious similarities to the Cascio case made police broaden their search to a serial offender.

The murderer then temporarily went quiet in the Bay Area, but the DNA link indicated that he went to Reno around February 24th to kill Michelle Mitchell. About two weeks after that, on March 15th, Carol Lee Booth went missing in South San Francisco. She was walking home from a bus stop at El Camino Real and Arroyo Drive, taking a shortcut through (what used to be) a heavily wooded area by the Kaiser hospital, when she was dragged into the bushes and murdered. Her body was found two months later in a shallow grave on Grand Avenue, near Colma Creek. She had also been stabbed repeatedly. The level of decomposition, however, made it impossible to determine if she had been sexually assaulted.

The final murder officially connected to the Gypsy Hill killings was that of Denise Lampe on April 1st. Denise was last seen walking towards her car in the Serramonte Shopping Center in Daly City, intending to meet a friend later that evening. She never made it, however, and at 10 PM that night, a mall security guard came upon her body, slumped over the front seat of her car. 

Like the other murdered women, Lampe had also been stabbed to death, and her murder occurred within the same Daly City-South San Francisco-Pacifica triangle that the killer was familiar with. Unlike the other women, however, Lampe was not sexually assaulted, and her murder occurred in a crowded shopping center, not on a quiet residential street. These differences made the connection to the Gypsy Hill murders more tenuous, and while police investigated the killing as part of a serial offense, many observers believed it may be unrelated. 

There is one more murder often included as part of the Gypsy Hill Killings: the March 17th, 1976 killing of Idell M. Friedman (just two days after Carol Booth’s murder). Friedman was killed in her home on 116 Fairmount Street in the Glen Park neighborhood of San Francisco. In Friedman’s case, however, the connection is even more tenuous. Friedman was the only victim killed in her home, unlike most of the others, who were abducted while outside. She was partially strangled with a lamp cord before being stabbed just once, which again differs from the previous victims’ multitude of stab wounds. Friedman was also sexually assaulted, but her home had been ransacked, indicating the crime may have been motivated by robbery. 

Regardless, after the murder of Denise Lampe, the killer went entirely silent in the San Francisco Bay Area and Reno, with no other murders bearing his imprint surfacing. Police theorized he either moved elsewhere or was imprisoned on unrelated charges. And as the murders stopped, so too did the investigation. All of the murders had few witnesses and little useable physical evidence. There weren’t any fingerprints left behind anywhere, and while there was unknown DNA found, the technology available in 1976 wasn’t able to analyze it. A massive investigation, one of the largest in San Mateo history, was downsized to just a few detectives, and then to none. DNA samples for the Veronica Cascio, Paula Baxter, Denise Lampe, and Idell Friedman cases were stored for posterity, but for Carol Booth and Tanya Blackwell, whose bodies weren’t discovered until months after their murders, no viable samples existed.

In 2013, the cases were all reopened after the connection to Michelle Mitchell was discovered. But detectives still weren’t optimistic about a resolution. It had been almost four decades since the murders. The few witnesses’ memories had faded, many of the victims’ families had passed away, and many of the crime scenes had been developed over. In the early months of 2014, the case looked set to go cold again. 

But then, police got lucky.

---

In late 2014, a prisoner serving a life sentence in a Nevada prison was paroled, leading to his immediate extradition to Oregon to serve a separate fifteen year sentence. In Oregon, it was mandatory for all inmates in state prisons to register their DNA with national authorities, but when the prisoner had been admitted to the Nevada prison, no such law existed. And so, when the prisoner’s DNA was uploaded to the national database, almost twenty-five years after he first entered the correctional system, there was an unexpected result. The prisoner’s DNA matched semen found on Veronica Cascio and Paula Baxter’s bodies, and to the cigarette butt left by Michelle Mitchell’s body. The deeply incriminating find proved one thing beyond doubt: Rodney Lynn Halbower was the Gypsy Hill Murderer.

Rodney Halbower was a lifelong criminal. By his own account, his first arrest was at age nine, when he smashed all the windows of a house in his hometown of Muskegon, Michigan. His first stint in juvenile prison came in 1963, when, aged fifteen, he stole a car and crashed it. He was released on parole, but was quickly rearrested after an attempted robbery. Before he could be sentenced, however, he escaped. He was recaptured within weeks and sentenced to five years in prison.

This pattern—arrest, escape, rearrest—would be the recurring cycle of Halbower’s life. In 1970 he was released from prison, but was arrested again shortly after for theft. He was given a four year term, but escaped, and while on the run, he fathered his only child. Halbower was then again captured, and after completing his sentence, he was released in 1975. After his release, he moved from Michigan to Nevada, settling in downtown Reno. In December of 1975, he raped and assaulted a blackjack dealer in Reno. The victim survived and identified Halbower, who was again arrested but was released on bail. 

Halbower would remain at large until May of 1976, when he was convicted for the rape and assault and sentenced to life in prison. It was in this five month window that Halbower went on his killing spree, murdering, at the very least, Veronica Cascio, Paula Baxter, and Michelle Mitchell.

In June 1977, Halbower escaped from prison again, and though he made the FBI’s “Most Wanted” list, he managed to elude capture until July, where he was found in Muskegon attempting to kidnap his daughter. Halbower was returned to prison, where he stayed until he successfully escaped again in December. He was again recaptured and remained in prison for another eight years.

In 1986, Halbower escaped his maximum-security prison in Nevada, and this time, he stole a car and drove to Oregon. In Jackson, Oregon, he raped and attempted to murder a woman. The victim again survived the attack, and quickly identified Halbower as her attacker. In March 1987, Halbower was sentenced to 15 years-to-life in Oregon. He was then extradited back to Nevada to complete his original sentence, and when he was paroled in 2013, he was returned to Oregon. This transfer led to his DNA being taken, and it was the reason investigators were able to trace him back to the Gypsy Hill Killings. If Halbower had never escaped prison in 1986, the murders probably would have remained unsolved.

Halbower did not, however, match DNA found on Denise Lampe’s body, proving definitively that her murder was not linked to the Gypsy Hill Killings. Instead, in 2017, a blood stain on Lampe’s jacket was matched to Leon Melvin Seymour, an inmate at Coalinga State Hospital, and, like Halbower, a convicted sex offender who had spent long stints in prison. Halbower also did not match DNA left on Idell Friedman’s body, whose murder remains unsolved. The confirmation that both Denise Lampe and Idell Friedman were not victims of the Gypsy Hill Killer, despite the striking temporal proximity of their deaths, should be a cautionary tale for those searching for patterns across potentially unrelated deaths.

In September 2018, a jury in San Mateo deliberated for just one hour and fifteen minutes before finding Rodney Halbower guilty of the murders of Veronica Cascio and Paula Baxter. The bulwark of the prosecution’s case was the DNA, which the district attorney called “incontrovertible.” Halbower was sentenced to two life sentences, one for each murder. Currently, he is awaiting extradition to Nevada to stand trial for the murder of Michelle Mitchell. 

The murders of Tanya Blackwell, Carol Booth, and Idell Friedman remain unsolved. Police believe Blackwell and Booth were also Halbower’s victims, but he has denied any involvement, and the lack of DNA makes it impossible to lay charges. These murders will remain officially unsolved, but at least their families will have some closure. 

Idell Friedman’s case, on the other hand, has not progressed since 1976. The police have no suspects, no motives, and no witness sightings, leaving the case in a decades-long purgatory. Friedman’s death in 1976 overlapped with the California serial killer boom, leading many online sleuths to try to link her case to the Zodiac Killer and the Golden State Killer. Most likely, however, her death is entirely unrelated to these serial offenders, and it will not be resolved unless there’s a serendipitous DNA match.

The arc of Cathy Woods’ life did eventually bend towards justice, but it took an excruciatingly long time. From her initial imprisonment in 1980 to her final release in February of 2015, Woods spent thirty-five years in prison—the longest sentence a wrongfully convicted woman has served. She entered prison as a troubled but optimistic twenty-five year old, recovering from a mental relapse, but left as a grizzled senior citizen, bearing the loss of her middle age in the creases lining her brow.

After her release, she first moved to southern California to stay with family, before making a trip to Shreveport to see her 92-year-old mother for the first time in three decades. She then moved to an assisted living facility in Washington, where, in August of 2021, aged just 72, she passed away. 

Woods’ passing is a tragic coda to the story of the Gypsy Hill Killings, and the vapidity of her ordeal highlights the shortcomings of our justice system. A jury of one’s peers is still colored by the prejudices of those peers, by the stereotypes and implicit biases that govern their judgement. Cathy Woods was convicted because she was mentally ill in an era that considered psychosis a personal fault, and confessed to lesbianism in an era that viewed homosexuality as a deathly sin. The miscarriage of justice that followed is a symptom of that inherent flaw.

Years later, when asked why Cathy confessed to crime she did not commit, her lawyer said, “I'm told it was a product of wanting to get a private room. She was being told she wasn't sufficiently dangerous to qualify, and within a short period she was claiming she had killed a woman in Reno.”

217,Ok-Explorer496,[],1640661093,"I'm sorry if I'm doing something wrong. This is my first experience in creating a post. I recently got acquainted with the NFT technology at a basic level and thought that Cicada could use this technology to authenticate their messages + this could solve their problem with the PGP key, since I heard that it was compromised or stolen (sorry if I wrote some nonsense, I'm doing cryptography and studying the mysteries of Cicada 3301 as a hobby and haven't delved deep enough yet).

At some point, I thought, what if Cicada has already posted its riddles or messages on one of the NFT platforms. I started googling NFT marketplace. I started with the most famous Binance, Rarible, OpenSea... Unfortunately, the search for the phrase Cicada 3301 on these sites did not lead to anything useful, only to a bunch of repeating pictures from the first riddle and to the people who collected it and I gave up.

After a while, I thought, what if I was looking for the wrong thing. Perhaps Cicada saw a huge number of users with different variations of Cicada logins and decided to use something that could highlight their account. I decided that their nickname should be some kind of cipher, but the decryption should also lie on the surface, because it is almost impossible to guess a complex cipher without some introductory words.

I started playing with the Cicada3301 login. One of the first ciphers that cicada used was the Caesar cipher. Maybe it's stupid, but the first thing that occurred to me was to encrypt Cicada with this cipher with an offset of 3301. It turned out: Bhbzcz. I started looking for accounts with this nickname on the same NFT sites. Success! There is a strange account on Rarible with one item ""Second"". [https://rarible.com/bhbzcz](https://rarible.com/bhbzcz) Assuming that the First is an account avatar, I downloaded it and immediately got into the hex editor.

Failure again. There was nothing encrypted in the picture. But I paid attention to its size, most likely Rarible deliberately compresses the avatar to the size it needs, as many other sites do. Therefore, the encrypted message could be lost during compression. My task was to find the original image. (I note that the avatar itself is drawn in pencil, and I have not seen anything like this before in the Cicada 3301 riddles). I used Google image search, but it didn't lead me to the original.

After some more time, I noticed that there are two types of display of the user's avatar on the site, two different sizes. After opening the links to both options, I noticed that they both have the same ID. You only need to choose the right URL for the original image format.

The first 30 minutes of selecting the URL did not lead to anything, and I gave up this idea.

I decided to try a different approach and registered my account on Rarible to see if the account owner could get a link to the original image of his avatar, and bingo, it worked. It turns out that the sources locate on a completely different domain ([https://ipfs.rarible.com/ipfs/](https://ipfs.rarible.com/ipfs/)), but their ID matches.

The gunmen then shot all seven victims multiple times at point-blank range.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-CNN-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-FoxNews-2) They then set the office on fire by igniting some papers before leaving the alley.

The bowling alley fire was reported at 8:33 am. Officers responding to the call discovered that Amy Houser, Paula Holguin, and Steven Teran had died at the scene. Valerie Teran was rushed to a hospital, but declared dead on arrival.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-3) Repass, despite being shot five times, called [9-1-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1) on the office phone, allowing emergency services to respond immediately and saving her life along with her mother's and Ida Holguin's.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-4) However, Senac died in 1999 due to complications from her injuries.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-lcsun-5)

Police set up ten roadblocks surrounding Las Cruces within an hour of the shooting, and carefully screened anyone leaving the city.

According to aforementioned article:

“Podraza told Dateline in an email last week that the materials included the apartment building surveillance video, the declarations of two building employees, and the videotaped depositions of Drs. Gulino, Osbourne and Emery of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office. It was Dr. Emery, a pathologist in the Medical Examiner’s Office in 2019 trained in neuropathology, who previously testified that a specimen of Ellen’s cervical spine retained from the original autopsy contained one of Ellen’s stab wounds.

“According to Dr. Emery, the preserved wound Emery examined in 2019 was administered when Ellen had no pulse – she was already dead,” Podraza said.

He went on to explain that “this wound was not the last stab wound Ellen sustained because a knife was found embedded in Ellen’s chest when emergency personnel arrived on the scene.”

“We remain dumbfounded about how a person could self-inflict at least two separate stab wounds when dead,” he added.”

i found this phone call a few years ago, and something about it always made me think about it again from time to time. probably because it is really chilling, but also because of the fact that i just don’t know where the hell the source of it is. it could be fake honestly, but i’m not sure.

it involves a woman named sharon who’s hiding inside her home with her baby. man tries to break into her house, so she calls 911, frantic and clearly panicking. soon enough, he breaks in, and she screams to him, “i have the police on the phone!” before the screams become her pleading, “why are you here? why? why?” she screams, the phone hangs up, and that’s it.

i’ve heard people say she got murdered, others say she got raped, but i’ve been trying to do some digging as to what happened, and i can’t find anything. part of me thinks it’s probably fake because of the lack of source, but i’m not sure. if it’s real, i hope she’s alright! :(

if anyone knows the outcome plus a credible source along with it, please share!! thank you!!

221,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1640623598,"On the morning of June 29th, 1989, government employees at The Wayne Township Trustees in Fort Wayne, Indiana made several attempts to contact their fellow coworker, 31-year-old Dawn (Maxwell) Cotton, when she failed to show up for work that day. Dawn was employed at the offices as a typist/clerk, and was known as being extremely punctual. So when coworkers' attempts to reach Dawn by phone failed, they decided to go to her apartment to check on her. 

Dawn lived alone on the first floor of a modest, 1-bedroom, duplex style apartment located at 1319 West Jefferson Street in Fort Wayne. After knocking and receiving no answer, Dawn’s coworkers entered the apartment only to be met with a nightmarish scene; Dawn’s lifeless body lay sprawled across her bed, riddled with stab wounds. 

An autopsy would determine that Dawn had been stabbed more than 30 times in the chest, her heart had been punctured, and her throat had been slit. The coroner found no evidence of defensive wounds on Dawn’s body, leading him to believe she was most likely attacked while asleep. It was also concluded Dawn had not been sexually assaulted. Her ultimate cause of death was listed as blood loss. 

No evidence was found in Dawn’s home that would indicate it had been burglarized. Aside from the gruesome scene in her bedroom, Dawn’s apartment seemed to be completely untouched, nothing appeared to be missing, and there were no signs of forced entry into the home. The weapon used to murder Dawn, was not located. 

Investigators began by questioning neighbors. Unfortunately, aside from several reports of seeing “strangers” in the area in previous days, no one reported seeing or hearing anything suspicious around the time of Dawn’s murder. Dawn’s coworkers were of little assistance either, stating they had no idea why anyone would want to hurt her. After interviews with Dawn’s family and friends produced no leads, law enforcement turned to Crime Stoppers in the hopes someone would come forward with information. Sadly, they never received a single tip. 

Dawn had been married once to a man named Anthony Cotton, however the pair had divorced several years prior and had no ongoing relationship of any kind. Anthony was questioned, but was quickly ruled out as a suspect. 

With little evidence, no motive, and no suspects, Dawn’s case quickly went cold. However, in what some would consider nothing more than a bizarre coincidence, less than a year after Dawn’s murder a second employee of The Wayne Township Trustees would be brutally stabbed to death. 

On April 27th, 1990, 65-year-old Dorothy Klug was found stabbed to death in her home after her coworkers reported that she had failed to come into work that day. Like Dawn, Dorothy had been stabbed more than 30 times. 

However, unlike Dawn’s case, an arrest came almost immediately. 33-year-old Latanya Robinson, a coworker of Dorothy’s at The Wayne Township Trustees, was arrested the same day after she was witnessed driving Dorothy’s vehicle. 

It was learned that Latanya and a male friend had borrowed money from Dorothy earlier in the evening to purchase drugs with. After using the money and getting high, the pair returned to Dorothy’s home around 3am to borrow more. According to the male friend, he waited in the car for a while but grew impatient. When he approached the home, he heard a woman scream and saw Latanya standing over Dorothy with a pair of scissors, covered in blood through a window. 

Latanya admitted killing Dorothy in a drug fueled rage when Dorothy refused to give her more money after learning she had used the previous money for drugs. She was found guilty of felony murder and two counts of robbery. However, while investigators commented on the similarities of the two slayings, they were never proven to be related. 

That same year, James Winters, yet another member of The Wayne Township Trustees, would be arrested on charges of theft, mismanagement of funds, and official misconduct. James, along with eight other township employees were accused of participating in a kickback scheme involving funds from the towns “poor-relief funds.” 

Rumors swirled that Dawn’s murder was the result of her discovering the misuse of funds, however investigators found no evidence indicating that Dawn was aware of any of the illegal activities occurring at her workplace. 

32 years later, Dawn’s case remains unsolved.

222,justiceforlenora,[],1640609263,"On February 15, 1953 Lenora Seiler was dropped off by her father at the local movie theater in Valley Park, Missouri. When her father came to pick her up later that evening, she was gone. What happened between when Lenora left the theater and her body was found a month later is unclear and still remains a mystery to date.

What is known for sure is the following: Lenora began walking home alone after the movie ended earlier than expected. Her parents recalled hearing a car door slam and a scream from an unknown individual they thought was Lenora near their home sometime that evening. Their fear, like everybody else’s, was that somebody had abducted the quiet, 13-year-old girl. Police, as was the norm of the time, believed her to be a runaway until she failed to return home after several days. The shift then began to focus from her just running away to foul play. Lenora’s community kept their hopes up for a safe return, holding vigils, praying, lighting candles, and searching for the girl. The employer of her father offered a $1,000 reward (equivalent to over $10,000 today).

The town’s hopes were crushed on March 14, 1953 when Lenora’s body was found in the Meramec River. None of Lenora’s clothes or belongings were found with the body and the coroner believed that the body may have been buried in the river but washed away. Popcorn found in her stomach indicated that Lenora likely died within five hours of her disappearance. No signs of assault were found on the body and a definitive cause of death was not able to be determined, but the coroner thought that asphyxiation was likely. Police believed it was a homicide and ruled it as so. Like the town’s hopes, Lenora’s story began to fade with time. Her church’s baptismal fountain was dedicated in honor of her in July of that year.

No leads or tips surfaced in the case until 1958, when a 22-year-old man, named Denver Darrell Morris, confessed to killing Lenora. Police believed his statements to be credible, but his aunt and uncle later told police that he was mentally ill. Morris later recanted his confession to the crime and a lie detector test cleared him of any involvement. Due to the time that has passed, Lenora’s case was closed and it remains unsolved.

Let’s break it down…

*Barney &amp; Betty Hill*

In the December 1974 issue of Astronomy, the then-editors published a lead feature story titled “The Zeta Reticuli Incident.” 

This feature described the so-called Betty and Barney Hill story, in which a New Hampshire couple claimed to have been abducted in 1961 and taken aboard an alien spacecraft. 

Betty Hill famously drew a star map from memory, in 1964, under psychoanalysis. The map supposedly showed the sky as seen from a planet orbiting the star Zeta Reticuli, from which the alien abductors had arrived.

https://astronomy.com/bonus/zeta

*Bob Lazar*

Lazar claims to have been hired in the late 1980s to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial technology at what he described as a secret site called ""S-4"". Lazar alleges that this subsidiary installation is located several kilometers south of the United States Air Force facility popularly known as Area 51.

From Lazar’s appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience:

“There was some paperwork that indicated that this [UFO] was from the Zeta Reticuli star system. How they obtained that, I haven’t the slightest idea. It wasn’t just from the Zeta Reticuli star system, it was what they called ZR3. It was the third planet in that star system. There was no other information about it, other than that’s supposedly where the craft came from.”

Even the way he says ""girls"" has the same tone and authority I remember my old teachers having. Obviously we don't know what's on the rest of the video, and if the killer was known to the girls they would probably have addressed him by name, so that's a big flaw in my theory, but maybe the rest of the recording is too low quality to hear a name.

I also think an intruder or family friend is responsible for JonBenet Ramsey's death. People say 'why leave her body in the house?' but it's certainly easier than transporting and hiding the body. There is very sadly evidence of previous abuse and there seemed to be people in and out of that house all the time. I don't believe the family could have kept this a secret for all these years if it was a giant cover up.

226,angeliswastaken,[],1640563055,"Jennifer Marteliz is someone close to me, who was abducted in 1982 when she was 7 years old. She would be 46 years old today. I want to put the spotlight on her as I continue to see case after case being solved through new developments in technology. 

Jennifer was last seen walking home from school. She was one block from her family's residence on 15th Street and 109th Avenue in Tampa, Florida on November 15, 1982 at approximately 3:00 p.m. Jennifer asked a friend to watch her as she continued to her house; her friend turned away for a moment and Jennifer disappeared. She has not been seen again. All family members were cleared by authorities of involvement in her disappearance. 

Authorities suspected that Thomas Peter Welnicki, a family friend of Jennifer with an extensive criminal history for charges ranging from theft to drug possession to minor assault, was involved in her case. A photograph of Welnicki is posted with this case summary.

When questioned by police, he claimed to have a psychic vision of Jennifer's abduction and murder. He said she was abducted and strangled by two men. One of them, he said, was in his forties and had a criminal history, and the other was a blond man in his mid-twenties whom Jennifer knew and trusted, and whose conscience troubled him deeply after the child's death. Welnicki himself matches the description of the blond man.

Authorities believe Welnicki's ""vision"" was actually a confession, but he denies this. He failed a polygraph about Jennifer's case, but this may have been because he was taking medication to prevent seizures. Welnicki he has never been charged in connection with Jennifer's case. I haven't been able to locate any viable information on him in many years. 

There have been multiple leads regarding remains located in the area of Jennifer's disappearance. Her family has submitted DNA but none have proven fruitful. In 2012 there was a lead which many of us felt was promising; a young woman reported her suspicion that her neighbor who lived on the same block as Jennifer at the time of her disappearance might be involved. This was a credible report, and Law Enforcement obtained warrants and searched multiple properties, but ultimately it did not produce any hard evidence.

She has a large family and community of friends who love her, and have prayed every day for her return. Some of these people have already passed away, never knowing what happened to her.

227,ChicTurker,[],1640551591,"Just a little over two miles from my house in Little Rock, Arkansas -- and even closer to the house of [Jennings Osborne](https://allears.net/2020/11/22/the-complete-history-of-the-osborne-family-spectacle-of-dancing-lights/), so a ""good"" area of a city that was divided by redlining (leading to houses never getting valued properly/continuing to be devalued in other areas of the city) -- a woman and her dog made a shocking discovery.

A woman's body had been placed behind an abandoned house, apparently hastily covered with construction materials or leftover demolition debris laying around the rear of the home.  She had been shot.  

Her clothing was male-branded, but that could have been more necessity than choice -- and she was dressed for winter, suggesting that whoever killed her did not do it in August.  The status of the remains seem to suggest that as well, though postmortem intervals are difficult to determine.  The only jewelry photographed was a bracelet, clearly weathered in the photos.  She had a discernable gap in her front teeth in death, may have been covered by gums in life enough not to be discernable.

The [initial reconstruction](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/517ufar.html) of her was awful and if her family didn't recognize her from it, I can't blame then.  Her recent reconstructions definitely are more realistic-looking, though her new reconstruction makes her look more like [Minnie Taylor[(https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/9984/details) (a possibility considered by sleuthers but she disappeared in May of 2002 when 70 feels hot, not cold -- and they may have dentals on her that rule out Taylor as a match.  She is not a ruleout on NamUS as of yet, but I believe that the Doe Network PM panel has reviewed this in the past -- if someone wants to submit it to them again, though, the LRPD may be accepting any leads now that they put money into a better reconstruction.

-------

This area is also close to I-40 by distance -- though only a killer familiar with Little Rock (or wanting her found there) would go off of I-40 on I-430 towards Little Rock, take the first exit off it and head towards downtown instead of out of town, then turn down the first seemingly quiet street.  

Anyone knowing Little Rock well enough to know how many churches existed on the northern part of Reservoir Road (2772 seems an input error, 2722 is an address though that had property taxes paid in the past) but already on the Interstate would likely know a better place to dump a body.

There was (and still is) a ""rent by the week"" studio apartment complex on the lower end of Reservoir Road, but that would point to a visitor IMHO, not an on-the-lease resident, being the killer (too close to where records said your home was).  She could have also been a visitor or a guest, though also potentially a leasing resident at any of the apartment complexes in the area -- if she had no close family to report her missing, her landlord could have assumed she abandoned the lease.

However, I DO think she was killed somewhere nearby where she was discovered -- mostly because someone driving far in that area with a body in their car would feel very uncomfortable.  They might have used the freeway just to avoid cops and came from a different area of the city/county through the freeway route I mentioned, figuring they were safer if they were doing the limit, but they would still have to know Little Rock fairly well to know even know where this location was to dump the body there and by that route avoid being on city streets w/ a body in the trunk -- without resorting to just going further down the freeway into a rural part of the state where she may never have been found at all.

(The timeline for this Doe does not match the Samuel Little confessions.)

Save for a single appearance in August 2007, she has been in deep isolation for over 15 years.

Tony Ortega's website, which reports on Scientology through documents, leaks, and interviews with former cult members, is the source for most of this information. Links to sources at the end!!!

**Shelly's Disappearance: A Timeline**

* January 18, 1961: Michele ""Shelly"" Barnett born
* 1970s: as a young teen, Shelly joins the Commodore's Messenger Org (CMO), working closely with L. Ron Hubbard. This Scientology in-group later evolves into the Sea Org.
* 1982: Shelly marries fellow CMO member David Miscavige
* 1986: L. Ron Hubbard dies and David Miscavige assumes control of the cult
* 1990s: the Miscaviges move to the Scientology compound known as ""Int Base"" or ""Gold Base,"" located in the desert in Riverside County, California. Their legal address, however, is one of Scientology's properties on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.
* 1980s-2000s: Shelly acts as an assistant to her husband in his role of leading (aka micro-managing) Scientology. According to some former members, she helped ""audition"" actresses to be Tom Cruise's girlfriend when he was single in the early 2000s.
* circa 2004: Growing more abusive and controlling, David Miscavige creates a place called ""the Hole"" on Int Base, to imprison and punish his staff who displease him. Tensions in the Miscavige marriage; David spends too much time with his ""personal communicator"" Laurisse ""Lou"" Henley-Smith, and Shelly suspects them of an affair. According to Valerie Haney, who was the Miscaviges' assistant and Shelly's personal friend, David and Lou were not in a sexual relationship at that time. 
* summer 2004: at a party in Tom Cruise's honor on Scientology's cruise ship, David and Shelly fight and he denigrates her in public. 
* summer 2005: David Miscavige leaves Int Base to work in Los Angeles, leaving Shelly behind. Normally, they would travel together, so their relationship is apparently hanging by a thread. At one point, Shelly corners Scientology executive Mike Rinder, who had just returned to the base from working with David in LA. She asks him if David was wearing his gold or his platinum wedding ring. Rinder believes this odd question was her way of trying to find out if David was even wearing a ring while they were separated. He tells her he didn't notice. 
* still summer '05: In David's absence, Shelly ""fills in an org board,"" which is Scientology jargon for shifting some people's jobs around. When David returns, he erupts in anger. He goes back to LA, and Shelly follows him desperately in a car. ""She drove down and then she came right back,"" said Valerie Haney.
* maybe one week later: Shelly boxes up some of her and David's stuff and puts it into storage, in preparation for a renovation of their quarters. According to witnesses, both this and the org board thing were tasks that David had been talking about doing for a long time. Perhaps Shelly was trying to get on his good side by taking care of them? If so, it backfired horribly both times.
* one day later: **Shelly is gone.** She is not in ""the Hole,"" as many people think; the Hole is on Int Base, and Shelly is removed from the base altogether. She is believed to be taken to a smaller Scientology compound in the mountains east of Los Angeles (it has a lot of names, but I'll call it Twin Peaks), and to still be there to this day.
* November 2006: Tom Cruise marries Katie Holmes, and David Miscavige is the best man at the wedding, which is a Scientology ceremony. Actress Leah Remini, a Scientologist, is a wedding guest and wonders where Shelly is (David's date for the wedding is his ""communicator,"" Lou). Asking around to other guests, Remini is told by high-ranking executive Tommy Davis, ""You don't have the fucking rank to ask about that."" However, Scientology has strict rules about not stepping out on one's partner, and also has a structure encouraging snitching. Leah Remini writes a ""Knowledge Report"" on the leader of her church for his ""crimes."" In response, she is punished and forced to rescind her reports on Miscavige.
* summer 2007: Shelly Miscavige's father dies, and she makes a brief appearance at his funeral, accompanied at all times by a handler. **Last ever public sighting of Shelly.**
* July-August 2013: Leah Remini manages to extricate herself from the cult. One of her first actions is to file a missing persons report on Shelly Miscavige, who at this point has been out of sight for eight years. She files it with the LAPD because the Miscaviges' legal address is still that building on Hollywood Boulevard. Journalist Tony Ortega breaks down what happened next: August 5- Leah files the report. August 8- Tony breaks the news of what she did on his website. Same day- reporters calling the LAPD for comment on Tony's story are told the missing persons report is ""unfounded."" A detective has allegedly visited Shelly, talked to her, and confirmed she is not missing. Wherever she is, she says she's there voluntarily. Leah Remini never hears back from the LAPD herself.
* December 2016: an anonymous witness in the mountain town of Crestline, the closest town to the ""Twin Peaks"" compound, reports seeing a ""frail"" and disheveled woman accompanied by two male handlers on two occasions in 2015 and early 2016. She believes the woman may have been Shelly Miscavige, then 55.
* also December 2016: Through a records request to the LAPD, Leah Remini seeks specific documents to answer why the case on Shelly Miscavige was closed so quickly, which detectives spoke to her, and why she (Leah) never heard back. All her requests are denied.
* still Dec. 2016: Tony Ortega contacts the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Dept., which provides law enforcement in the area of Crestline and the Scientology base, about the witness sighting. They respond that there's not enough evidence of a crime for them to check it out.
* December 2018: Leah Remini and Mike Rinder air an episode of their TV show ""Scientology and the Aftermath"" about Shelly's disappearance. The Church of Scientology responds: ""Remini is a foaming anti-Scientologist. Mrs. Miscavige has personally and repeatedly told law enforcement that Remini's acts are abusive. Remini is unhinged and Remini and her cohorts should be prosecuted for knowingly filing a false missing person's report.""
* January 18, 2022: On this day, Shelly Miscavige will turn 61 years old. There has been only one confirmed sighting of her since she was 44. Does she know when it's Christmas, or her birthday? She very well may not.

25 years ago today, a six year old child named Jonbenet Ramsey was kidnapped from her bedroom and murdered in her own home. It was Christmas night when a predator took her from her bed and strangled her, leaving a golden cross tangled in the weapon that stole her young life.

The vengeance with which she was murdered reverberated, first through the city of Boulder, and then the world. This senseless act of violence inflicted trauma on an innocent child and everyone else in its orbit. 

Trauma looked different for different people. It looked like hundreds of cameras descending on a local PD, making it impossible for them to do their job. It looked like neighbors mistrusting one another, and being reduced to gossip and suspicion. It looked like victim blaming.

Jonbenet Ramsey didn’t vote to be a headline, a pop star’s Halloween costume, or a beauty vlogger’s arm tattoo. She didn’t elect to live in infamy on street posters next to Marilyn Monroe. **She is not a symbol.** She was a human being. 

If you care about this victim, then sign the petition to tell Boulder you care.

We cannot wait a moment more for the wheels of bureaucracy to catch up with the scales of justice.

- Please **be KIND** when you sign the petition. Our intention is to tell BPD that we support their investigation. Harassing their department will not get us anywhere. Be nice and remember that this group is the only one that can close the case. So tell them why this should be brought to justice.
- **Stay united.** I made the petition simple enough to be signed by people who care about this case, regardless of who they think “did it.” Whether you are “RDI” or “IDI” - please sign this petition and tell the BPD that this victim matters to you.
- **Concerned about privacy?** You can elect to sign this petition privately. Beneath the 'Sign' button you will see the 'Display my name and comment on this petition' option. Unselecting this option will 'hide' your comment and name from the main petition page. 

**To journalists reading this petition:** stop calling this child a beauty queen. I am floored by how many articles written this week still featured pageant footage. She was a six year old that liked to rock climb and was learning violin. Don’t talk to your J-school buds about sexism and then marginalize a murder victim in this way. Do better.

230,A_Wise_Mans_Fear,[],1640537898,"From December 2019 to January 2020, a series of widely sighted unidentified drones were observed in the skies of Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas. The FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration, and local law enforcement all investigated the sightings but have never determined the origins of the drones…

Now, come along my young padawans, for us to investigate the attack of the drones.

# The Sightings

New Year’s Eve, 2020, Placido Montoya from Fort Morgan, Colorado was on his way to work when he noticed blinking lights in the sky. There had been rumors of mysterious drones, UFOs, floating around the local community but it was a whole different thing to see them in person. Montoya decided to give chase, pushing his truck to 120 mph to try and keep up.

&gt;“They were creepy, really creepy,” Montoya said, “I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s almost as if they were watching us.”

That night, the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office received more than thirty calls from locals reporting more drones. 

At the same time, neighboring Nebraska and Kansas were dealing with their own mysterious sightings. One Nebraska deputy reported seeing 30 to 50 drones in the sky. All reports shared similar details: always multiple drones between 6pm and 10pm, flying in grid formations, with wingspans of up to 6 feet (which is quite large for a drone.)

These sightings caught national attention, with multiple agencies and political figures addressing the issue. Senator of Colorado, Cory Gardner tweeted: 

&gt;“I’ve been in contact with the FAA regarding the heavy drone activity in Eastern Colorado and I’m encouraged that they’ve opened a full investigation to learn the source and purpose of the drones. I will continue to closely monitor the situation.”

# Spoiler alert: They found nothing.

An interagency meeting was held in Colorado involving more than 70 federal, state, and local agencies (including the FBI &amp; the US Air Force.) They had a grand total of zero findings. 

So what’s it all about, Alfie? 

* Here are the most popular theories:
* The drones are military and the military are denying it
* The drones were being used as a tool for mapping (though there are strict rules for flying at night… also they wouldn’t be able to see much at night)
* Criminal activity of either the drug or espionage variety
* Mass hysteria (according to this Vice article)
* Aliens (always)

# Okay guys so… what did we learn?

The answer unfortunately is… not much. However, as more and more sightings and concerns over public safety come into popular discussion, it’s hard to deny that drone technology &amp; UFO’s are going to gain more attention.  

This past December, a provision buried deep in the $770 BILLION (holy moly) defense bill that the US Senate passed calls for the creation of a new agency to investigate reports of UFO sightings. And in June of this year, a government report on UFO sightings said there was no “single explanation” for over 140 incidents reported by military personnel that were deemed a threat to both flight/public safety and a potential threat to national security. 

The Pentagon also quietly announced that it had formed the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group to oversee this new agency… which critics attacked as an attempt to limit transparency on the subject.

All this to say, when the government forms a new legislature to investigate something, and then creates more legislature on top to hide the discoveries of those investigations… there may be more to the story than just “mass hysteria.”

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/rou52h/setagaya\_murders\_still\_unsolved\_in\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/rou52h/setagaya_murders_still_unsolved_in_2021/)

At their home in the Kamisoshigaya neighborhood of Setagaya in the western suburbs of Tokyo on December 31, 2000, the bodies of Mikio Miyazawa, 44, his 41-year-old wife, Yasuko, and their daughters, Niina, 8, and Rei, 6, were discovered by Yasuko’s mother, Haruko, who reported it to the police. Mikio, Yasuko, and Niina had all been stabbed to death, and Rei had been strangled to death as well.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department’s investigation of the crime scene revealed that the family had been murdered on December 30 at approximately 11:30 p.m. (Japan Standard Time) and that the perpetrator had remained in the house for several hours after the murders were committed.

 Miyazawa’s killer got in through an open window in the second-floor bathroom at the rear of the house, which is near to Soshigaya Park, by climbing up a tree and then removing the window screen. Strangling Rei, who was sleeping in his second-floor room, the killer used his bare hands to asphyxiate him.

Mikio went up the first-floor stairs after noticing a disturbance in Rei’s room, fighting and wounding the killer until he was stabbed in the head with a [Sashimi bōchō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimi_b%C5%8Dch%C5%8D) knife. According to a police investigation, a section of the Sashimi knife blade broke off inside Mikio’s head. The killer then stabbed Yasuko and Niina with the broken blade before murdering them with a [*Santoku*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santoku) knife from the Miyazawas’ house.

For between two and ten hours, the killer remained inside the Miyazawas’ home, using the family computer, consuming barley tea, melon, and ice cream from their refrigerator, using their toilet and leaving his feces in it without flushing, treating his injuries with first aid kits and other sanitary products, and napping on a sofa in the second-floor living room.

Mikio Miyazawa’s computer was analyzed. It was revealed that it was connected to the internet at 1:18 a.m. the morning after the killings and again at approximately 10 a.m., around the time Yasuko’s mother Haruko entered the house and discovered the murders. Haruko got suspicious when she was unable to contact her daughter (the killer had disconnected the phone line) and paid a visit to the residence but had no response when she rang the doorbell.

Authorities suspect that the killer had been staying at the house until at least 1:18 a.m., although Haruko also could have accidentally triggered computer use at 10 a.m. when she discovered the crime scene.

 The killer, who maintained a calm demeanor throughout the ordeal, left various personal possessions at the scene of the crime. The culprit does not appear to have been scared of being apprehended or of leaving behind evidence; thus, this does not appear to be an oversight. The suspect changed his clothes and neatly folded his outfight.

The suspect left behind Slazenger sneakers in Korean sizing (likely purchased in Korea), a dark green hip bag — this is similar to a cooler version of a fanny pack; a black handkerchief, a cape, or a scarf, a jacket made of down and winter gloves in black.

Certainly, the culprit was unconcerned about leaving any biological evidence behind. Apart from the bleeding bandages, he flushed the toilet. The stool was examined, and the police were able to determine what he had eaten the night before. It was regarded as a hearty dinner prepared by a mother. Another indication that he may have lived with his mother was a beautifully pressed handkerchief. Additionally, a bloody fingerprint was discovered, but it has never been linked to anyone.

However, police have been unable to identify or catch a suspect despite deducing some highly specific clues about the perpetrator’s identity. Based on an analysis of feces from the killer found in the Miyazawas’ bathroom, it was discovered that the killer had consumed string beans and sesame seeds the day before the murder.

After conducting an investigation, they discovered that the clothes and Sashimi knife left behind by the murderer had been purchased in Kanagawa Prefecture. Moreover, police discovered that just 130 units of the killer’s sweater were manufactured and sold. Still, they have only been able to identify and trace down twelve of those who purchased the sweaters.

Sand particles were also discovered within the hip bag that the culprit had abandoned at the site, which was later proven to have originated in the Nevada desert, more specifically the Edwards Air Force Base area in California.

The DNA and fingerprints of the killer were discovered at the Miyazawas’ home; however, none of them matched the DNA and fingerprints of the killer in the Tokyo police databases, indicating that they do not have a criminal record. It was discovered that the killer’s blood had been obtained during an investigation of the crime scene, which revealed traces of Type A blood that did not belong to the Miyazawa family.

Genetic testing on Type A blood determined that the killer is male and possibly mixed-race, with maternal DNA indicating that the mother is of European descent, possibly from a southern European country near the Mediterranean or the Adriatic Sea, and paternal DNA indicating that the father is of East Asian origin.

Physically, the killer is thought to be approximately 170 centimeters tall and skinny. The police estimate that the killer was born between 1965 and 1985 (15 and 35 at the time of the occurrence) because of the physique needed to enter the Miyazawa house and commit the murders. The wounds of the Miyazawa's show that the killer is likely to be right-handed.

 Despite the fact that the case has been open for two decades, authorities are not given up. The police intend to employ DNA analysis of evidence obtained at the scene, as well as the most up-to-date technologies, to create a picture of the perpetrator’s face and physical appearance.

The horrible killings of the Miyazawa family are still considered to be among the most heinous crimes committed in modern Japan. Will it be solved?

232,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,[],1640535959,"  Lester Eubanks is wanted for escaping the custody of the Ohio Department of Corrections while on a temporary honor furlough to go Christmas shopping in December of 1973. Eubanks had been serving time for the murder of fourteen-year-old Mary Ellen Deener. On November 14, 1965, Mary Ellen and her younger sister were doing laundry at a laundromat that day when they ran out of change. As she went to another laundromat to get more change, she disappeared.  
Mary Ellen was later found dead nearby. She had been shot twice and beaten with a brick. Eubanks was later arrested for her murder. He confessed that he attempted to sexually assault her, but he killed her when she resisted. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972.  
Eubanks later became an ""honor inmate"" at the Ohio Penitentiary where he was incarcerated. As a result, he earned the privilege of a Christmas shopping trip at the Great Southern Shopping Center in Columbus. On December 7, 1973, he and several other inmates were taken to the shopping center and allowed to shop for several hours by themselves. Although the other inmates returned to their scheduled pick-up location, Eubanks disappeared.  
Eubanks has not been seen since his escape in 1973. However, authorities believe that he went to Michigan afterwards and may have also spent time in Los Angeles, California. At the time, he was 5'11"" and weighed 175 pounds. He has black hair and brown eyes. He has a large scar/burn on his upper right arm. His birthdate is October 31, 1943.

On the night of December 31st, 2001, Mikio Miyazawa (44) his wife, Yasuko, 41, and their children Niina (8) and Rei (6) were killed inside their modest home. Of the victims, only Rei was spared the brutality of the knife attack; he was strangled in his bed. Mikio, Yasuko, and Niina were all stabbed multiple times. After they died, the killer stayed at the home for some time, consuming food and using the toilet.

 I am reposting this important article released by Japan Times almost a year ago [https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/police-still-hoping-killer%27s-dna-will-break-20-year-old-setagaya-multiple-murder-case](https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/police-still-hoping-killer%27s-dna-will-break-20-year-old-setagaya-multiple-murder-case) in the hopes of keeping interest in the case alive. Important excerpts from the article indicate:

1.  'The killer's unusual DNA indicates a father of East Asian background and a mother with roots in southern Europe or the Adriatic'
2. The killer did not bring the knife with him; he picked it up at the house. The knife was unsuitable for the purpose; it was a thin bladed sashimi knife

I have speculated previously that Yasuko was the focus of the killer. Do you agree with this? 

Is there any hope of this case being solved almost 21 years on?

234,VirtuallyDrunk,[],1640498025," Hello, all. This is a case near and dear to me, as I went to the same schools, as well as lived in the same general area as Tyler (Though I didn't know him or any of his family/friends personally).

This is his story, and his case.

On April 19th, 2016, Tyler Christensen dissapeared from Edmonds, WA. He was 16, almost 17 at the time he went missing (DOB: 06/02/1999). He weighed 145 pounds, and stood at 5'11. He was wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue shorts at the time of his dissapearance. Tyler is described as a Caucasian male, with light brown hair and blue eyes. As for any identifying features, he has a half-inch scar on his left ankle.

Tyler has four sisters, and his family describes him as hardworking and creative- he did odd jobs for his neighbors and made furniture and other crafts from metal and wood. He enjoyed hiking and riding his motorcycle. Tyler was also homeschooled.

Tyler was last seen in the 5300 block of Picnic Point, located in Edmonds, WA. He was seen at approximately 6:30pm on April 19th, 2016. Tyler had told his family he was going to jog to his youth group meeting, at the church him and his family attended, located in the 4700 block of 116th Street in Mukilteo, WA. This was about a mile from his home.

He never arrived to the meeting.

According to the local police, they belive he left of his own volition. I am not sure how they know this for sure, whether it be evidence or word of mouth, but they suspect he took a ferry from Edmonds to Kingston, WA, that same night.

The last person to see him was a man that picked him up; Tyler had been hitchhiking. The man described Tyler as ""upbeat"", and asked him directions to Shelton, WA (About 97 miles from his home; 1 hour and 40 minutes on via I-5 South)- informing the man he was going hiking at the Olympic National Park (About an hour from Shelton, WA).

In May, a month (give or take a few days) later, they located his dark-colored backpack near the High Steel Bridge, near Shelton, WA. Inside the backpack were a few emergency blankets, food, and extra clothing of his.

This was the last update in the case (as far as I could find). His page on the Charley Project webpage states he had no history of mental illness or runaway behavior. His family (and possibly his friends) hadnt witnessed any upset or odd behavior from him prior to his dissapearance. His family do not know why he would've run away in the first place.

Tyler's sister, Liz Christensen, stated she thinks he may be on an adventure, looking for something, but does not know exactly what he's looking for.

It's been almost 6 years since Tyler was last seen. He would currently be 22 years old. Tyler's DNA has been entered into federal databases for missing persons (stated in an article for the Heraldnet).

Sheri Ireton, a sheriff's office spokeswoman, stated ""It's still an open investigation."" (As of 2018).

There has been no update since then (from what I could find). I also couldn't find any information about the man who picked him up, or where he was picked up from. As far as I could find, they haven't named this man as a suspect currently.

The High Steeled Bridge, where his backpack was located, has had deaths in the past, from drowning or falls. The bridge is about 114m above the water/river.

235,Ar72,[],1640482671,"Patrick Warren and David Spencer were two English schoolboys who disappeared on 27 December 1996 in the town of Solihull, near Birmingham. Although initially treated by the police as runaways, they are now presumed to have died.Despite a BBC Crimewatch special report on the boys, along with numerous appeals from both their families, the case remains unsolved.

85-year-old convicted paedophile and sexual offender against young boys Brian Lunn Field has emerged as the main suspect in the presumed murder of the boys since his 2001 conviction for abducting 14-year-old schoolboy Roy Tutill in his car and murdering him in 1968. Field was living in Solihull in 1996 and is known to have been driving around in a white van in the vicinity of the boys' last known location on the night of their disappearance, while under the influence of alcohol. He had previously been convicted in 1986 of abducting two boys in his car and attempting to rape them. Police have on multiple occasions interviewed Field in prison about the boys' disappearance and suspect him of killing them, but have never had sufficient evidence to charge him.

On Boxing Day evening in 1996, best friends Patrick Warren and David Spencer left their Chelmsley Wood homes to play outside. Patrick left on his brand-new bicycle, which had been a Christmas present, while David was on foot.[3] The boys had been spotted by a police officer earlier that afternoon playing with another group of children in Meriden Park, where they had been warned by the officer not to play on the frozen pond. After returning home, they told their parents of their plans to visit one of Patrick's brothers that evening. Derek Warren, another of Patrick's brothers, went looking for the boys the next day when he found out that they had not arrived.

The last known sighting of the boys was just after midnight by a petrol station attendant who gave them a packet of biscuits. Patrick's brand-new red Apollo bicycle was found abandoned behind the petrol station near the bins, although the police did not realise that it was his until several weeks later. The petrol station attendant said she saw the boys walking toward the local shopping centre

237,Mobile-Accountant-97,[],1640454355,"Two little boys were out walking their dog on Boxing Day in 1959 when they came across the naked body of Lila Anderson, 38. She had a black skirt wrapped around her head. She had been abducted from a bus stop, dragged into a car, beaten with a tire iron and her head was then smashed against a rock. 

 Lila came from small town Rock Creek, BC and during the war served with the Royal Canadian Air Force as a sergeant cook. She moved to Vancouver after her discharge and first worked as an assistant night manager at the White Lunch and later as a cashier at the Safeway store at Broadway and Main Street.

In 1950 she bought a property on East 15th Avenue in East Vancouver and drew up blueprints for a boarding house. She hired a construction crew and supervised the work. When it was finished, she moved into the bottom suite and rented out the upstairs. Lila made it clear that her private life was her own business, and she expected her neighbours and friends to respect that. What they did know was that she loved to garden; she loved Mikie, her eight-year-old cat, and she was happy to stay at home and listen to the radio or watch television. Relatives and friends painted a picture of a quiet woman who liked her own company and preferred to live alone. She laughed at funny things, they said, was friendly to small children, and had a nice smile.

Lila told her sister and a neighbour that she had made plans for Christmas dinner but she didn’t say who with. No one saw her after she left home Christmas day. An autopsy determined that Lila had eaten about an hour before she was murdered.

“It is a dreadful commentary on a type of city as ours that such a crime could occur,” Vancouver Police Chief George Archer told the media. “Someone must have seen her travelling about the city, or at her Christmas dinner. Yet not one single witness had come forward to help with the investigation.”

Lila had two children both of whom she adopted out. Ross Dewar was born in 1947 and believes he has an older half-sister in Ontario. Ross recently connected with a half-brother from his father’s side after adding his DNA to the Ancestry.com genealogy databank.

It's awful to think of his poor family having Christmas without him and without knowing what happened to him or where he is. But I know that miracles can happen, especially in the case of missing hikers who are brought to this sub's attention. I am hoping there is a way that my fellow Irish person can be brought home to his family.

Cian McLaughlin (27) was last seen in Grand Teton Park, WY, on June 8, 2021. 

From RTE, Ireland's national broadcaster:

*A climbing guide reported seeing a solo hiker, matching Mr McLaughlin's description, on the Garnet Canyon Trail. His car was later found parked near Lupine Meadows.*

*His family has issued a new poster, appealing for help in finding the ""incredibly adored"" young man.*

*...*

*It details how Mr McLaughlin was wearing a red Apple Watch, white t-shirt, a pair of shorts (reportedly), wire rimmed sunglasses and a unique silver necklace on the day he went missing.*

*The family notes that Mr McLaughlin is ""an incredibly friendly person, it is likely that he would stop and chat with people or say hello in passing. We believe that he was alone"".*

More information from an October article on [Buckrail.com](https://Buckrail.com):

*The family of Cian McLaughlin, the missing hiker last seen in Grand Teton National Park, continues to search for McLaughlin ahead of winter.*

*Cian’s mother Gráinne McLaughlin, her partner, and her brother, Colm O’Higgins, have been hiking every day in the park in the hopes of finding any indications of where Cian might be.*

*RTE News recently reported* *on the ongoing search from Grand Teton National Park. “****This is not a rescue, it is a recovery but I’d like to bring him home. I know he is up there somewhere****,” Gráinne McLaughlin told RTE correspondent Brian O’Donovan.*

*Originally from Ireland, McLaughlin held dual citizenship. He had been living and working in Jackson prior to his disappearance.*

*McLaughlin was last seen on Tuesday, June 8, in the late afternoon/early evening on the trail on the south side of the Bradley/Taggart moraine. An individual reported that McLaughlin was headed south towards Taggart Lake and had a conversation with McLaughlin. He described where he worked, that he’s from Ireland and currently living in Jackson. The reporting party continued hiking towards Bradley Lake and did not see McLaughlin again that evening.*

Grand Teton Park is of course where Gabby Petito was found murdered earlier this year.","Where is the 27-year-old Irish hiker who went missing in Grand Teton Park, WY, in June 2021? Help bring Cian McLaughlin home"

One day, he wrote a note to his parents and disappeared. Canadian man Granger Taylor was only 32 when he vanished not long after building a life-sized spaceship that looked like a UFO in the backyard of his family’s farm.

 Taylor built a spaceship from the scrape metals in his yard that resembled a modern UFO. Using two satellite dishes, he created a living space almost like a treehouse. He equipped it with a TV, couch, and wood-burning stove. He spent a lot of time there thinking about the technology behind UFOs.

He left a note before leaving: 

 He wrote:

“Dear Mother and Father,

I have gone away to walk aboard an alien spaceship, as recurring dreams assured a 42-month interstellar voyage to explore the vast universe, then return. I am leaving behind all my possessions to you as I will no longer require the use of any. Please use the instructions in my will as a guide to help.

Love, Granger.”

240,NightTimePod,[],1640372628,"On December 21st, just days before Christmas, news alerts began spreading about a large police presence and a lock down at a Halifax children’s hospital.

When Halifax regional police shared a press release explaining the lockdown the city fell to it’s knees.

There was a shooting on Windmill Rd in Dartmouth. A young boy was injured in the shooting, transported to the IWK Children’s Hospital, but they were unable to save his life.

Four days before Christmas.

This release didn't share much more than that, no age or name or details, so of course rumours began to swirl.

When additional information was revealed it was via a Halifax regional police press conference, and it ended with an appeal to the public.

The victim, 8 year old Lee-Marion Cain was the occupant of a vehicle. The driver, a 25 year old man was also treated for non life threatening injuries. The suspects, two unidentified black men, shot from a burgundy SUV. 

Police are requesting anyone in the area with surveillance cameras to check their footage for the vehicle or people of interest.

241,tiposk,[],1640370500,"**FACTS** 

Michael Wayne Allan was a service manager in Plaza Dodge in Brooksville, Florida. He had divorced his wife around 1992 and had the custody of their boy since 1996. Allan had sued his ex-wife for child support and was scheduled for an appearance before a judge in November of 1997. 

On Halloween night of that same year, two weeks before the court appearance, Michael and his ex-wife Kelly Allan agreed that he would pick up his 7 year old son in Tampa to take him trick or treating. According to Kelly, he never made it to his destination. He was last seen leaving his job in Brooksville and nobody heard from or about him until someone spotted his 1989 Dodge Daytona in the parking lot of a shopping plaza at  40960 US Highway 19 N. in Tarpon Springs on November 25.  

Louie Houllis, a friend and co-worker of Michael said police told him that they found blood stains in Michael's vehicle, but this detail was never officially confirmed by authorities, as far as I know. 

In 2012, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced that remains found back in July of 1998 under the Howard Frankland Bridge in Tampa were positively identified as those of Michael. The remains were first believed to belong to an African-American  person, according to the Charley Project. Michael's case is being investigated as a murder.

**THEORIES**

Since Michael was headed to Tampa and his body was found there, I believe that he made it to the city or somewhere close enough. Whoever killed him disposed of his body in the Old Tampa Bay and drove his vehicle to Tarpon Springs. I don't believe Michael to have driven to Tarpon Springs and his body getting disposed of from another vehicle because Tarpon Springs is not on the way between Brooksville and Tampa.

Kelly is a natural 'suspect' since she was the person he was visiting in Tampa and the child support demand gave her a motive, but it is not clear if she is a person of interest in the case. Michael's mother also stated that she does not believe that Kelly was involved.

The police has a possible suspect and might know the manner of death, but this information has not been released to the public. In fact, there is not much information about this case which leads me to believe that authorities either do not know what happened or they know already but are struggling to find further evidence to make an arrest.

242,popsocksandpugs,[],1640358033,"[mysterious disappearance of Lars Mittank](https://youtu.be/l-89vr6wqDQ)

In June 2014, 28-year-old German tourist Lars Mittank traveled to the popular Golden Sands resort in Varna, Bulgaria, for a holiday with friends. After displaying unusual behaviour on the trip following a suspected beating, he bolted from the airport and was captured by cameras disappearing into a field of tall sunflowers. No trace of him has ever been found. Footage of his final known movements has been viewed over a million times on YouTube, leading to him being named ‘the world’s most famous missing tourist’.

Mittank and his friends arrived in Varna, a city on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, on 30th June 2014. A week later, while drinking in a bar with friends, Werder Bremen fan Mittank got into an altercation with fans of rival Bundesliga team Bayern Munich. After leaving the bar, Mittank disappeared, with his friends unable to locate him for the rest of the night. However, he turned up at their resort room the following morning, telling his friends he had been beaten by four men he had argued with in the bar the previous night. Some friends recalled his account differently, saying Mittank had told them the four Bayern fans had hired a local to do it for them.



Mittank photographed in 2013. Image: BKA Germany/Federal Criminal Police Office
An examination by a doctor found that Mittank did have injuries consistent with a fight, including a cracked jaw and ruptured ear drum. Prescibed antibiotics, Mittank was advised that due to his ear injury he would be unable to fly home with the rest of his party, that were due to depart that day. Reassuring his friends that he would be fine, Mittank checked out at the same time as them, before checking into the nearby Hotel Color Varna for one night.

It was during his night at the Hotel Color that Mittank began to demonstrate strange behaviour, appearing paranoid that he was being pursued by the group of men he claimed had beaten him the previous night. At one point he hid in an elevator for a prolonged period of time, before leaving the hotel at around midnight and only returning hours later. He even called his mother, asking her in a hushed voice to cancel his credit cards as four men were intending to kill him.

The following day, Mittank travelled to Varna airport, where he met with the airport doctor to discuss if his ear had healed sufficiently to allow him to fly home. During the conversation, it appears the pair were interrupted by a man who was working on a construction project in the airport. Startled, Mittank fled from the airport, wearing only a t-shirt and shorts, leaving the holdall bag he is seen carrying in earlier CCTV footage behind. Multiple cameras record him fleeing across the car park, before climbing a fence and disappearing into a field of sunflowers.","Where is Lars Mittank!!!???? I am so confused about this case, does anyone have any theories and what do you think about the drug mule theory? Or do you think he just wanted to start a new life? HELP!!"
243,acarter8,[],1640317796,"The Calumet County Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday that a set of remains found at High Cliff State Park in September 2021 are those of Starkie Swenson, a Neenah man who disappeared in 1983. They were identified through DNA analysis.


Starkie L. Swenson, aged 67, disappeared on August 13, 1983. He had returned to his Lakeshore Avenue home in Neenah, WI from a family picnic, and then took his bicycle and pedaled off into the evening. He never returned. His family reported him missing and issued pleas for help on August 18th, 1983.


In July of 1984, his family held a memorial service for Swenson with his wife, Lois Swenson, saying, ""In our hearts, we know he is dead.""


Swenson was declared legally dead in 1990 after a hearing before a Winnebago County judge. The death certificate says Swenson died on Aug. 13, 1983.


Fast forward to September 1993 when John C. Andrews, a 54-year-old Neenah man, was arrested on a first-degree murder charge in connection with Swenson's death. Police stated that Swenson was having an affair with Andrews' ex-wife at the time of his disappearance. 

A woman had come forward with basically ""ear-witness testimony"" claiming that she had heard her boyfriend at the time, John Andrews, ran over Starkie Swenson. That confrontation took place in the parking lot of Shattuck Junior High School (now the Shattuck Middle School) in Neenah.


Andrews accepted a plea deal in 1994 for a reduced charge of homicide by the negligent use of a vehicle. He was sentenced to 24 months in jail. Because Andrews was convicted of the homicide charge, the D.A. cannot add additional homicide charges now that Swenson’s remains have been identified. “The ability to charge someone for the murder of Starkie Swenson is gone. Mr. Andrews was charged and prosecuted,” said Haberman.


It wasn't until September 29, 2021, that hikers found Swenson's remains on a trail in a partially secluded area at High Cliff State Park in Sherwood, WI. This site is approximately 12 to 13 miles from the school parking lot where the confrontation took place, but the sheriff's office gave no indication of how the remains ended up at the park.

244,h0neybl0ss0m29,[],1640278791,"I came across Amery David’s case on the Charley Project page. There isn’t much info on CP, so I decided to do a google search on her – and this is where it gets weirder and weirder. There isn’t much at all about her out there except for one websleuths thread from almost two years ago. The more I read, the more confusing it got. I’m gonna try and summarize what little information there is and hopefully we can have a discussion – I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts and opinions on this case. 

**Background info:** Amery Kenny David was born on 10/7/1991 in the Philippines. According to her family, Amery met a middle-aged American male named “John Bohland” while studying in Manila in 2014. Later, Amery allegedly contacted her family and told them that she flew to Washington State to marry John and that they got married in Spokane in February 2015. Amery’s family claim that they never met their daughter’s husband. Later, Amery told her family that her husband had passed away. The family last heard from Amery via phone sometime in October 2016. When they didn’t hear from her, Amery’s family reported her missing to Spokane police. Her mother told authorities that Amery had passed the CPA exam in September 2016 and that she told her family she would be sending them money once she received her first paycheck. The family did not know what school Amery attended in Washington. LE has not been able to corroborate any of the information provided by the family.

**Here’s where it gets really strange:** According to LE, there is “no record” of John Bohland or Amery Kenny David/Amery Bohland anywhere. Users on Websleuths say that a search on the name “John Bohland” in Washington State did not yield any results and that there was no obituary for any person with that name. Furthermore, there was no marriage certificate or license for Amery Kenny David or John Bohland anywhere in the WA State public database. 

Amery did not seem to have a big online presence. There is a facebook profile with her name and picture that was set up about a month before she went missing and a few inactive twitter accounts, as well as an Instagram account that has since been deleted. She has 8 friends on facebook, including someone who’s most likely her mother, and she hasn’t been active since September on facebook 2016 either.

I really wish I could make this post more detailed, but this is really all the information there is.

**Questions:**

**1.** **Is it possible that Amery was never really in the U.S.?** If she passed a CPA exam like the family claims, there should be a record of that. If she attended college, there should be a record of that.  The fact that the police can’t find any trace of her in Spokane or anywhere else in the country makes me wonder if she was ever really there. But then again, would they even agree to investigate her disappearance if they didn’t have reason to believe that she was there? There should be some immigration records on her.

**2.** **What about the husband?** It looks like “John Bohland” never existed, so whom was Amery married to? Did he give her a false name? Was there ever a husband?

**3.** **Did the family fabricate everything?** If so, why would they do so?  

I’d love to hear everyone’s theories on this!

Bush and George W. Bush.  
Jack disappeared on December 28, 2010, after exiting an Amtrak train near Wilmington, Delaware. He was later seen on December 30 at 10th and Orange streets in Wilmington. On December 31, his body was discovered by a landfill worker as it fell onto a trash heap in the Cherry Island Landfill. His death was later ruled a homicide. His death was due to ""assault"" and ""blunt force trauma"". It was determined that all of the stops the garbage truck had made that day involved large commercial disposal bins in Newark, a few miles from Jack's home.  
Prior to Jack's death, he was sighted several times. On December 29, he was sighted at the New Castle County courthouse parking garage. He was disoriented and wearing only one shoe. He tried to gain access of the garage on foot, claiming that he wanted to warm up before paying the parking fee. He told the attendant that his briefcase had been stolen. He also said that he was not intoxicated. It was later determined that his car was in a different garage.  
Later that day, Jack asked a pharmacist in New Castle for a ride to Wilmington. He reportedly looked upset at the time. The pharmacist offered to call him a cab. He then left the store. On December 30, he was seen wandering around various office buildings, including Mitre and DuPont. Several people asked if he needed help, but he refused any assistance.

247,Punchinyourpface,[],1640207341,"35 year old Kathryn Adam went missing April 29th 1993


Text from a recent (April 2021) article...

After nearly three decades the disappearance of a Salina woman is still a mystery.  Thursday will mark another year of one of the most well-known missing person cases in Salina. It will be 28 years since Kathryn Adam was last seen.
On April 29th, 1993, 35-year-old Kathryn Adam went missing.
Adam was last seen at 4:30 in the morning that day, at a Kwik Shop convenience store in the 1700 block of West Crawford Street. She was preparing to head out on her job delivering hosiery. She was driving a full-sized Ford van with “She has L’eggs” written on the sides in blue lettering.
Adam was reported missing the next day, April 30th, by her 16-year-old daughter. The L’eggs van van turned up abandoned at 5:45 that evening outside a nearby restaurant. It was found at Russell’s Restaurant, which at the time was closed for remodeling, at 649 Westport Boulevard.
The van was spattered with mud on the outside, and had blood in the inside. Blood was also found at a storage unit in West Salina on Centennial Road where Adam picked up stock each day.
Police speculate someone attacked Adam when she went inside the storage unit. It appeared they interrupted her in the process of loading the merchandise in her van, leaving the door of the unit opened.
Though it is a cold case, it is still open. And though no body has ever been recovered, it is classified as a homicide.
Investigators periodically review the case, go over it, and remain hopeful in solving it. Things like changes in modern technology, and tips that trickle in help keep it active.
Early last week a human skull was found in an area of west Salina, in the same general area of the storage unit. Law enforcement are not able to make a positive identification of the skull at this time.  The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is assisting the Saline County Sheriff’s Office in the investigation. Saline County Sheriff Roger Soldan says that it appears that the skull had been in that spot for quite a while
Police encourage anyone with any possible information, no matter how small or insignificant they think it may be, to come forward. They can call Crimestoppers at 825-TIPS, text SATIPS to CRIMES (274637), or visit Salina Police Department and follow the Crimestoppers link to submit a web tip.
The Kathryn Adam case is featured on several social media sites dedicated to missing person cases. It is featured on Kansas Missing And Unsolved on Facebook, and also has its own Find Kathryn Adam page.

But there still hasn’t been an arrest in the case.

Paul and Julie Tsatsos say their son Ryan was always known as the life of the party, a young man who could make any bad situation good.

""He would do anything in his power to make you smile. If you were in the worst mood you were in the harder he would try,” said Paul.

That all changed in the early morning of November 1st 2015.

Ryan was walking along a stretch of road near the CMU campus, back to his residence hall with a group of friends.

“About quarter after two we got the knock on the door and I looked at who it was and I told him oh my gosh don’t even,” said Julie.

“I opened the door and they asked if we were the parents of Ryan Tsastos and I said something like is someone in jail is anybody hurt and they said can we come in and that’s when I noticed the chaplain was with them,” recalled Paul.

Paul and Julie lost their older son Darryl in a crash just months earlier.

Friends say Ryan died a hero, pushing a girl out of the way of the oncoming car before it hit him.

Tips began coming in to State Police shortly after, they believe the vehicle that hit Ryan has a dark metallic blue color and likely had damage on the passenger side.

Paul and Julie also traveled to Mount Pleasant shortly after the hit and run to make a direct appeal for tips.

But six years later, the case remains open.

If you have any information about who may have hit and killed Ryan, call Michigan State Police in Mount Pleasant, at (989) 773-5951.

BOISE, Idaho — *This article originally appeared in the* [*Idaho Press*](https://www.idahopress.com/)*.*

A man died of cyanide poisoning in Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Boise in 1982, where he left a note with his name signed on it. Only, Boise Police confirmed it wasn’t his real name — and the man is still unidentified to this day.

A national cyanide controversy from 1982, a priest murder, a cryptic note and a false identity are all part of the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death.

When nurse and church goer Virginia Almquist walked into Sacred Heart 39 years ago for mass on Dec. 3, she was approached by the church usher, Leo Leeburn, in a panic. His mother, Grace Leeburn, had discovered a dead man.

The man was found outside the confessional booth, face down and slumped over in the fifth pew. He was clean shaven with tan skin, sandy blonde hair, dressed in blue jeans, a green long-sleeved shirt accented with a turquoise bolo tie, a Seiko watch wrapped around his wrist, and cowboy boots fitted on his feet, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. He was believed to be between 35-45 years old.

The tale of the mystery man in the church was re-told in the family often, said Almquist’s daughter, Sharon Job.

On that cold December day, Job said, Almquist reached down to take the man’s pulse but found there was none.

“He was cold,” Job said.

Almquist rushed outside seeking Father Faucher, the priest at the time, who lived near the church.

On her way out, Almquist stopped Sister Mary Louise Deroin, who pulled up to Sacred Heart Church in her car for evening mass.

Deroin currently resides in Ventura, California, where she moved after retiring from being a Sister of the Holy Cross at Saint Alphonsus Medical Center.

“Virginia came out of the church and ran to the car before I could even get out. She told me that they had just noticed a man under a pew in the church,” Deroin told the Idaho Press in an interview. “She told me he was dead because she checked him.”

Deroin bolted inside the rectory and called police.

“I didn’t have a chance to see him. I didn’t want to,” Deroin said.

On Dec. 20 1982, the church held a funeral service for the mystery man. He was laid to rest in a gray coffin.

“He knew if he came to a church he’d be taken care of,” Faucher said.

### INVESTIGATION

According to United Press International News [archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/28/A-mystery-man-who-took-a-fatal-dose-of/1669409899600), a toxicology report stated the man had died of cyanide poisoning.

When the Boise Police Department arrived on the scene, officers found the man in a slumped over, kneeling position. After rolling him over, police found a cryptic suicide note written with a typewriter and $1,900 in cash inside a brown envelope in his shirt pocket, according to a police report. Coroner Mike Roberts estimated his time of death to be around noon. Witnesses found the man five hours later.

The note began with, “In the event of my death,” and instructed whoever found him to use the money enclosed for his funeral. Leftover money should be donated to the church, the note said. It also stated that the man wished to be cremated.

The note ended with the remark: “God will see to your honesty in this.”

The letter was signed “Wm. L. Toomey.”

But police could never confirm that was the man’s real name.

The police report stated the man’s wallet was empty with the exception of $53. All other forms of identification had been discarded, the report said. There was no way to put a name to the mysterious man.

“My mom was always sad his family never knew,” Job said. “We always said we wish they could find out who he was.”

Boise Police detective Frank Richardson, seven years later, said in a 1991 episode of “Unsolved Mysteries” that all leads to connect the man to the name William Toomey were exhausted, and he likely used a pseudonym.

“They kept his body at the morgue for a while to see if there was family they could contact,” Deroin said. “But, they couldn’t.”

Richardson said he later discovered “Toomey” was the name of a company that manufactured priest and nun garb, according to a [2005 article from The Austin Chronicle.](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2005-06-17/275319)

Richardson said in the episode police believed the man was from somewhere in the southwest United States, such as Texas or New Mexico, because of his sun tan in the middle of winter, bolo tie and large accented belt buckle with a Mexican coin in the middle.

Boise Police told the Idaho Press that currently no one in the department is working to confirm the man’s identity 39 years later with DNA, however the case is still classified as an open investigation.

### THE TYLENOL MURDERS

Deroin said the fact the mystery man poisoned himself with cyanide was odd because two months before his death, a national panic ensued regarding Tylenol laced with cyanide.

The events left seven people dead in Chicago and is known to this day as “The Tylenol Murders,” which remain unsolved.

“Maybe he was responsible (for the murders), came out and committed suicide for it, since he died of cyanide,” Deroin said.

According to [The Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/10/03/poisoning-is-traced-to-stores/4bfb56fa-88bb-4ac6-a97a-b698d39119c7) the Tylenol laced with cyanide came from two different manufacturing facilities — one in Pennsylvania, and one in Texas. One bottle was found to have 14 laced capsules out of the 50 in the bottle.

Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled more than 31 million bottles of Tylenol in circulation.

Others also echoed this odd coincidence. Jeff Wade, a Boise crime writer and researcher, has heavily researched the Boise John Doe. He said it seemed “interesting” and worth looking into that the man could be from Texas, where the cyanide-laced Tylenol was manufactured. The murders came just two months before the man poisoned himself with cyanide.

Additionally, a man from Texas died from a cyanide-laced pill in 1986, four years later.

Wade referenced the coincidental Tylenol murders, and stated he doesn’t believe cyanide was too hard to get at the time of both incidents.

### THEORIES

Robin Warder, host of “The Trail Went Cold” [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-trail-went-cold/id1084020770?i=1000391103303), featured Toomey’s case on an episode of her show, which focuses on unsolved mysteries and cold cases.

Warder told the Idaho Press she believes Toomey had a personal connection to Sacred Heart Church since he took his life there.

“I know that suicide is considered a mortal sin in Catholicism, so I’ve always wondered if he made a calculated decision to ingest the cyanide and hoped that he could receive absolution from the priest in the confessional before it took effect,” she said.

“However, since the confessional was occupied at the time, he died before he could actually see the priest.”

Deroin said there were few people in the church at the time, and no one noticed the man sitting toward the back of the numerous rows of pews.

Wade echoed the same belief, adding that it’s possible the man may have been molested by a priest and went into the church seeking some sort of revenge or recognition, but never was able to find it.

Wade also mentioned a possible connection to murders of two priests in Odessa, Texas. This theory potentially takes the cold case to Texas and Arizona.

According to the 2005 Austin Chronicle article, Father Patrick Ryan, a priest in Texas, was violently murdered in a hotel room in December 1981. A man named James Reyos was imprisoned in connection to Ryan’s death.

Additionally, another priest, Father Benjamin Carrier, was murdered in a hotel room in Arizona, the article stated.

Richardson was suspicious of these two murders being connected to his years-long cold case in some way, as he believed Toomey was affiliated with the Catholic Church.

Richardson had even traced Toomey’s belt buckle to a gift shop in Arizona, but that led nowhere, according to the “Unsolved Mysteries” episode. Toomey’s fingerprints were taken, which also led nowhere. To Richardson, that meant he was never convicted of a crime, wasn’t enlisted in the military and was not a member of a licensed profession.

For these reasons, Reyos’ defenders believe Toomey could be responsible for the deaths of Ryan and Carrier — Toomey had been in Arizona at one time, and he could have been a priest, someone who didn’t need fingerprints to just “pop up” in places, the article said.

“Toomey could have killed Ryan,” Wade said. He couldn’t say why Richardson felt there was a connection, but said “it had to be something strong.”

### FINAL RESTING PLACE

Dry Creek Cemetery is located off Old Horseshoe Bend Road in Eagle. The cemetery is quaint, with vast fields holding remains of loved ones that are scattered up and down the hillside.

Toomey resides there to this day. His gravesite is somber.

Falling snow clung to the surrounding grass in mid-December. The ground was coated with ice, and brown leaves covered Toomey’s headstone.

Toomey’s headstone is not much of a headstone at all, rather a slab of gravel and rock. He resides next to other unknown and unclaimed dead, who remain in the cemetery with similar headstones.

It almost looks as though his name was carved into the rock with a dull knife — the words are faded and barely readable after 39 years of weather and wear.

Job said her mother told his story “until she died.”

“My mother was always sad for him and his family,” Job said.

The story never changed, Job said, but there was always a sadness surrounding the local mystery.

Today, Boise Sacred Heart Church leaders refer to the unknown man who poisoned himself as the “Boise John Doe” — someone whose identity may never be revealed.

Toomey: A Mysterious Cyanide Suicide in a Boise Catholic Church
250,Quirky-Motor,[],1640201402,"**Disappearance**

On August 30th, 1979, two girls Carlota Sanchez and Elsie Luscier, aged 12 and 13 respectively,  left the village of Taholah on the Quinault Indian Reservation in southwest Washington state. According to Wikipedia, the hamlet of Taholah is a census designated place with a few hundred residents. One report says the girls left Aberdeen, Washington not Taholah. The girls may have been traveling to Seattle, Washington to visit their grandmother on another Indian reservation. It is not known which specific reservation this relative lived on. Some reports state the girls may have traveled to Arizona. However, most reports claim that the girls ran away from home. Whatever the circumstances, neither child was ever seen again.

According to a family member’s post online, both girls were reported missing in September of 1980, one year after they were last seen. Family members contacted both the Seattle Police Department as well as the Aberdeen Police department.  Namus, on the other hand, reports that the initial report came from Taholah authorities. Apparently the two departments (Seattle and Aberdeen) tossed the case back and forth between them until the stories of the two cousins fell through the cracks for good. 

In 2003 after the conviction of Gary Ridgway, Carlota’s sister contacted the Green River Task force to make sure they were aware of Carlota’s disappearance but they claimed they had never heard of Carlota’s case. This is probably because Carlota was reported missing to the SPD, not the King County Sheriff's office who handled the Green River Investigation. (Carlota also disappeared before Ridgway’s first known murders and was younger than his known victims.) However, it was this phone call that started, for the first time, the search for cousins Elsie Luscier and Carlota Sanchez. Dentals and DNA were collected from family members for comparisons to Jane Does but no matches were found.

In 2011 a relative of Carlota discovered the case of Fly Creek Jane doe, a young murder victim who was found in 1980 in Clark Co. Washington. Due to similarities in facial structure and a video the family made which is no longer available on Youtube, the family became convinced that this woman was Carlota. DNA returned not a match in 2011 and in 2019, Fly Creek Jane Doe was identified as Sandy Morden, a teen from the Portland area. Namus lists both cousins as rule outs for the Fly Creek doe. Despite the match, Carlota’s relatives are still convinced that the skeleton found near Fly Creek belongs to Carlota and they are using social media to find an attorney willing to take on their case. Besides several social media posts from the family, no progress has been made in the cases of either Elsie or Carlota as far as I can tell.

**Descriptions**

At the time of last contact, Carlota Maria Sanchez was only 12 years old. She was visiting relatives for the summer in Washington state, but lived full time in Yuma, Arizona. Carlota is described as a biracial female, being of Native American and Hispanic, specifically Cuban, descent although one report claims that Carlota is multi-racial of Swiss, Native American, and Cuban descent. She was 5’5”-5’7'' in height and weighed 110 lbs. when she was last seen. She has long straight dark brown hair, brown eyes, and a half moon shaped scar on her palm. She was born with two sets of eye teeth, but one set was surgically removed. She may go by the name Maria Loop and may spell her first name Carlotta. She usually wears blue jeans. Carlota has pierced ears. Her dentals and DNA are available for comparison. Her tribal affiliation is unknown.

It is unclear where Elsie lived although reports make it sound as if lived in Washington state. Elsie is described as a Native American female, only 13 years old. She weighed 110 lbs. and stood 5’1” tall. She had dark brown hair and eyes. In 1979 her hair was cut short, above the collar, and was wavy or curly. Like her cousin, her tribal affiliation is unknown.

Both girls have been ruled out as Fly Creek Jane Doe, and both are also ruled out as being Tucson Doe, which can be read about [here](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Tucson_Jane_Doe_(1979)).  I have submitted both girls as possible identities for Kalama Helen Doe who I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/lnv1b9/extensive_write_up_on_the_bizarre_case_of_helen/).

Strangely, for years the only information available on the cases revolved around Carlota and it wasn’t until 2013 that Elsie was revealed to also be missing. Before that all information on the case only mentioned Carlota as missing although one report said that Carlota “ran away with a cousin.” Although little information is available regarding the disappearance of Carlota, even less is available about Elsie. Elsie first got a Namus page trecently, and only got a Charley Project page in the last few years.

Today, the Seattle Police department is the investigating agency and in one press release for National Missing Children’s day, the SPD alleged that the two girls were last seen in downtown Seattle, not Taholah.  If you have any information regarding the case of either girl please call the Seattle Police department at 206-684-5455. Or if you have any other information on these two missing children please feel free to share below if you are comfortable doing so. 

What happened to Carlota and Elsie?

What happened to Carlota Maria Sanchez, age 12, and Elsie Luscier, 13, cousins who disappeared on the same day in 1979?"
251,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,[],1640188770,"  Thirty-two-year-old Rey Rivera was a writer and aspiring filmmaker who recently moved to Baltimore with his wife, Allison, at the behest of his best friend, Porter Stansbury. On May 16, 2006, he left his home in a hurry. His body was found on May 23 at the Belvedere Hotel. His death was ruled undetermined by the medical examiner. Police believe he committed suicide. His family disagrees with the suicide notion and believe he was murdered.  
Rey was very close to his family; growing up, his father was in the military, so he and his family were constantly moving. As a result, they spent most of the time with each other. In November 2005, he and Allison married in Puerto Rico. His family described him as happy and fun-loving. According to Allison, his dream was to become a writer and director. They had previously lived in southern California where he hoped to become a filmmaker. However, the jobs he could find were not bringing in much money.  
Rey turned to Porter, who was living in Baltimore. They had been friends since high school and played water polo together. After high school, they remained friends. Porter had a company, Stansberry Associates, that wrote financial newsletters. He had always wanted Rey to come write for him. Even though Rey did not know finance or stocks, Porter was persistent and really wanted to work with him.  
In December 2004, Rey took a job writing financial newsletters for Porter in Baltimore. He and Allison moved there but knew little of the area. They made a pact that they were going to live there for twenty-four months. They soon found a great home, church, and community there. According to Allison, they were very happy there.  
On May 16, 2006, Allison prepared to leave for a business trip. That morning, Rey woke up with her and made her breakfast. Before she left, he carried her suitcase for her and put it in her car. She then left for a three-hour drive. At around 6pm, after finishing her meetings, she checked into the hotel and called him. However, he did not answer, which she felt was strange.  
At the time, Rey and Allison had a house guest, Claudia, who was a work colleague of Allison's. Later that night, Allison called her and asked about Rey. She said that at around 6:30pm, she had heard him answer a call on his cell phone. She then heard him run out of the house in a hurry. While on the phone with Allison, she checked around the house and noticed that all of the lights were on. However, he had not returned home. The next morning at 5:30am, Claudia called Allison and told her that he still had not returned.  
Allison was certain that something was wrong. She immediately left her hotel and returned home. She called Rey's family and friends, but no one had heard from him. His brother, Angel, was certain that something had happened to him. That afternoon, he flew to Baltimore to help search for him. When Allison arrived home, she noticed that his car was not there. In the kitchen, she found an opened soda can, a bag of chips, and his Invisaligns. Upstairs, she noticed that the bedroom light and office light were on.  
At around 7pm, Angel arrived in Baltimore. By then, Claudia had returned to New York. Rey's mother, Maria, and Allison's parents arrived in Baltimore soon after to help in the search. Allison called several hospitals to see if he had been checked into them as a ""John Doe"". Porter put up a reward of $1,000 for information on his whereabouts. He was also able to get the media involved in this case.  
Rey's family and friends went to different places in Baltimore, including various coffee shops and restaurants, in the hopes that someone might have seen him. However, no one reported doing so. Allison noted that his credit cards were never used, his cell phone was dead, and there was no activity on their bank accounts. His loved ones feared the worst, but knew that they had to keep searching for him.  
On May 22, Allison's parents decided to search for his car in several parking lots in Baltimore. They eventually found it in spot #7 in one behind a building on St. Paul Street. When found, it had a ticket on it. The parking attendant told Allison that it most likely was parked there on the evening of Rey's disappearance, as he had found it there the following morning. She could not understand why he was there.  
Rey's car was found near the Belvedere, which is a historic hotel which now includes condominiums, along with restaurants, bars, and lounges. The company that he worked for, Stansberry &amp; Associates, is also nearby. Therefore, it did not seem that unusual that he would be in that part of town. Multiple searches were conducted in the area surrounding where his car was found.  
On May 24, three of Rey's coworkers decided to go to the top of the parking garage next to the Belvedere. When they looked over the edge, they spotted flip-flops on the lower roof area, near a hole in it. They immediately called the police. Officers arrived and had a manager open the door to the conference room with the hole in the roof. Inside, they found Rey's body on the floor. His family was told the news at Baltimore Police Headquarters later that day.  
As Rey's family and friends mourned his death, police began to investigate it. His body was found in a prone position and was heavily decomposed. Eight days had passed from his disappearance to the discovery of his body. Despite the decomposition, the medical examiner discovered multiple fractured ribs, punctured lungs, lacerations, damage to the skull, and two fractures to the right leg. With the extent of the injuries, it appeared that he had come from great heights when he went through the roof. Investigators noticed that the hole was clean and not too large. Rey apparently fell through it vertically.  
The biggest question became: where did he come from and how did he get through the hole? The first theory was that he either jumped off, fell off, or was pushed off the top roof and went through the lower one, which was about ten stories down. The top one was an approximately forty-foot open area. However, there are several different structures there, such as air conditioning units and air ducts. There was approximately forty-five feet between the edge of the roof and the hole.  
Detective Michael Baier felt that it would have been virtually impossible for Rey to have made the jump, especially in flip-flops. Allison recalled that he was very afraid of heights and would have been scared to be up on the roof as there was no railing. She could find no reason for him to be up there. Baier did not believe that he had jumped from the roof.  
The second theory was that Rey jumped from the parking garage where his coworkers had discovered the hole. The distance from the garage to it was about twenty feet. The height from the lower roof to the garage was also about twenty feet. Baier felt that a jump from the garage into the roof would have been survivable. Also, he did not believe that the injuries to Rey's body matched with a fall from that height. As a result, he ruled out this theory.  
The third theory was that Rey fell from a ledge on the eleventh floor. The ledge wraps around the building. However, he could only access it by going through either an office or someone's condo. Also, the windows were ""half windows"" which barely opened at all. Furthermore, the ledge was small and it would have been difficult to maneuver it without falling off of it. Due to the conflicting evidence, it has not been determined where he exactly fell from.  
During the investigation of the hole in the roof, Rey's cell phone was found. Strangely, there was little damage to it and it still worked. His glasses were found nearby. They also had little damage to them. WBAL-TV reporter Jayne Miller became interested in this case and reported on it several times. She felt it was strange that his cell phone and glasses had little damage despite the force that was needed to push him through the roof. Also on it were his flip-flops; one was broken while the other was not. Allison noticed what appeared to be drag marks on one. Baier believed that the evidence on the roof was staged. Rey's money clip was not found on his body. He usually kept his money, identification, and other items in it. They have never been recovered.  
Investigative journalist Stephen Janis looked into Rey's death. He asked several people at the hotel if they had seen him or heard anything that night. However, no one reported seeing him or hearing anything. Angel tried to recreate Rey's movements that night. He tried to walk through the lobby and upstairs to the roof. However, he does not believe that Rey would have been able to do this without being noticed or stopped.He noted that there are several back stairways and hallways that he would have had to navigate through before reaching the roof. Jayne noted that the door to the roof area was usually locked. It appeared that he would have had to know how to get there beforehand.  
Baier checked the cameras to the hotel but could find no trace of Rey. Unfortunately, the one on the roof was disconnected. According to Baier, no one could give him any indication that Rey was in the building that night. There were no witnesses or phone calls that placed him there. Despite the inconsistencies in this case, the Baltimore police ruled his death a suicide.  
Rey's family and friends do not believe that he committed suicide. Angel noted that he was not under any mental duress or psychoactive medications. Allison felt that they were in a very happy point in their lives. She claimed that he wanted to start a family with her. Jayne did not believe that there was any evidence that suggested he wanted to commit suicide.  
Allison met with the medical examiner who was involved in this case. The examiner said that they were not planning to close it, despite the police department's ruling. The examiner told her that the way his shins were broken was not consistent with a fall. However, they would not say how they believed the injuries actually occurred. Based on the inconsistencies in this case, the examiner declared the manner of death as ""undetermined"". This meant that they did not have enough evidence to determine if his death was a suicide, accident, or murder.  
While Rey was still missing, Allison was searching through their house when she found a note taped to the back of the computer in their office. It text was shrunk down to a very small font size. She determined that it had been written on the day of his disappearance because there were scraps of it in the trash can. It said, in part: *Brothers and Sisters, Right now, around the world, volcanos are erupting. What an awesome sight...whom virtue unites, death will not separate.*  
The note had different names on it, such as movie star and family ones. Baier considered it to be ""very unusual"". Allison noted that there was an entire page which listed people that he knew. However, some important people in his life were not included. There was also a list of movies that ""stuck with him"". Allison did not understand what the note meant as a whole. In it, he continued: *I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets. That's why I cherish them as secrets.*  
Allison decided to take the first sentence from the note and do a Google search on it. The first thing that came up had to do with the Freemasons. She noted that Rey was curious about secret societies such as them. She suspected that he may have been wanting to do a screenplay about them. Jayne felt that the note was cryptic and may have been written in code. In it, he also stated: *That was a well-played game. Congratulations, to all who participated.*  
Rey was known as a prolific writer and he wrote a great amount of stuff in different places. Allison recalled that he would often write about many different things on the same page of paper that would not make sense to anyone but him. The note continued: *Life is a test to see if you can control your spirit. Take care and enjoy the festivities.* Allison immediately gave tit to the police, who then sent it to an FBI lab. The lab determined that it, while unusual, was not a suicide one. Allison also does not believe that it was so.  
Another bizarre aspect of this case was Rey's abrupt departure from his home on the day of his disappearance. He did not take much with him on that day. It appeared that whatever sent him to the Belvedere seemed to happen in a hurry. Claudia recalled to Allison how she heard him answer the phone from his office and then quickly run down the stairs and leave the house without explanation. The phone conversation was brief and ended with the exclamation ""Oh."" The police traced it and determined that it had come from Stansberry &amp; Associates. However, there was no way to determine who made it because it came from a switchboard and they could not track down the extension.  
Once Rey's body was found and police tried to question Stansberry employees, the company put a gag order on the whole staff. They were not allowed to talk to police, according to the company lawyers. Porter did not return calls from the police and has not spoken about this case since the discovery of Rey's body. Baier believed that this was suspicious. Allison felt similarly; she did not understand why he would not want to talk to anyone about Rey's death.  
At the time of Rey's disappearance, he was a freelance videographer for Stansberry &amp; Associates, producing documentaries and videos of conferences. Prior to that, he was working on a newsletter called the ""Rebound Report"" which gives the reader stock tips to buy stocks that are currently not doing well but will rebound in the future. Before he came to Baltimore, Porter put out a letter under a firm called Pirate Investors that touted the investment in a Russian firm that planned to discover Uranium. However, the tip did not work out and investors complained.  
Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC) filed fraud charges against Porter and fined him approximately $1.5 million. The company claimed that it was their First Amendment right to give the advice about the Russian firm. However, according to the SEC, the advice was fraudulent. According to Allison, one of the reasons Rey came to Baltimore was to help ""clean up"" Porter and the company's reputation in response to the fraud allegations.  
About two weeks before Rey's death, Allison noticed that something was worrying him. She did not think much of it at the time. However, at 1am on Monday, May 15, the day before he vanished, the house alarm went off. When she went to investigate, he came quickly out of another room with a baseball bat. She noticed that he was extremely frightened by the alarm. This concerned her because he normally was not afraid of anything.  
The police came out to investigate the alarm. However, they told Allison that a squirrel had probably triggered it. The following Tuesday at 1am, it went off again. She noticed that the window, which was on the ground floor, had been tampered with. She believes that someone was trying to get into their house. She also believes that the incidents were connected to Rey's death.  
Allison believes that Rey found some kind of information that he was not supposed to find and was murdered because of it. However, she does not know what information he would have uncovered that would have led to him being killed over it. Meanwhile, Angel believes that his death was money-related. He suspects that someone lost a lot of money because of his ""Rebound Report"" and killed him over it. Jayne also believes that foul play was involved in his death and does not believe he committed suicide.  
Baier cautioned Allison about investigating Rey's death and believed that she may be in danger of the same people that allegedly killed him. He believed that he was the only homicide detective involved in this case that did not believe his death was a suicide. He believes that there is enough evidence to investigate it as a homicide. However, three weeks into the investigation, he was reassigned.  
The Baltimore Police Department continues to insist that Rey committed suicide. However, the medical examiner still considers the case ""open"". Baier believes that someone Rey worked with may have information that could help solve this case. His family is still hoping for a resolution to his case.  
**Suspects:** Porter is considered a possible suspect in Rey's death. Prior to his death, he had worked on a report that involved a stock tip about a Russian firm. It did not work out and investors complained. The SEC became involved and accused Stansberry &amp; Associates of fraud. Rey's family believes that these allegations may have had something to do with his death.  
On the night Rey disappeared, he received a call from someone at Stansberry &amp; Associates. He left his home immediately after. The caller's identity remains unknown.  
After Rey's body was found, a gag order was reportedly placed on all of the employees at Stansberry &amp; Associates. As a result, they were not allowed to talk to the police about this case. Porter has not spoken to police about it since then. His family suspects that Porter may have been involved.  
Angel also suspects that Rey may have been murdered by someone who lost money because of the bogus stock tip.  
**Extra Notes:** This case was first released on July 1, 2020 as a part of the first volume of the Netflix reboot of *Unsolved Mysteries*.  
Porter Stansberry declined requests to be interviewed for the case.  
**Results:** Unsolved. As a result of the broadcast, several tips were received about this case. However, it is not known if these tips have led to anything substantial. One online theory that has been brought up by a viewer involves one of the movies that Rey mentioned in his note: [The Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(1997_film)). In it, the main character jumps off of a roof and crashes through a glass ceiling. There has been speculation that Rey may have tried to recreate this scene, leading to his death. This has not been confirmed.  
There is some evidence not included in the broadcast that supports the theory of suicide. The FBI released a report stating that they believed Rey suffered from bipolar disorder. He and Allison were reportedly not happy with living in Baltimore. He also had been to the Belvedere several times before his death. Furthermore, he was friends with two bartenders who worked at a bar located on the thirteenth floor. They would often take smoke breaks on the roof; this suggested that he would have known how to access the roof of the hotel.  
Mikita Brottman, who lived in the hotel at the time of Rey's death, wrote a book about this case. According to her, multiple people there had heard a loud ""bang"" sound on the night of his death, despite reports saying no one heard anything. After his death, she tried multiple times to access the roof area, and only on one occasion was the door locked. Furthermore, a physicist determined that, if he was running at eleven miles per hour, he could have jumped from the roof and landed in the spot where his body was found.

I'm back again with another benign mystery. I worked on and off on this for quite a while and found the research really interesting.

As always here is [THE VIDEO VERSION](https://youtu.be/9Hcqoo7DIEo) for those who prefer it. I always try to make these with as little fluff as possible.

# The biggest secret in art history

Imagine, if you will, you are a town-dwelling early 17th century European. Throughout your lifetime you have been exposed to wonderfully crafted paintings in what would be known as the baroque period.

As you leave the local tavern, walking the cobblestone paved streets home, perhaps familiar with locally renowned painters like Rembrandt, el Greco and Breughel, you catch a glimpse of something strange.

You spot a painting, not just any painting. [A piece of art unlike anything you've ever seen before](https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2020/08/Johannes_Vermeer_-_Girl_Reading_a_Letter_by_an_Open_Window_-_Google_Art_Project-783x1024.jpg).

An indoor scene, details exquisitely placed, natural lightning that mimics the sun peering through your own windows. Truly a portal in to someone's life that seems indistinguishable from real life, as if a photograph taken centuries before the invention of the modern camera.

***NOT JUST AN INTERPRETATION***

In the 17th century, during what would be known as the Baroque period, important themes in art were emotional states, often dramatic and exaggerated. A sense of grandeur, drama, vitality and extreme movements. Paintings in a baroque style, as the word itself implies, did not ascribe to the regular or immaculate but would rather try to illicit an emotional response.

However, at around 1650 something changed. Some artists, mainly situated in the Netherlands almost overnight learned how to paint with the most exquisite of detail and perfect lighting, as if they had sold their soul to the devil in exchange for unprecedented artistry.

Perhaps the most famous of those artists was [Johannes Vermeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer). When I say famous in regards to Vermeer, I am actually referring to his paintings, not the man himself.

In fact, very little is known about this illustrious artist. His exact date of birth is unknown. As is the fact in how he gained his amazing painting skills. 

In the 1600s in Holland, it was customary as an artist to train under masters. Which master you trained under could lend credence to your own skill and thus increase notoriety as an artist. Therefore a lot of records about artists of that time had been preserved. This is not the case for Johannes Vermeer.

In modern days, somewhere between 35 and 40 paintings of his hand survived. Each one still displaying an uncanny sense of realism, as if painted with light itself.

But what exactly caused such a drastic shift in painting accuracy? Making paintings look more and more lifelike..

***TECHNOLOGY AND ART MEET***

What if painters like Johannes Vermeer and his contemporaries actually used technology to create their photo-realistic artworks?

The 17th century in Holland was known as the Golden Age and for good reason! International shipping trade and rapid advances in quality of life, made for a fertile breeding ground of technological advances.

One of the trades Holland was best known was its extraordinary lens crafting. Advances in lens grinding made these lenses arguably the best of their time.

So could it be possible that Vermeer and painters like him were aided by devices that included these masterfully crafted lenses?

In the book Vermeer's Camera, author Philip Steadman proposes exactly this. He says that it  could be possible these artists used some form of the camera obscura to capture images and trace over them.

However, when examining [Vermeer's paintings under an x-ray machine](https://countingvermeer.rkdstudies.nl/2-the-use-of-x-radiographs-in-the-study-of-paintings/25-x-rays-and-vermeers-painting-technique/), no sign of drawings or tracings of any kind were found. It seemed as if he had just walked up to a canvas and started painting free-hand.

***ENTER STAGE LEFT***

In 2013 famous Vegas stage magicians Penn &amp; Teller teamed up with Penn's long time friend Tim Jenison to make a documentary.

Tim is a business man and inventor, who developed an interest in Dutch golden age paintings and painters. After reading 'Vermeer's Camera', he decided to find out if it was possible the old masters used some form of technology, some kind of invention maybe, to help create their masterpieces. The film follows Tim as he explains how a simple mirror on a stick can reproduce very realistic works of art, with little to no experience in painting. By placing a mirror at a certain angle, one could line up a picture with a canvas and by moving the head up and down, constantly comparing colors, a match could be found by trial and error. A very lifelike picture starts emerging.

Throughout the documentary, Tim, through experimentation, further develops his aptly named ""[comparator mirror](https://www.easy-oil-painting-techniques.org/images/using-a-comparator-mirror-rose-painting-900px.jpg)"". He then decides to take on the huge challenge of trying to recreate a Vermeer painting. On top of that he sets for himself the challenge of only using materials and techniques that were available in Vermeer's time. 

This includes but is not limited to: lens crafting, table making, façade building and pigment mixing.

After 100s of days Tim Jenison finally finishes [his masterwork](https://media2.fdncms.com/sevendaysvt/imager/tims-vermeer/u/original/2333533/moviereview1-1.jpg). He shows it to a pair of art critics and it is lauded as being of equal quality to the original Vermeer, thus seemingly proving the comparator mirror could have been used by the Dutch golden age masters.

***SMOKE &amp; MIRRORS***

While Tim's Vermeer puts forward some compelling evidence in favor of the use of something like a comparator mirror by certain Golden age painters, the fact that the documentary is made by two famous tricksters might warrant some healthy skepticism.

In his blog, writer Joshua Gans created an article titled ""[10 reasons to Doubt Tim's Vermeer](https://joshgans.medium.com/10-reasons-to-doubt-tims-vermeer-c183bb3ce7a2)"". 

In it he cites several reasons as to why he suspects Tim's Vermeer is actually a hoax documentary. It's definitely worth a read and contains some compelling yet circumstantial evidence pointing towards it being fake.  It should be noted though that Pen Gillette has disputed these claims in a podcast and insists the documentary is genuine. Since Tim's Vermeer was produced several years ago as of writing this, it would have to be a véry long con.

It might still not be so far fetched that some kind of invention or secret technique was used in the past. There exist a lot of records of tutelage of painters and providence of certain works of art but the exact painting methods and things like how to mix the perfect pigment, was often a very closely guarded secret. It would be no surprise that such records be either lost to time or purposefully suppressed.

Maybe one day Penn &amp; Teller will come forward and claim their documentary as an elaborate misdirection or maybe some long lost texts will be found, lending credence to the theory of something like the comparator mirror.

Until then, whether or not the Dutch Golden age masters actually did use technology to aid them in the creation of their lifelike masterworks, will remain simply a mystery..

255,JoyIkl,[],1640163694,"No family, no home, Nguyen Thanh An - the son of a victim in a murder case has been living off whatever he job he can get while trying to find the one who murdered his mother more than 40 years ago.

**The case**

1980, Binh Dinh, Vietnam

When his mother - Phan Thi Khanh - 26 years old was murdered, Do Thanh An was only 7 years old. After the death of her husband shortly after An’s birth, she took An to Binh Dinh to live with her mother. “My mother was a hard working woman, he worked the field in whole day and she even worked at home till midnight” - Mr. An remembers.

“Our house was made of coconut leaves. There was this one time the house burned down. My mom had to dig through the still warm ash to find the gold that she hid under the bed. I remember there were a broken golden bracelet that my mom cut up to give a piece to my uncle when he got married, a few rings and a necklace. After the fire, my mom sewed a small pouch to hold what little gold she had left, she would always wear in front of the chest” - Mr. An says.

On the afternoon of the 31st of July 1980, An was waiting for his mom to haul the last load of corn from the field. However, she never came home. At around 7pm, he heard a neighbor yelled: “Your mom is dead, An!”. Those words would continue to haunt the boy for the rest of his life. When the police arrived, they found that Ms. Khanh was dead, killed by multiple stabs to the head, face and arm. The pouch with the gold was ripped apart and of course, the 2 ounces of gold was missing.

**The innocent suspect?**

Mr. Vo Te was a local physician who went to scene of the crime because he heard a person was sick. 1st August 1980, the police prosecuted Mr. Vo te on charges of “murder and theft”. However, after 5 months of investigation, Mr. Vo Te guilt was not proven so he was released. Due his status as a murder suspect, his family and neighbors shunned him up until his death in 1994. Later his son submitted a petition to the authorities asking them to terminate his father status as a suspect and give him back his dignity and honor.

**The real killer?**

Mr. Truong Dinh Chi was the brother in law of Ms. Khanh’s brother. He and his wife was staying at Ms. Khanh’s brother’s house. They had no money, only 30 kg of fertilizer. On the afternoon of Ms. Khanh’s murder, nobody saw Mr. Chi. Two days after the murder, he and his wife said that they were going to Cam Ranh to sell the fertilizer to pay off their son medical bill.

However, they did not go to Cam Ranh but went back to their home town and stayed in a small abandoned house next to the house of an unnamed witness. The witness said that he saw light coming out the house at midnight, curious, he peeked through the wall made of leaves of the house and saw Mr. Chi and his wife counting their money with two golden rings and a broken golden bracelet on the table.

After a short while, the couple bought a boat for 1400 VND. At the time, this was a huge sum of money which surprised a lot of people because a little while ago, the couple didn’t even have enough money pay their son medical bill.

An investigator who worked on the case shared that: “In 1981, I was working the local police to register the people who will be leaving the province. That day, Mr. Chi and his wife went to submit their ID. According to procedures, the police would keep their ID and return it to them the next day. However, Mr. Chi and his wife never came back for their ID and disappeared during the night. Perhaps he recognized me as one of the crime scene investigators and who took the testimonies of the neighbors. Mr. Vo Te’s testimony was true, there is only one suspect left - Truong Dinh Chi.”

**The rough childhood**

When his mother died, An was still small, his grandmother was too old to take care of him. An’s uncle moved in with his grandmother. “My mom died. I was an orphan. He would beat me so frequently that a neighbor took pity on me, went and got my paternal grandparents to take care of me instead”.

Barely 10 year old, An left his home to move to his paternal grandparent house. But they were also old so An never got the chance to go to school. Occasionally, An would visit his old house and the neighbors would talk about the murder. 

**The quest for the killer**

It has been 40 years since the murder but the police has not found the killer despite multiple denunciations from surrounding neighbors. In 1986, knowing that Mr. Vo Te was innocent, An visited the neighbors who submitted the denunciation letter to gather information and decided to track down the killer himself.

In 1990, An submitted to the police a denunciation letter. The suspect was Truong Trinh Chi (aka Truong Dinh Khoi), however, his whereabouts were unknown. A while later, An discovered that Chi had moved to his wife’s home town and changed his name to Le Minh Son. An immediately filed a denunciation letter to the police. The police determined that Le Minh Son was indeed Truong Dinh Chi, however, the suspect and his wife suddenly disappeared 

To search for his mother’s killer, An did not settle down. “ I have been living on the road for years, I would follow clues about the killer wherever they lead. Of course, no one would want to marry a vagabond like me” - Mr. An shares. He works wherever he can, from selling lottery tickets, working as a construction worker, dish washer… and quits his job to move to another place if there was a lead on the killer. “I work where I can, rent a room where I can so i can send and receive letters. For 40 years, every month, I would send a letter to the state authorities to remind them that my mother was killed in 1980 and till this day, the killer has not been found”.

An sent letters to multiple agencies from local to central government. He even sent letters to the head of the Party, head of State and the National Assembly. Anywhere he could think up that might help him in his search for the killer. But every time, the reply was the same: “please direct your petition to the local police”.

In 2017, Mr. An went the police again to send his denunciation letter. He provided testimonies and information he had gathered but the case went cold shortly after.

According to Vietnamese Criminal Code, the highest statue of limitation for criminal charges is 20 years. So it is unlikely that the police will ever properly investigate the case again and unfortunately, Mr. An might never get the closure he spent his entire life looking for.

“All I want is to know if Mr. Truong Dinh Chi killed my mother? I just need a concrete answer from the police. Every time I think of the untimely death of my mother, I can’s help but cry”.

256,B1Baker,[],1640140843,"December 20th, 12:30 pm, 2008.

Sanibel Island, Florida.

A horrifying discovery is made.

Sharon Michie went outside to check the mail.  What she found instead was a shocking revelation.  Elf-Mingo, a 20 inch tall, black eyed flamingo with a pink body, was nowhere to be seen.  The only thing left of him were his legs, still intact in the ground.  He was last seen wearing a 

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sharon went inside &amp; shrieked to her mother in utter terror, ""Someone Has Stolen Elf-Mingo!"".

The police were called.

When asked when the flamingo was abducted, Elf-Mingo was last seen at 10:30 pm last night, meaning this was likely an abduction in broad daylight.  

Missing flamingo posters were put up, exclaiming ""Elf-Mingo is Helpless without his Legs!"".  The posters were of no use though, as nobody had found Elf-Mingo yet.  

Understanding the direness of the situation, Judy Michie tested a theory of her own.  She suspected that a tourist had taken Elf-Mingo.  His legs were missing, so Judy Michie came to the conclusion that the legs must have been left there so Elf-Mingo could be smuggled through airport security.  

Believing that the time for finding Elf-Mingo was running low, Judy Michie took matters into her own hands &amp; asked tourists to keep their eyes out for the plastic flamingo.  

Before I continue on with the story, I would like to tell a bit about Elf-Mingo's life first.  Elf-Mingo was a family man.  His family included 8 little rein-mingos, Two Elf-Mingos, &amp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Santa-Mingo.  They were put outside for the previous two years for Christmas, Halloween, &amp; Thanksgiving.  

Now back to the story,

Beginning to lose all hope, the Michie family thought of ways they could prevent this from happening again in the future.  They ran through several ideas such as putting GPS trackers on the lawn birds.  They also bound all of the birds together with fishing line to make it more difficult to abduct a bird.

But then the unexpected happened, a Christmas miracle.

Sharon Michie, still distraught over Elf-Mingo's disappearance, walked to a party in a direction she didn't regularly travel.  

It was while she was walking there that she spotted Elf-Mingo, in front of the Greenhouse Grill.

She checked the belly of the flamingo &amp; found his tattoo, stating his name.  Without any doubt, this was Elf-Mingo.

Diane from Greenhouse Grill was credited for rescuing Elf-Mingo.  She had found him face down in a gully.  Not aware of the Elf-Mingo tragedy, she took him &amp; placed him in front of the restaurant.

The police were called &amp; the case was closed.

However, there is still a question left unanswered.  How did Elf-Mingo end up in the gully?  Was it a tourist like Judy Michie had suspected?  Or perhaps an animal?  Or maybe none of the above.  Foul play is still suspected in the case, it is thought that someone threw the plastic flamingo into the gully, but who? What reason would someone have to steal the flamingo only to throw it in a gully just a few minutes away? What is your theory on how this happened?

257,funeralposts,[],1640138221,"If you lived in a town of around 186 people that only measured around 0.26 square miles, where would you hide a body? In the town of Worthville, Kentucky, the answer might be “underneath an abandoned trailer.”

Underneath an abandoned trailer is exactly where a rottweiler named Rocks had dug up a human jaw and brought it back to his owner, Tammy Sculley, in the May of 2018. According to Sculley, when she took the jaw (that she assumed at the time to be fake), Rocks then brought her another jaw and part of a skull. Sculley would later state that she planned on cleaning these and placing them in her fish tank as decorations, as she had immediately believed they were fake. 

It’s not known whether or not Sculley herself chose to bring the remains to the police or if someone living with Sculley had advised her to, but Sculley brought the remains to the office of the Carroll County police. It would turn out that Sculley would have to buy new decorations for the fish tank, because the Carroll County coroner told Sculley that the remains were, in fact, human.

The small town and Sculley would find themselves in the midst of a media frenzy. It’s not hard to see why – in a town of fewer than 200 people, a dog brings his owner bones found underneath a trailer that had been abandoned following a fire five years prior? It’s a story that would seem the premise of a crime novel. A resident of the town would state that it “just don’t seem right.”

Every update seemed just to make the story more confusing. Cadaver dogs and K-9’s found no other traces of human remains in the area. None of the graves in the nearby graveyard were found to be disturbed. The only nearby missing persons case was too recent to match the remains. The trailer was towed and the land beneath it was searched to no avail. Everyone had questions, but no one had answers. 

There would, however, be an answer to one question. ""How is it that no other remains were discovered under or around the trailer?"" 

No remains were ever found beneath the trailer. Rocks never dug up any bones. In fact, Rocks wasn’t involved at all. 

In June of 2018, Sculley was arrested for falsely reporting an incident to the police. Sculley had fabricated the entire story about Rocks bringing her the remains after digging under the trailer, it would be revealed. According to Sheriff Phillip Marshall of Carroll County, the human remains were “artifacts” that had been stolen from a collector. 

However, Sculley was not believed to be the thief. The thieves are believed to be two burglary suspects (who have, to my knowledge, remained unnamed as they’re believed to be linked to many burglaries) who had stolen them from a storage container and then given them to Sculley. The reasoning for the remains being given to Sculley is believed to be simply to hide them, though it’s widely agreed upon that they were, in fact, meant to be decorations for a fish tank. 

Sculley worried about holding onto these remains and prepared to turn them over to the police. Before she did, however, Sculley feared that she would be implicated in the burglary. To avoid this, Sculley decided to fabricate a story about Rocks digging up the remains underneath the abandoned trailer. Of course, this fabrication had enough holes in it to look like the land that Rocks had dug up.

Marshall stated that there’s no indication of foul play relating to the remains and has not formally labeled them as John Does due to them being artifacts. However, the remains still went under laboratory testing. All three skeletal remains were determined to have likely been of European ancestry, and both jaws are likely from males. 

It seems, however, that that’s all the answers that we’ve been given. There are still many things that remain unknown. Who stole the remains, and how did they know Sculley? How old are these remains? What makes these remains “artifacts,” and how did the collector obtain them? Who do these remains belong to?

Despite being perhaps the most important question, the identity of the remains may never find an answer.

259,Bunnystrawbery,[],1640133165,"Kelly was last seen at approximately 8:30 p.m. in Gilmer, Texas on January 5, 1992. She was leaving her place of employment, Northeast Texas Video on Buffalo Street, and heading to the bank around the corner to make her usual night deposit. The bank's security cameras showed that an individual did make the night deposit, but it is unclear whether or not the person was Kelly. She has never been heard from again.

Kelly's car was discovered later in the evening in her employer's parking lot. One of the vehicle's tires had been slashed. The other three tires were intact. All of Kelly's personal belongings, including her purse, were inside the car, but her keys were missing.

A grand jury indicted Gilmer Police Department sergeant James York Brown and seven others on charges of Kelly's abduction and presumed murder in January 1994, two years after Kelly disappeared.

Prosecutors believed that Brown, who had been assigned to investigate Kelly's case, was involved with the seven other individuals with kidnapping and imprisoning Kelly for over one week. The state also contended that they sexually assaulted, and tortured Kelly while she was held captive, then stabbed her to death.

It was alleged that the group was part of a satanic cult and engaged in violent acts, including child molestation, as part of their cult rituals. Many of the defendants charged with Kelly's murder were also charged with sexually abusing children.

The murder charges against everyone were later dropped, two months after the initial allegations had been made. One suspect, a teenager named Michael Biby, was convicted of a misdemeanor for slashing Kelly's car tire. He admitted to the crime, but maintains he knows nothing about Kelly's disappearance and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The ""satanic cult"" was found to be nonexistent, a fantasy concocted by overzealous investigators. Brown and the other defendants maintained their innocence in Kelly's case from the onset of the investigation.

Kelly was dating Chris Denton at the time of her disappearance. He reportedly had a hot temper and police investigated him for possible involvement in her case, but found no evidence to implicate him. He died of cancer in 2004 and there were rumors he had made a deathbed confession regarding her case, but the stories were untrue; Denton maintained his innocence until the end.

Joe David Henry, the owner of Northeast Texas Video and the last person to see Kelly before she vanished, was arrested on child pornography charges in 2004. Authorities have emphasized that in spite of the nature of the charges against him, he has never been considered a serious suspect in Kelly's case.

Kelly was a student at Gilmer High School in 1992. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected.

260,areaunknown_,[],1640125496,"Quick background for those not familiar with the case- Sierra Lamar was a 15 year old girl from Morgan Hill, California . On March 16 2012 she disappeared during her walk to her bus stop. A few days later, on March 18, her purse was found in a rural part of town with her clothes neatly folded on top. Her jeans had a semen stain that DNA found belonged to a man named Antolin Garcia-Torres. He was eventually found guilty of murdering Sierra even though her body was never recovered. My question is what do you guys think happened to her body? I feel like her body HAS to be out there somewhere. I remember watching See No Evil on ID and detectives found that Antolin left his house before sierra even left to go to the bus and didn’t come home until 4-6 hours later (I can’t remember the time frame). 

So many unidentified bodies are found everyday I just happens to hope that hers is recovered. It broke my heart when her family said they won’t hold a funeral because it doesn’t seem right to without a body to lay to rest. I just wish the piece of shit who killed her confessed to where she is. I know this is technically a solved case but where her body is is still a mystery.

262,TheGreenListener,[],1640114064,"On New Year’s Day 1970, Geraldine Settee--described as smart, responsible and a lover of pranks and music--was an eleven-year-old girl living in St. Vital, then part of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. At this time, St. Vital was described as a “safe neighbourhood.”

Geraldine was the youngest of ten siblings, not all living at home, and was Métis, meaning her family was of mixed Indigenous and European descent. Geraldine’s family had moved from the Métis community of Matheson Island to St. Vital in 1962, when Geraldine was four years old. The Métis have a long history in Manitoba and in the Winnipeg area, and even today, Winnipeg boasts the largest population of Métis inhabitants per capita in Canada. 

According to Geraldine’s profile on the CBC’s site for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, at 8:00 PM on January 1, 1970, she wanted to go to a nearby drugstore to buy chips and pop. That same profile says “According to media reports, it was still daylight” so Geraldine’s father Leonard, who died in 1972, allowed her to go alone. Other sources claim that sunset was at 4:38 PM that day. I live in another part of Canada, and that would seem much more likely to me, given the latitude and the time of year. Regardless, Geraldine went to the store, approximately an eight-minute walk away, taking $1.30 in coins and a transistor radio her father had given her for Christmas.  

After twenty-five minutes, Leonard began to worry about Geraldine. He and another of his daughters went looking for her, and determined the corner store was closed. The next morning, one of Geraldine’s sisters and brothers-in-law found her fully clothed body near Fermor Avenue, approximately 13 kilometres from their home, in an empty lot. She had been stabbed six times in the back and chest with a knife 15 to 18 centimetres long and 2 centimetres wide. She had not been sexually assaulted. The MMIW profile says robbery was not a motive as Geraldine still had her money, although it makes no mention of the transistor radio. 

According to Geraldine’s brother Glen, who was seventeen at the time of her murder, the St. Vital police who initially handled the case were never forthcoming about the investigation. He told a CBC report, “We heard nothing from the police or the justice department. Anything I heard was from schoolmates at Glenlawn Collegiate or their siblings in Windsor School, and it was all rumours about one person…who was a knife freak.” Geraldine’s family also learned that two teenagers in the area had been threatened by a boy with a knife the week prior to Geraldine’s murder. 

The MMIW profile says that at the time of Geraldine’s death, a 14-year-old was interrogated but released due to lack of evidence. A more recent CBC article on the case says a 16-year-old was charged two years after the murder, but “there was not sufficient evidence to support the Crown proceeding with charges.” The Winnipeg police, which is now handling the still-open case, says they have kept the family informed.  

Interestingly, Leonard Settee told reporters that on December 5, 1969, Geraldine received a threatening phone call. He didn’t specify what the threats were, but said that she was so frightened by this phone call that she fainted the next time the phone rang. I looked for more information in this, but couldn't find any. 

While this is a case in which the likely murderer seems known to police, it remains officially unsolved, and the family continues to be without answers. Sadly, this is not an uncommon occurrence when it comes to the murders of Indigenous women and girls in Canada. I do, however, wonder about the phone call. Was it intended for Geraldine, or did she just happen to pick up? It seems from Glen's quote that her siblings were not personally acquainted with this ""knife freak"", but did he know them? Was the radio found with her? Was it just a motiveless crime of opportunity? And what of the apparently strange claim that it was still light at 8:00 PM in Manitoba in January?

Although he never met her, Geraldine's nephew Ryan Settee is trying to bring attention to the case and the way in which it was handled. He says he has attempted to contact the Winnipeg Police Service, the Crown and Manitoba Justice Minister Cameron Friesen but has received no direct reply. The Minister did email a statement to the CBC, which said ""The 1970 murder of Geraldine Settee is a tragedy, and the family carries the additional burden that the case remains unsolved 51 years later"" and he encouraged the family to reach out to the Manitoba Family Information Liaison Unit.

264,hellonurseb,[],1640113114,"On September 18th, 1995, the Bensalem Police Department found the skeletal remains of an adult in a wooded area behind the Club House Diner on Street Rd.  The victim was unclothed and wrapped in a plastic tarp. Autopsy information determined that the victim was an adult white female between the ages of 35 to 45 years old and that she had given birth at least once. She was approximately 4’8’ to 5’2” tall and had brown hair. The death was classified as a homicide by unspecified means and it was estimated that the body had been there for two to three years.  Some articles of clothing were found near the body may have possibly belonged to the victim. A blue quilted sleeveless vest, a pink t-shirt with “KPMG Peat Marwick”, and a white t-shirt with “Property of Alcatraz Penitentiary Swim Team, San Francisco”. Additional items found were a brown beaded seat cushion (possibly used in an automobile) and two crucifixes, one gold and one silver. Despite considerable media coverage, the decedent was never identified and there were no missing person reports that matched her. She was buried in Telford, PA under the name Jane Doe. In May of 2004, Bensalem Police exhumed her remains and sent them to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification where a DNA profile was extracted and uploaded into the CODIS system in an attempt to identify her. Additionally, the DOE Network assisted by providing a forensic sketch and sculpture to show what the decedent looked like in life. Over 50 missing women were excluded as being Jane Doe between 2004 and 2021. In November of 2021, BODE labs developed a DNA profile for this Jane Doe and uploaded it into GEDmatch and FamilytreeDNA.com.  Jennifer Moore, of Innovative Forensic Investigations, assisted Police by conducting genealogy research which led to the identification of Jane Doe. With additional sibling DNA comparison testing, the Bensalem Twp. Police Dept. is confident that Jane Doe has been identified as Merrybeth Hodgkinson of Warminster, PA. Merrybeth vanished sometime in September of 1992 after visiting with her family in Warminster, PA.  Merrybeth was approximately 31 years old when she died and worked as an exotic dancer in the Lower Bucks County area. The investigation has shown that she also resided at 719 Rhawn St. Phila, PA, the George Washington Motor Lodge, and the Oakford Inn.

Curious to see if this does get linked back to William David Montgomery:

Hodgkinson's death falls within the same time frame as a nearly identical 1992 murder in Bensalem. 

Toshiko Ciaccio, 42, a Japanese immigrant and exotic dancer, was found naked and wrapped in clear plastic and carpet near the development where she lived on Sept. 27, 1992. She had been bludgeoned and strangled, police said.

Bensalem resident William “Wild Bill” Montgomery was arrested in 1994 for the murder of Ciaccio and Philadelphia resident Amy Moore, 25, whose beaten body was found wrapped in a camper awning near the Delaware River in August, 1993.

In 2001, Montgomery pleaded guilty to both murders and he was sentenced to two life sentences, which he is serving at the State Correctional Institute in Somerset County, about 75 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.

McMullin said he suspects that Montgomery may have information related to Hodgkinson’s death. 

""I'm very confident,"" he said in an interview.

265,moondog151,[],1640106055,"Lake Rweru is a shallow lake 100 km2 in Africa dissected by the border between the countries of Burundi and Rwanda. From the lake flows The Kagera River from Rwanda. 

Starting in mid-July, 2014 fishermen in Northern Burundi who lived by Lake Rweru would discover several male corpses all of which in various states of decomposition and wrapped in white plastic bags floating on the surface of the lake. As the fishermen depend on the lake for their livelihood the discovery of the bodies caused panic due to the health concerns associated with bodies decomposing in their lake. 

The Burundian police collected the bodies and started to investigate however they would keep appearing with all of them being wrapped in white plastic with one exception the body of a naked woman was found decomposed in the same lake. On August 19 two bodies would be found and from August 24 - 25 5 corpses would be found. By the end of August alone a total of at least 40 corpses were recovered from the lake. None of the bodies were identified and no cause of death or how long they were in the lake has ever been determined but given the circumstances of their discovery foul play is very likely.        

During initial investigations Burundian officials determined that the bodies were not Burundian and that they were actually Rwandan nationals carried into the Burundian half of the lake by The Kagera River and because they assumed that they were Rwanda's citizens and that they likely died in Rwanda, Burundi claimed that the investigation was Rwanda's responsibility. However in response Rwanda report that no one on the Rwandan side of the lake had been reported missing and that since the bodies were discovered in Burundi that this matter was their responsibility to resolve. Burundi likewise claimed that no one on their side went missing  and both countries denied that these unidentified bodies belonged to their citizens.     

International pressure was put on both countries to conduct a joint and transparent investigation into the country but they both seemed keen on trying to dump responsibility onto each other. Rwandan police questioned villagers and fishermen living on the Rwandan side of the lake and they stated that they never saw any bodies wrapped in plastic floating on the lake at all let alone their side which Rwanda used as further evidence that Burundi had to look into the case. Some villagers however claimed that they were instructed not to speak to Burundian journalist however the Rwandan authorities deny these claims.  During March - June, 2014 there were reports of mass enforced disappearances in Rwanda but this was denied, Some of the alleged disappeared people reappeared but others remained missing. Some think that the bodies were disposed of in Rwandan marshland and that they only ended up in Burundi's portion of the lake after The Kagera River's flow had changed that year. And despite their governments claims even Rwandan villagers believe that the bodies flowed into Burundi from The Kagera River in their own country as they talked to Burundian journalist under anonymity and stated that they did see white plastic bags flowing down the river towards Burundi and that someone opened it to find a corpse that was bound by rope. The villagers didn't want to get in trouble with the authorities though so they didn't report the find. Many opposition parties and politicians in Rwanda demanded that their country conduct an investigation as well

 Burundi however is also no stranger to human rights violations with enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings being commonplace in the nation. And curiously the bodies were buried on the Burundian side very quickly after discovery before identification efforts could commence however the Burundian Authorities defended this act by stating that it was a matter of public health due to the heavy decomposition, Officials in the villages and region where the bodies were found also stated that they didn't have the technical means and resources to conduct autopsies or identification efforts on them. Some theorize though that the reason both countries are hesitant to investigate is less about wanting to pass responsibility onto the other but more about not wanting to strain the relations between each other which one Burundian politician described as being in ""Good shape"" 

The bodies continued to be discovered in September with two more bodies found in similar conditions at the beginning of the month. Four of the bodies recovered were buried in Kwidagaza village and in a surprising twist on September 21 - 22 a group of people would get in a boat and travel into Burundi docking at the village under the cover of night and making their way to the grave sites of the four bodies. A villager however scared them off and making his presence known causing the group of man to flee and board their boat to sail back to where they came. The Burundian police were informed of this and they discovered a shovel and a plastic tarpaulin which they believed would've been used to transport the corpses. Many accused these men of being Rwandan Marines and the fact that the group of men sailed into the country from Rwanda to secretly exhume the bodies and bring them back to Rwanda it reignited the controversy especially with their denial of having any involvement although a Rwandan official (unnamed) stated that this attempted grave robbery was ""Manipulation which aims to harm his country"" The Burundi army were then deployed to the village to guard the bodies after this.     

After months of pressure from NGOs, Human Rights Organizations, The United States and the European Union (both of which supply aid to Burundi and Rwanda) for both countries to investigate the bodies the Burundi authorities finally accepted an offer from the FBI to assist in the investigation and identification of the bodies however any information on the FBI's investigation seems to be unknown. 

The case would take another strange turn as on October 30, two more corpses one of which tragically being that of a child would be discovered on the Burundian side of the lake wrapped in plastic. The discovery was made by a fisherman however when the police arrived they ordered him and the rest of the villagers to just ignore and to not report any further bodies they may find with the police in the area simply stating they were following orders given from above. It is because of this that news slowed. On December 16, the two countries finally accepted an offer to conduct a joint investigation led by the African Union with forensic assistance from NGO organizations and other countries (Which Burundi requested themselves.) however there seemed to be no follow ups on this joint investigation headed by the African Union for a while.

In March, 2015 a retired Rwandan army captain named David Kabuye was put on trial for illegal possession of a firearm Incitement to cause uprising and defamation. However David also stated that the bodies found in Lake Rweru were from those kidnapped in Rwanda and even Uganda. He was acquitted later that year.

The hopes for a joint investigation would sadly be crushed as in 2015 during Burundi's political crisis relations between the two countries would severely deteriorate and at this same lake during 2015 - 2016 some Burundians would be shot dead by Rwandan soldiers trying to illegally enter the country while Burundi accused Rwanda of kidnapping Burundian fishermen and on July 31, 2017 three unidentified corpses would be found in a river bordering the two nations. 

The most recent news comes from 2019 when bodies started to be found in the lake again when on February 28, 2019 the unidentified and decomposing bodies of both a man and women would be found on the Burundian side of the lake which caused great concern as many of the residents still remembered the 40 - 50 corpses discovered at their lake in 2014. On November 11, 2019 a decomposing body was discovered in the and the next day on November 12 the bodies of a man estimated to be in his 30s and an infant were both discovered in the lake decomposed. They have never been identified but the Burundian police examined the bodies and determined that they were homicide victims. 

Sadly that is the last piece of information none of the burning questions such as the identities of the victims, how they died and if they were killed by who and why. 

However there is another theory that has been put forward. It's been suggested that the bodies are not Burundian or Rwandan but rather Congolese. The Imbonerakure are a Burundian political youth and opposition movement however they have been accused by many to carry out arbitrary arrests, torture and extrajudicial killings on the behalf of former Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza. The Imbonerakure have been known to enter into the Eastern portion of The Democratic Republic of Congo where they receive support from some Burundian diaspora and Congolese of the same ethnic group and tribes. However as a result of this they have been accused of contributing to the social unrest that has been plaguing the DRC and that some Congolese are members of The Imbonerakure.

During 2014 there was infight and rebellion from The Imbonerakure and their Congolese allies the Banyamulenge over not being paid but therformore when ever their allies the Banyamulenge (I should point out that they are not an organization but an ethnic group. This does not apply to all of them) got paid but sent their money to their tribal chiefs and themselves and also refused to assist Imbonerakure in their missions. Eventually a massacre took place resulting in the deaths of 47 with 37 victims being Banyamulenge and 10 Burundian. Four escaped but were caught and sentenced to a Burundian prison. The theory goes that the victims of this massacre were smuggled out of the DRC and dumped into Lake Rweru in Burundi and that they dressed the bodies up to look like Rwandans to pin responsibility on them as it would be difficult to avoid raising suspicions amongst the Congolese is they buried them in a mass grave or dumped them in local rivers.

This theory however does have it's holes such as mainly a lack of evidence but also the behavior of the Rwandan authorities such as how they appeared to attempt to exhume the bodies and also Rwandan villagers reporting seeing bodies flowing towards Burundi from The Kegara River.     

This is a very strange case that is unlikely to ever be solved.

A lover of the outdoors, her family described Margaret as having an adventurous spirit who felt most herself when she was white water rafting in the mountains. She was a reliable and thoughtful person who always made herself available for a friend in need. 

**A few months prior to her murder.** Margaret was living in Nashville, Tennessee when she met her boyfriend, Jere Dale Batts. Their relationship was often tumultuous despite Batts claims of never physically harming Margaret. On May 13, 2008, Margaret had filed an [order of protection against Batts](https://www.justiceformargaretsweet.com/news-stories/denver-post) after he had followed her across the country to Colorado Springs—on one occasion Batts left a teddy bear, a dozen red roses and engagement ring on her car.

**The day she was murdered.** On December 24, 2008, Margaret was home in Colorado Springs helping her father, James Egger, tend to her stepmother, Peggy who was recovering from surgery at a local hospital. Margaret and her father took turns visiting Penny. Around 11pm, neighbors overheard a loud verbal argument between an unidentified man and Margaret followed by a gunshot at her father’s home. 911 was never called. 

When Margaret’s father returned home the next day he noticed something on the white-picket fence. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was Margaret’s bloody body, with one leg in the basement well.

Cynthia wheeler had - green eyes, short dark hair and a sincere smile, Cynthia was 24 at the of time of her tragic demise - she was attending a college (uncp) in the small town of Pembroke north Carolina where she was studying criminal justice and worked at a local Piggly wiggly , Cynthia was first reported missing by her roommates on June 23rd 1997, Cynthia was last seen at a friend's dorm, afterwards later that night Cynthia apparently went to meet with an acquaintance.

the community and town of Pembroke was devastated, family and friends of Cynthia's determined to help aid in finding her - distributed fliers while law enforcement conducted searches

three to five days later wheelers car (which I founded through research may have been a Isuzu) was found bullet riddled and burned in a field at 710 highway Robeson County.

four to five months after Cynthia was last seen on that faithful night - hunters found Cynthia's remains along with her fila sneakers in a wooded area near 710 highway in Robeson County NC not to far from where her car was found.

four months after Cynthia's remains was found, a suspect named - Dane Locklear jr  was charged with her murder but the charge was later dropped after a witness recanted his statement.

years came and years passed while Cythina's loved ones and the community of Pembroke waited for answers and justice - when finally in 2000 - Dane confessed to killing Cynthia while waiting trail for the murder of his girlfriend Frances Persad (I'll be making another post for France) Dane went on to tell law enforcement gruesome details about the killing of both women, a tape of the confession was later shown in the trail of Frances in which Dane was sentenced to death. 

four years later Dane's conviction was appealed, he was resentenced to life in prison. 

the loss of Cynthia is still felt by those who knew her and loved her, remembering her as being ""down to earth, always smiling and looking forward to her career in law enforcement""

269,twobutcherbirds,[],1640020520,"[Joanna](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joan-queen-of-Castile-and-Aragon) was the third child of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, the medieval Spanish monarchs of Inquisition fame, whose union had united the separate Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon to form a dynastically unified Spain. Her siblings included two future queens of Portugal, as well as Catherine of Aragon, the future queen of England.

Raised in one of the most powerful families in Europe, Joanna was brought up to become an ideal future bride, as her title as princess meant she could be used to expand the power and influence of her family's kingdom. Like any other high-ranking medieval lady, she would have had a working knowledge of singing, dancing, languages, history, spelling and grammar, civil and canon law, hawking, riding, mathematics, philosophy, and needlework.

By around the age of fifteen, Joanna began to rebel against the strict Catholic doctrine her mother raised her with, refusing to attend confession and expressing 'heretical' views around Catholic rites and prayer. This expression was met with harsh punishment from her mother, whose devotion to the Catholic religion and hatred of heretics did lead to the execution of thousands of people. Mosen Luis Feffer, one of her father's chamber-men, wrote that Joanna had been punished for this behavior via ""la cuerda"", or 'the rope', where she had been suspended from the floor via a rope, with weights attached to her feet.

At sixteen she was betrothed to Philip of Flanders in an alliance set to strengthen the bond of Joanna's Trastámara and Philip's Habsburg families. Joanna left Spain to meet her husband in 1496 and the two were married later that year in what is now modern-day Brussels. Their union would produce six children, all of whom who grow up to be emperors or queens. Their relationship was one that waxed hot and cold, with the couple feuding over Phillip's infidelities and Joanna's jealous attempted to keep him from other women.

[Joanna's political fortunes changed with the deaths of her two older siblings and their children, which made Joanna the heir to her parent's kingdom](https://www.medievalists.net/2015/12/the-tragic-story-of-joanna-the-mad/). In 1502, Joanna was legally recognized as the heiress of the Castilian throne and named Princess of Asturias. When her mother died in 1504, Joanna became queen regent of Castile. This resulted in Ferdinand, her father, losing his monarchial rights to Castile. However, a clause in Isabella's will stated that Ferdinand could rule in Joanna's absence, or until her heir aged into the throne.

Ferdinand refused to accept this loss of authority and Phillip, Joanna's husband, refused to let his father-in-law take away his chance to control Castile. Both men minted coins with Joanna's name besides theirs, hoping to exercise their legal claims to the territory. Ferdinand also appealed to the same Castilian body that had named Joanna heir, claiming that her 'illness' would prevent her from governing, which resulted in him being appointed her legal guardian.

While Joanna and her husband feuded over how to handle her father's interference, Phillip decided to leave his kingdom and travel to Castile with Joanna in 1506. Ferdinand and Phillip met at Villafáfila in the summer of that year for a private meeting in a church, where Ferdinand swore to hand Castile over to Phillip and Joanna in a treaty. The pair also signed another, secret document, where they both vowed to prevent Joanna from being involved in government affairs, citing her ""infirmities and sufferings"". While Ferdinand attempted to weasel his way out of these treaties, he eventually abandoned Castile for Aragon, which allowed Phillip and Joanna to be declared King and Queen of Castile.

Only months later, Philip was dead of a sudden illness - either typhoid fever or, rumor has it, poison sent from his father-in-law. Joanna, pregnant with their sixth child and devastated at her husband's death, then attempted to rule Castile herself. Plague and famine overwhelmed her kingdom as she struggled to control her regency council and her subjects, who were on the edge of revolt. In the neighboring kingdom of Aragon, her father watched the chaos and bided his time. He returned to Castile in 1507, and when the plague and famine faded away shortly after his arrival, it seemed that Ferdinand had been sent by God to return Castile to health.

Father and daughter met that summer, with Ferdinand ordering Joanna to yield her royal titles to him. In the presence of three members of the royal council, allegedly summoned at Joanna's request, Ferdinand announced his new status as Joanna's regent. However, Joanna issued her own statement saying that he did not consent to the loss of her royal authority. Now queen only in name, Joanna was unable to stop Ferdinand from confining her inside the royal palace. Dismissing all her personal servants, Ferdinand had her surrounded by people loyal to himself. It was during this period that rumors of her madness began to spread, with some claiming that Joanna went into confinement with the exhumed body of Phillip to keep her company. Stories of her erratic behavior at this time aided her father's attempts to discredit her, as she alleged opened Phillip's coffin frequently to embrace the body, ordering that no women be allowed near the corpse.

At the death of Ferdinand in 1516, Joanna's eldest son Charles was named joint-heir of Castile and Aragon alongside his mother. The next year Charles arrived in Spain from Flanders to meet with his mother and accept his titles. After securing her consent for his rule, he continued her confinement within the royal palace, perhaps because some of the Castilian nobles still considered Joanna the true heir to the kingdom, as opposed to her foreign son. Charles, now Charles 1, was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, increasing his power and influence and antagonizing his Spanish enemies.

In 1520, a revolt attempted to overthrow Charles in the name of his mother, who was still legally his co-heir. The revolutionaries knew that if they could reach Joanna and get her consent to rebel, they would be legally allowed to overthrow the king. Charles' allies knew this as well, and arrived at the palace to advise Joanna to sign a document denouncing the rebellion. She refused, though when the rebels stormed the city and officially requested her support. While she refused to endorse the rebellion when asked, Charles realized that his mother would always be a threat to his right over Castile and ordered that Joanna remain in confinement for the rest of her life. As her time in isolation went on, Joanna's mental state began to decline. Convinced that the nuns caring for her actually wanted to kill her, she struggled to sleep, eat, or change her clothes. Allowed visits from her children, Joanna eventually became bedridden and died in 1555 at the age of 75.

Modern historians find the claims of madness aimed at Joanna to be someone suspicious, as she was known for her intelligence and resolve as a young woman - it was only after her marriage with Phillip that concerns around mental illness arose. Both her husband and her father had a lot of gain from removing her from the political picture, so having her declared mad would have been in both their interests. However, she had an allegedly extensive family history of mental illness, with her grandmother Isabella of Portugal, Queen of Castile also being considered mad.

So, what's your take? In my mind, it seems like a mix of both. An independent, headstrong woman mistreated by her family, Joanna might not have been mad when she was first imprisoned, but nearly a lifetime spent under those circumstances might have made her that way by the time she died.","Was Joanna of Castile and Aragon actually mad, or was she manipulated by her father, husband, and son?"
270,Mr_Write_NEO,[],1640013654,"Aria left her young daughter, Maleigha, with family members before being dropped off at the Harem, about half an hour’s drive northeast of Eaton, Ohio, where she lived. Her last contact with family was a phone call to her mother later that night.

Aria worked at a few different gentleman’s clubs in the greater Dayton area in the months leading up to her death. She’d amassed a stable of regular clients, mostly lonely middle-aged men who weren’t above trading the occasional gift or fancy dinner for a few hours of companionship with a friendly, bubbly young girl. At least one of these regular customers dropped off the radar completely following Aria’s disappearance, according to her sister, only returning to the club months later — at which point he promptly began fixating on another dancer who physically resembled Aria.

Other persons of interest include friends who visited Aria at work: one, a female acquaintance with whom she often shared “boy drama,” was rumored to be in possession of some of the missing girl’s property; another, a male friend, is shockingly rumored to have “bragged” to mutual acquaintances about being present the night she died. When approached  with this information, however, police allegedly declined to investigate, calling the reports hearsay.

Managers at The Harem were equally unhelpful, refusing to provide security camera footage from the night Aria disappeared until long after the fact. The Harem would later be ordered closed following a raid in 2017 which resulted in nearly a dozen employees and patrons being charged with drug and prostitution-related offenses.

Aria’s body was found lying next to a fallen tree and partially covered with foliage in a wooded area inside Art Van Atta Park, less than two miles from the Harem, two months after her disappearance. There were reportedly no signs of trauma to Aria’s bones, according to medical examiners, and decomposition was too advanced for any wounds to be detected; ultimately no cause of death was able to be determined. 

Rumors of an accidental drug overdose and subsequent cover-up swirl around Aria’s case; she’d had run-ins with the law, as it turns out, and was in fact on probation at the time of her disappearance, having been ordered to pursue substance abuse treatment in lieu of conviction on charges of theft in  2011. 

Police have investigated several leads. Reports of a naked woman being chased by men in a van on Gettysburg Avenue – on the crime and poverty-stricken west side of Dayton – turned out to be unrelated, as DNA found on clothing left at the scene was not a match for Aria. The man who claimed to be present when Aria was killed, meanwhile, was discovered to have been in prison at the time. And the jewelry supposedly found in the possession of Aria’s female friend couldn’t be positively identified by family members.

Clothing and a VIP coupon from The Harem found in an abandoned factory in Dayton were revealed to have been there since long before Aria’s death. A man cleaning out an apartment where Aria had once lived in Trotwood found her social security card, but nothing came of that potential lead, either, and the man who found the card has reportedly been cooperative and forthcoming with investigators. Tips from jailhouse snitches have also failed to pan out.

Finally, surveillance video belatedly released by managers at The Harem shows Aria leaving the club and possibly being followed by a man in a cowboy hat. But that man was identified, according to police, and cell phone pings confirm he was in Columbus by the time Aria’s death is believed to have taken place.

273,rriolu372,[],1639939716,"For us trans and gender non-conforming people, each passing year is a double-edged sword. On one hand, support and acceptance are becoming more common among the population by year; on the other hand, more anti-trans bills are passed and more of us are killed for being who we are. Even before trans rights became such a massive topic at the forefront of America's politics today, trans people were still the victim of attacks. One unsolved death of a trans woman is the murder of Loni Kai Okaruru in Washington County, Oregon.

Loni is described as a Pacific Islander trans woman, who was 5'9"", about 130 pounds, and had long curly/wavy black hair with a reddish tint. Loni, who was 28 at the time of her death, was unemployed and living with her family in Aloha, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. According to articles, her family accepted her as a trans woman and she had lived as a girl for most of her life. Loni was originally from Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory, and had moved to the Portland area with her family at some point. Loni's identification identified her as a female, but still listed her under her birth name, Lorenzo, possibly due to the lack of legal recognition for trans people in the U.S. at the time.

On the day of her death in 2001, which various sources state as August 21st, 26th, or 29th, she had been seen twice before. At 2 AM, Loni had been seen talking with a woman at a 7/11 near Southwest TV Highway and Cornelius Pass Road, in Washington County. And at 3:30 AM, she was seen hitchhiking along the highway near Southwest Murray Boulevard. While she was walking along the highway, two Beaverton police officers who were passing by met her and conversed with her, and asked Loni if she needed help with something, which she declined. 

Only a few hours later at 8 AM, a jogger found Loni Kai's body in an overgrown field near the highway. She had been viciously beaten around the head with a metal object, and the cause of death was identified as blunt force trauma. Investigators quickly concluded that she was likely killed for being trans, due to her identity as well as the brutality of the attack. They also suggested that the murderer may have been accompanied by another person who was also complicit in Loni's murder and helped dump her body. However, despite the work of detectives, no suspect was found. In 2003, after receiving a tip from a prison inmate, an SUV that police believed might have been used to dump Loni's body in the field after her death was found; however, the tip was soon found to be false. No major breakthroughs have come in since then.

Loni Kai Okaruru was murdered for being trans, 20 years ago, and her case has gone cold. Even so, both police detectives and LGBT rights activists work to raise awareness of Loni and her death, and maintain hope of bringing her murderer to justice. In 2006, Murray Rau, a now-retired Hillsboro police detective who worked on Loni's case said, ""We never give up hope that these \[cases\] are going to be solved. We never forget about them.""

276,A_Wise_Mans_Fear,[],1639925444,"In 1994 a woman was brutally murdered, and two men were accused and sentenced to life sentences later that year. Normal stuff, right? WRONG. So frickin’ wrong. Recent evidence from an escaped convict about a potential corrupt (and guilty) detective is causing the whole thing to be revisited in the courts!

Let’s bundle up for a Buffalo winter and head to New York. 

# The Murdah 

In mid-February, 1993, a woman was murdered at 84 Franklin Street in Buffalo, New York. Most of the details from the crime come from the initial catalogue of evidence, via video, by a veteran police officer named David Bentley who “had a reputation for closing cases.” 

(Keep his name in mind. He’s actually a brand new suspect in the case as of this year…but more on that later.)

The camera, with his voice over, panned the home as he entered. There was blood spatter on the floor. Things were knocked off of shelves and cabinets. A trail of blood led to the kitchen which was also a mess of overturned furniture. 

A five-inch steak knife with a bloody handle was jammed inside the kitchen drawer. Blood was also found on a dog toy, a recipe book, and somehow…in a gravy boat. 

Deborah Meindls, a nursing student and mother of two children, lay lifeless on the ground. She was stabbed to death. Her hands were cuffed behind her back, and one of her husband’s ties was around her neck. 

It was quickly deemed a homicide.  

# The original investigation, suspects, and arrest

This case’s path twists and turns a lot, so I’m going to outline the first set of inconclusive evidence and then go into the two main suspects (one of whom was eventually arrested with an accomplice). 

Mind you, I’m not diving into the newest suspect, Officer Bentley, just yet. He comes later. (I see you salivating for that Bentley info, dear reader. Just sit tight, it’ll come!!)

**Initial evidence**:

A postal worker heard someone inside the house that day of the murder when they delivered the mail. They also noted that the dog who usually barks at the postal worker, was eerily silent

Footprints in the snow led to the back of the house where a small rectangular cut was noticed in the rear window, about 6 feet off the ground. Investigators determined later that the hole was cut from…the inside?

Some of these footprints were left by Lori Rank, the first officer at the scene who also happened to be Officer Bentley’s daughter…(damn it, I said LATER for the Bentley stuff!) 

Investigators determined that the crime was “probably too violent for a burglary gone wrong”

**Donald Meindl (it’s always the husband right?)**

Donald Meindl, 33 years old, was a manager at a Taco Bell at a local mall. He became the police’s number one suspect really quickly. Mr. Meindl had apparently confided in his friend that he’d thought about hiring someone to kill his wife (not a great look, man)....a point made even more ‘spicious by the fact that he had a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife!

&gt;“It should be made to look like a robbery,” the friend recalled Mr. Meindl saying, according to a police report cited by the defense.

(During the 1994 trial against Lorenz and Pugh, Mr. Meindl insisted it was just a joke. Because we all joke about that right? Right?!). 

This guy gets even worse than that though. The couple was apparently in an open marriage, so naturally Mr. Meindl (reminder, he’s 33 years old) was seeing 17-YEAR-OLD girl who worked for him at Taco Bell. He even kept photos of her, scantily clad, in his wallet, according to trial testimony. In the initial police report written during the initial investigation, Mr. Bentley noted handcuffs and other items found in the home that were used for “sexual bondage.”

Yikes. 

Yet, his innocence was maintained by the MOST ON-BRAND alibi for this guy: the day of the killing, he was at Taco Bell, getting fired after being accused of sexually harassing his staff.

**Lorenz and Pugh (sounds like a law firm, if only they had actually been lawyers they may have gotten off…)**

Enter James Pugh and Brian Scott Lorenz. 

A few days after the murder, a confidential informant (a friend of Pugh who also sort of knew Lorenz) told the police that Lorenz was the killer and he’d left Buffalo. 

The police found him in Iowa, where he was being jailed for stealing a car. 

Being, well, incredibly stupid, Lorenz was so desperate to get out of the Iowa jail and get back to New York that he decided to confess to the murder (despite apparently not having done it!). He even implicated Pugh (who he’d often burgled with, a great friend I’m sure) just to give the story some more credence. 

His “confession” was so littered with false details that it was deemed inadmissible at the 1994 trial. What’s more, there was ZERO physical evidence or signs of forced entry by either man.  

&gt;“This is not a case, ladies and gentlemen, involving a lot of forensic evidence,” one of the prosecutors told jurors. “We don’t have any fingerprints to put them there. We don’t have his blood or something to put him there. We don’t have his wallet at the scene. We don’t even have a witness to come in here and tell you, ‘I saw him there.’”

The case instead relied on a series of witnesses testifying that they HEARD the men TALKING about the crime. 

Yet, the two men were charged and convicted anyway. 

# A third suspect emerges (yeah, it’s Officer Bentley, wonderful foreshadowing, eh?)

About 7 years ago, after Lorenz wrote appeals to various outside groups, an NYC civil rights lawyer got involved. He made a judge retest blood at the scene for any DNA evidence of Pugh or Lorenz…there was none. 

They reassessed witnesses from the 1994 trial. Many said that they weren’t sure what they stated was actually true. One was known for cooperating with police for murder convictions. Another had a drinking problem. It just wasn’t adding up. 

**So now here comes the bomb shell...**

Richard Matt and David Sweat were in prison together and planned a successful escape in 2015. (Insane, but that’s another tale entirely). After this escape - one that left Matt dead after being shot by a border patrol agent while on the run - Sweat sent a letter to the New York Times. 

In that letter, he said that Matt confessed to the murder of Deborah Meindls…and that his partner in the murder was none other than Officer Bentley. (DUM DUM DUM)

See, Richard Matt was a long-time informant of Officer Bentley (and apparently as “close as father and son”). And what’s more, Matt lived two blocks away from Deborah Meindls in 1993. 

According to Sweat, Richard Matt and Officer Bentley would team up to “rob and collect extortion money from drug dealers.” They’d even gone to a judge’s house twice to drop off bribe money. 

But there was a problem. A woman found out what they were doing and was threatening to expose them. That woman was, according to Sweat, none other than Deborah Meindls. 

What’s more, there is also circumstantial evidence that Deborah Meindls and Officer Bentley were romantically involved – something Bentley denies. But it would certainly explain how Deborah would have found out about Bentley’s extortion racket…. 

# What the heck is happening now?

Pugh is now paroled while Lorenz remains in prison for the crime.

Like we mentioned earlier, a team of NYC attorneys has officially accused the state of getting the conviction wrong. The official trial began this week.

277,supercarnoob,[],1639883144,"Andrea Cotten had a baby at 16 years old. She was from a small town south of Dallas, Texas and seemed to drift from a cousin’s house to her mother’s, to her boyfriend’s- who was 30 years old than her when she had their baby. Andrea wasn’t a bad person, but struggled with abandonment issues and desperately sought out love. She had taken to alcohol and marijuana, wasn’t attending school, and sometimes stole the alcohol from people. Her dad was in prison, her child’s father was soon headed to prison for a robbery, her mother’s boyfriend was a parolee, and neither her mother nor her boyfriend wanted Andrea to be with a man, much less have a baby with someone who was of a different race.

And then she disappeared. It was January 22, 2004 and she had visitation with her daughter scheduled for the next day. She wouldn’t have missed that. The details of her disappearance are sketchy- some say she was left leaving in a white van or truck with two hispanic males, some say it was a gold car and one unknown male. Others say it was murder. 

Was she killed for having a mixed race child? CPS had taken the child, who is now an adult, but no one seems to know why they took her or who called, though the possibility has been floated that her own family called CPS because they were upset about the race “problem.” The family did refuse to take the child because of that, but she was adopted by a loving family and whisked away from the mess of drama Andrea had to endure.

Was she killed by the man who committed statutory rape and got her pregnant? Or the mother’s boyfriend who didn’t like people of certain races? Was it the man who was mad that Andrea stole her beer, or a local who has supposedly confessed repeatedly to Andrea’s relatives? What about the man who failed multiple polygraph examinations?

This is almost all undocumented word of mouth small town gossip, but there is one fact: Andrea’s been missing for almost 18 years. Almost no one kn

278,Christmas_Leprechaun,[],1639877204,"Shortly before 11 p.m. on Oct. 23, 2006, Tom Wood, a Maywood Police Department K-9 officer, responded to one last call before the end of his shift — a problem of some sort by a storefront parking lot.

Turned out to be nothing, so Wood headed off. A colleague working that night figured he was going home.

Instead, Wood drove to Sixth and Erie, an area known for gang and drug problems in the long-troubled west suburb. Sitting in his marked SUV with his police dog Daro in the back, Wood ran the license plate of a Pontiac that was parked on the darkened residential street. And, for reasons still not clear, he called the girlfriend of a reputed Maywood gang member.

Within minutes, Wood, 37, was dead — shot repeatedly by someone who approached from the street and might have been talking to him through his partially opened window before opening fire.

The shooter bolted, and an intense investigation followed.

A full decade has now passed since Wood’s murder. No one has been arrested, and the police appear no closer than they ever were to catching the killer.

There were 48 cops nationwide who were “feloniously” killed in the line of duty in 2006, according to the FBI. Just three of those killings remain unsolved, those of: a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, Calif., who was shot during a traffic stop; an officer in Puerto Rico struck by gunfire amid a gang shootout; and Wood.

Early on, an entire task force of investigators, many of them from outside the suburb, focused on making an arrest, until they hit a brick wall. Today, Maywood — which, with about 24,000 residents, has 54 full-time sworn officers and is facing difficult times financially — has one detective assigned part-time to the Wood case.

Police Chief Valdimir Talley says there will be a renewed push to solve the case in 2017 — with the expected completion of a re-examination of the evidence that’s been gathered, the prospect of enhanced DNA testing and the possibility of two TV crime shows featuring the case and, Talley hopes, stirring up new tips to solve Wood’s murder.

“I owe it to the family,” Talley says, as well as fellow cops and the community “to bring closure. I’m definitely committed to getting this resolved.”

The slain officer’s widow, Helene Wood, says she’s hopeful but not optimistic the case will be solved any time soon. That’s in large part because, she says, the initial probe ended in shambles: “They don’t really have anything. What are they going to do with nothing?”

The police made plenty of mistakes:

• Bursting into the wrong house without a warrant.

• Allowing an initial suspect to wander the crime scene.

• Storing evidence in Maywood’s flood-prone police station, which ended up getting some of the evidence wet.

• Tearing down wanted posters because of a mistaken notion that a reward had dried up.

• Failing to interview some of the people Wood had seen or called in the days leading up to his murder.

And there were sometimes strong differences of opinion among investigators — in particular between Maywood cops and others on the task force — over suspects, including the reputed Maywood gang member whose girlfriend Wood had called.

Early on, some people questioned whether there might have been someone in law enforcement involved in Wood’s death. Over the years, a number of dirty cops were on the rolls of Maywood’s force —including one officer caught in 2010 stealing money from suspects during a sting. But the possibility of a cop being involved ultimately was deemed not credible.

In recent years, Helene Wood says it appeared that little work was being done on the case.

“The system failed us,” she says. “Maywood was the system.”

280,VastArt663,[],1639849376,"Mazen Al Hamada was a Syrian activist and a Technician  from Mohassan which was located in the governorate of Deir Ez Zor.  Mazen Al Hamada was detained by Security forces in Syria during the Arab spring protests which was against the Assad Regime who demanded Bashar Al Assad to step down and reforms. Arab Springs was a well known protest which took place  in the Middle east which happened in countries like Libya, Yemen, Tunsia, Bahrian, Egypt including Syria.  The Assad Regime had deployed Security forces who had fired at protestors with Snipers and Tanks. Protestors were detained and tortured also killed by Forces according to Human rights organizations like HRW, Amesty International and Syrian Opposition Activists. Mazen was one of the protestors who were detained. He had been imprisoned  for two and a half years for Participating in the protests. He was Severely tortured and exiled who became an Asylum seeker in the Netherlands. He Publicly testified the abuse he went through .  

Mazen had returned to Syria on October 22, 2020 he was detained by Syrian Intelligence services  and has been missing ever since.

 

At the time of the Arab Spring, Mazen Hamada, a graduate of the Institute of the Petroleum Industry, was a technician for the French multinational oil and gas company [Schlumberger](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlumberger_(entreprise)) , which had employed him for years [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) .

He takes part in demonstrations calling for more freedom and democracy. Mazen decides to film the events with his phone, his images are quickly disseminated, he is even interviewed by foreign journalists. He was arrested for the first time on April 24, 2011 by Deir Ez-Zor [State Security](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_de_la_S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9) , at his place of work, and released a week later. After a second arrest on December 29, 2011 and two weeks of detention in the same branch, knowing that he was wanted, he decided to leave for Damascus [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) , [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:2-2) .

## Arrests, imprisonment and torture 

When he arrived on March 1, 2012, he had an appointment with a doctor to whom he had to give doses of infant milk. The men embark on a car, gagged and beaten with kicks and sticks, and his two nephews, who die in detention [3](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-3) .

Mazen Hamada is led to the branch of [the air force intelligence service](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_de_renseignement_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_de_l%27air) of [Mezzeh military airport](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A9roport_militaire_de_Mezzeh) .

&gt;“They hit us on the head and on the back, then they put us in a collective cell of about 12 m². We were around 70 detainees, mainly from [Daraya](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraya) , on the outskirts of Damascus. Next to us was another cell in which they imprisoned around 70 detainees, including more than 40 Syrian army soldiers held on numerous charges such as ""considering desertion"" [4](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-4) . ""

During interrogation, under torture, he was asked to confess to being a terrorist, to possess weapons and to have killed soldiers. While he refuses to sign, claiming that he has never carried a weapon or killed, four [mukhabarat](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_de_renseignement_syriens) agents are called to come and torture him. He is hit and suspended by the wrists. To alleviate his suffering, he agrees to sign part of the ""forced confession"", admitting to having weapons to protect the demonstrators, but refuses to admit having committed crimes. He is therefore transferred to another interrogation room, where he is undressed and is sexually abused before ending up signing all of the documents [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:2-2) .

At the beginning of 2012, Mazen Hamada, suffering, was taken to [military hospital 601](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H%C3%B4pital_militaire_601&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) , nicknamed the slaughterhouse hospital, assaulted on the way and on his arrival, where he was named “1858” (his patient number). Although blindfolded, he saw detainees tortured to death, corpses piling up in the toilets. A member of staff kills dying patients there in the evening with beating. Mazen begs the doctor to return to detention [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:2-2) .

Back at Mezzeh airport, he was treated for a month by a detained doctor, before being transferred to the Qaboun military police on June 1, 2013 then to [Adra central prison](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_d%27Adra) on June 5, 2013 where he remained. about two months. He went to the anti-terrorism court, which ordered his release and was finally released on September 3, 2013.

During his imprisonment, which lasts 2 years and 7 months, Mazen Hamada suffered all kinds of abuse, including sexual abuse, and was violently tortured; he keeps serious consequences and physical suffering, the impossibility of founding a family [5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:1-5) , [6](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-6) .

## Exile 

After his release, Mazen Hamada is still wanted by the intelligence services. He therefore decides to leave Syria and asks for asylum in the Netherlands.

Mazen Hamada is one of the few Syrians to dare to testify openly to the violence suffered in prison, as well as the crimes he witnessed. He multiplies public interventions, hoping to raise awareness in the international community of the plight of Syrian detainees and recounts his journey through Europe [7](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-7) , [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) .

His testimony is important because he memorized the names of fellow detainees, soukras (forced labor detainees) and employees of the intelligence services. In addition, the CIJA recovered various documents attesting to the presence of Mazen Hamada in various services. He files a complaint.

## Back in Syria and forced disappearance 

Mazen Hamada decides to try to return to Syria. This decision, incomprehension for his relatives and the people who met him, could be explained by various reasons.

According to their testimonies, Mazen suffered a lot, both physically, from the consequences of torture (preventing him, among other things, from being able to found a family), and psychically, both from not having a future, from not being able to testify in court, to have the feeling of having multiplied the testimonies without any effect for the people still detained in Syria. Consuming cannabis to alleviate his suffering, he would have become dependent on it, has financial problems (asylum seeker, he lives on a temporary allowance while waiting to obtain refugee status allowing him to work), cuts himself off from friends and can't find a therapist who seems to understand what he's been through. His frustration seems to radicalize his speech,[5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:1-5) .

Mazen especially wants to help the tens of thousands of Syrian detainees, for whom he feels powerless to move the lines, but he seems to have been approached by people from the Syrian embassy, ​​close to the Assad regime, and to have been lured, lured into a trap, making him dare to be able to campaign for the fate of the detainees if he returned to Syria, he writes that he is ready to sacrifice himself for that [5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:1-5) .

Although not having a travel authorization as long as he is an asylum seeker, he goes to Berlin where he obtains a passport and visa from the embassy or consulate, a woman, probably from the embassy , gives it to him at Berlin airport [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) .

Upon his arrival at Damascus airport, he was apprehended by the regime's security services.

281,moondog151,[],1639848249,"(This is another case i've covered before back when I wasn't the best at making write ups and thus a case I wish to revisit with more information included)

It was January 8, 2000, and Turkey had recently entered the new millennium with business going as usual in Mısır Çarşısı a busy marketplace in Istanbul's Eminönü district. A man was out collecting picking up the papers in a rubbish bin when he noticed bloodstains on some of the papers he was retrieving. This prompted him to dig around until he found the source of the blood. A severed human leg.

Officers on patrol from the Yeşildirek Police Station were the first to arrive on the scene and after a search of the surrounding area discovered no further body parts the leg was taken for forensic examination. The examination discovered that the leg belonged to a female aged 26-27 and that it was cut cleanly from the hip. They also determined that the earliest the leg could have been severed was 24 hours and the latest 3 days. The leg was described as well-groomed with no hair and pedicured nails.

The victim was never identified and by the time the next victim was found no real progress was made.

The next incident was on May 19, 2000, and a boat had docked at Istanbul's Eminönü port when the captain heard the sound of something hitting against the bow of the boat so he went to check it out and saw another leg and at first he assumed it was a mannequin leg but soon realized it was real after poking it with a stick. The captain then reported this to the Yeşildirek Police Station. Before the police arrived though a passenger on the boat spotted another leg by the dock having washed ashore.

The police arrived and collected both the legs and they were taken for examination. They were determined to belong to the same person a woman aged 25-30. The exact time in which the legs were cut off is unknown due to being submerged in saltwater with the best estimate being a 7-10 days. They were both cut cleanly and the legs were well cared for with both the feet having red nail polish.

Investigators searched through missing person reports to try and find an identity for the woman and one possible ID they came up with was a woman named Sevim Işık a prostitute who operated in Aksaray and Taksim it's also worth noting that prostitution is legal in Turkey only in licensed brothels. The police could never confirm this identity or do the necessary test as they were unable to locate her family and thus this identity was never confirmed.

The next victim was found on December 7, 2000, by a group of high school students. Like the last two, the leg was well-groomed, hairless and pedicured. The leg was also severed precisely with the killer having knowledge of human anatomy. The leg was severed a few days before its discovery and it was thought to belong to someone who would be standing 7-8 hours a day. This victim was also unidentified.

The killer would strike again on March 12, 2001. Two legs were found in Haydar near the Unkapanı district. The legs were found 50 meters apart from each other and placed in garbage bags. However, both the legs belonged to two different people. One belonged to a woman between the ages of 20-22 and the other belonged to a man between the ages of 25-30. Both legs were severed at the knee with the woman's leg being carefully severed like the others while the man's leg was roughly cut off as if the killer hacked at it. Blood samples taken from the male's leg found traces of drugs and alcohol. Neither of the two was identified.

The next incident took place soon after on 22 March 2001 and this time the police could identify the owner of the leg. The leg was found at Tünel a subway line in Istanbul. The leg was amputated at the hip and was likely submerged in hot water before its discovery as no blood was found at the scene. The leg was identified as belonging to Yasemin Durgun a 17-year-old female law student born on September 4, 1983. Her bag was found two days later in Gümüşsuyu Park with nothing stolen except for her phone which was recovered in Tahtakale having been sold by a man determined not to be the killer. Yasemin Durgun is the only one of the killer's victims to be positively identified.

Yasemin's father was a police officer who formerly served in the military. While studying Yasemin ended up getting a boyfriend however this relationship ended up falling apart with the boyfriend saying ""School disrupts our lives, and affects our future"" Yasemin took the break up hard at first before meeting another boy simply referred to as ""AS"". Yasemin and the boy became very close friends but AS also befriended another girl simply referred to as ""SN"". During this time it is unknown what happened as details are fuzzy but the three seemed to get into a dispute which left their relationship strained but everything ended up working out.

Yasemin was last seen on March 20 and she was last seen at a post office. A meeting was arranged with AS however when Yasemin never arrived he returned to their school and asked if anyone saw Yasemin. When they all said no he reported it to the school's administrators who promptly notified the police.

On March 22, the severed leg of Yasemin was found garbage collectors at the subway tunnel like mentioned above. The police had already suspected that this leg belonged to Yasemin but her father refused to consent to allowing any DNA test to take place as he refused to believe that his daughter would fall victim to such a crime.

However on March 25 one of the payphones at Yasemin's school would ring and when a student answered a man responded and the student described him as either ""drunk"" or with a ""psychopathic voice"" the man on the other end than said ""Don't look for that girl, you won't find them."". The student reported this call to the school administration and the payphone would ring two more times and it would be the same man on the other end repeating that same sentence. After this call Yasemin's father accepted a DNA test to confirm weather the leg belonged to her daughter and that's how they finally identified their first victim in this case.

The last victim was found on July 20, 2001, at a beach in Maltepe. The leg belonged to a man between the ages of 30-35. The leg was severed at the knee and alcohol was found in the man's system. He couldn't be identified and he along with the other unidentified victims were buried in a cemetery for unidentified bodies.

The made the case their top priority however they were unable to come up with any suspects or leads as the identities of all but one victim were never determined although not for lack of trying as the police would search all nearby buildings where the legs were found to try and use ultraviolet rays to detect blood and for the second victim police employed police divers to try and search for evidence thrown into the sea. In 2002 three more severed legs would show up but these appear to be opportunistic crimes and copycats as the official victim count is 8.

A profile was set up about the killer however the profile was made by an American criminal psychologist named Richard Walter who was just told the facts of the case and likely didn't have access to primary sources so take this profile with a grain of salt as some information is likely wrong.

The killer is around 25 years old

He has a sexual motivation behind his crimes. Which wouldn't explain the male victims

The killer likely served time in prison before.

He likely spent time in Bakırköy Mental Hospital.

He is not a native of Istanbul.

The events all happened within 500 meters of each other in Odakule

The killer has no car and walks or uses public transport

What he does to hide them is unknown but he makes sure to not let the heads or hands be found so that the bodies can't be identified

He also tries to make the torso's are never found

He lets the legs get found on purpose because if he didn't at least let some body parts be found no one would know about him

He likely kills prostitutes due to them being vulnerable but since none of the victims were identified except for one with that one victim not being a prostitute this can't be confirmed.

The less precise murders and amputations done on the male victims are likely out of jealousy due to them finding success in relationships.

He likely has an inferiority complex

He steals from the victims

He revisits the crime scene to relive the experience.

He leaves the body parts in public solely to watch the panic when the crime is discovered such as leaving the leg of a victim in a subway tunnel.

As mentioned this should be taken with a grain of salt as it's not an official profile put together by the police or Turkish Criminal Psychologist.

Even though the last victim was found 20 years ago and no leads or suspects have never been found the case appears to still be open and there is even a hotline provided for anyone living in Turkey who has information that could lead to an arrest. 0212 214 40 36 however as the source providing this number is from 2002 it's unknown if this number is still active.

282,Orchidaye,[],1639824817,"  

Hello there, obligatory “long time lurker here”, and also the disclaimer that I’m not a native English speaker, so feel free to point out any mistakes or unclear expressions.

I’d like to introduce a case that I have never encountered on any English language site, which is bizarre considering that it’s not only international – crime scene in Germany, victims from the Netherlands, perp possibly from Austria – but it’s so bizarre and nonsensical, that I can’t believe it’s still unsolved.

Now, if I tell you that this case involves tourists being murdered and robbed, you’ll probably think “That sure is tragic, but it’s not exactly a rare occurrence”, but in most such cases, the victims didn’t get comfortable in the middle of nowhere for no apparent reason, quite far off their planned route. They also didn’t bring a violin that the robber left despite its potential worth, which means that it may or may not be a red herring. Also, most robbers don’t throw away their loot after the act. And they sure don’t ride around for hours in two different taxis, one of which they use to return to the crime scene!

But let’s start at the beginning. Truus and Harry Langendonk – 61 and 63, respectively – were a couple from the Netherlands, with Harry only recently having retired from his truck brake business when they started their journey on May 29th 1997 in Delden. Their choice of transportation was a camper, a Mercedes Benz “James Cook”, and since they were safety-conscious, they preferred to sleep on designated campsites with likeminded travelers. This time, their tour was going to take them along the famous and picturesque “Deutsche Alpenstraße”, the German Alpine Road, where you can also find the popular Neuschwanstein castle. This is where the aforementioned violin comes into play: Along the route there’s a place named Mittenwald famous for its violin manufacturers, where the Langendonks presumably wanted to get an estimate on their violin’s value so they could sell it later. Other than the violin, they didn’t carry anything much valuable, only their personal jewelry (like a watch and a necklace), and their travel fund in cash.

Based on the few photos that survived and witness sightings, their progress could be established as follows: They probably spent a night near Freiburg, so they reached the Bodensee (aka Lake Constance) on May 31st. Afterwards, several pictures where taken along the planned route, with one showing Harry bathing in the Walchensee, until they were spotted at the Chiemsee on the late morning of June 6th. The next day, they spent the morning in Übersee, and then… things get weird.

According to a waitress, the couple had lunch in Marquartstein, though the establishment named Schlossberg has meanwhile closed. The couple asked the waitress about the route to Reit Im Winkl, which is about 15 km south of Marquartstein by road… but somehow, for whatever reason, the Langendonks went the opposite direction, ending up in Litzlwalchen, which is 25 to 37 km north of Marquartstein depending on the roads you use. While on this route, they stopped to call one of their three adult daughters in the Netherlands, telling her they had been in Rosenheim and where now on their way to Chiemsee to visit a violin exposition. That last part is a bit shaky, though – the violin expo was only mentioned by one news report, so there may have been a misunderstanding. However, it has led to various theories among online sleuths.

So it was about 3 in the afternoon on June 7th 1997, a hot and sunny day, when the Langendoks steered their camper off the road, following an unassuming dirt road to an unattractive spot in the middle of nowhere. And I mean unattractive: The small piece of forest, which is literally named “Hölzl” – “Little Wood” in German – is between flat meadows and fields and contains not only an unsightly gravel pit, but also an abandoned landfill that has since been renaturated. Sure, the Langendonks couldn’t see those from their spot, but still. In fact, the only interesting thing there is a model airfield, but it was too far away from the couple to be enjoyable.

Luckily, there were people on the airfield that day, and they claimed they saw two or possibly even four people moving around the camper, so the Langendonks clearly remained at their vehicle instead of, say, going for a lengthy walk. Unfortunately on the other hand, the airfield was empty when three hours later, at 6 pm, shots were fired. A woman from the nearby village of Litzlwalchen heard a shot followed by a woman screaming, then several other voices followed by 6 or 7 shots in quick succession. Unfortunately, the crime happened out of her eyeshot, but several other people corroborated what she had heard. Strangely, the camper remained in his position for two hours, but was suddenly moved at about 8 pm. Most things had haphazardly been thrown into it, including the bodies, but several shell casings and even an unspent bullet were left behind at the crime scene, as was the camper’s step ladder, which was discovered at the other end of the Hölzl during the subsequent investigation, which would also discover that the perp had not only shot the couple but also cut their throats before loading them into the vehicle.

It was already June 8th, when the perpetrator parked the camper near Nuremberg, 300 km north of the crime. He set it ablaze, presumably using the can of gasoline you can see in the police photos, and left by foot, but it didn’t take long for the flames to be noticed, and police assumes that the horns of the firetrucks scared the perpetrator so much, that he alternated between running and hiding. How do they know? Because he took surprisingly long for an otherwise short way, and since he kept dropping his loot, they could even tell where he had crossed the road. Despite his panic, he was still clever enough to take the film out of the Langendonks camera to destroy it by light exposure, but some pictures could be salvaged and at least helped confirm the timeline of the previous days.

And yes, his behavior gets even weirder.

After calling a cab from a phone booth to get to the Nuremberg train station, the perpetrator entered a taxi at 2:10 in the morning. His appearance was bizarre: On one hand, he was dressed nicely in a dark sakko (a somewhat elegant sports jacket), shirt and tie, on the other hand his hair was greasy, his fingernails were dirty, and he was so sweaty that the stench was almost unbearable to the taxi driver. He didn’t say much, but his accent was either Austrian or Southern Bavarian, and he paid his fare in French Francs after the taxi driver declined his credit card.

At 2:30 he stepped out at the train station and crossed it to reach the southern exit, where he hired yet another cab at the taxi stand. He claimed to have missed his girlfriend and that he would have to use both trains and buses to get to her, which would be too exhausting, so he took the cab. This sounds credible, but doesn’t make sense, as he changed his destination several times: First, he wanted to get to the Munich airport, then he requested the Munich Northeast train station, *which isn’t even a thing*, before finally settling on Marquartstein. However, neither he nor the taxi driver knew the roads in that area, so the driver stopped at a highway rest stop to buy a map where the taxi was captured on CCTV, but the guest can’t be seen through the windows. And then it gets borderline stupid: As soon as they reach the area known as Chiemgau, the guest suddenly knows exactly where to go and directs the driver to Litzlwalchen, where he pays the driver in Austrian Schilling and dissolves into the woods.

That was at about 5 am on June 8th 1997 and we still have nothing to go on, even though in 2017 a special force was formed after new hints had been gathered. The case currently fills 130 police folders, by the way…

It is hard to believe we don’t even have a named suspect, considering the perpetrator’s erratic behavior and his unusual appearance. He was around 30, about 1.80m tall with shoulder length, blond hair and a crooked nose that may have been broken at some point in his past. He was dressed far too nicely for a lurker in the woods – again, sakko, shirt and a tie – so why would he hang around in this terrain? And where did he even get his weapon of choice, a Tokarev TT3 Kal. 7.62, which is popular in Eastern Europe?

Aside from that, here are the most nagging questions about the case:

· How and why did the Langendonks end up in an obscure and unattractive place far off their route? If the perp had forced them into the camper and directed them to that spot, why did he wait three hours to kill them and two more to leave?

* How did the perp himself get there? Some witnesses may have seen four people around the camper, did he have an accomplice with a car? If so, why did the accomplice leave and why didn’t he rat our suspect out? Was the accomplice the real killer and the suspect just a henchman?
* Why did a seemingly cold-blooded killer commit such a clumsy overkill? He needed several shots to murder a helpless, unassuming elderly couple, additionally slit their throats, and then left his empty shells and even an unspent bullet lying at the crime scene. Sounds like an overwhelmed rookie to me…
* What was the motive anyway? The Langendonks were an elderly couple in a rather small camper, there was no reason to expect a sizeable loot. Also, the perp threw away most of the stolen goods, so they didn’t mean much to him anyway and were possibly just taken to make the identification of the victims more difficult. The violin was also left to burn.
* Speaking of which: While it is probably a red herring, why would the Langendonks stuff the thing into their small camper to have it evaluated in Germany during their vacation, when there are violin specialists in the Netherlands?

I’m at a complete loss here, as are other online sleuths and law enforcement. It’ll take a lot of luck for someone to recognize the suspect, but there is a small glimmer of hope that the Langendonks and their grieving family find some form of justice.

283,MistressGravity,[],1639820500,"**Short background**

[Omar Raddad](https://imgur.com/a/hblTghB) was a Moroccan gardener working in France who was accused of murdering his employer, socialite Ghislaine Marchal, in her French Riviera villa on 23 June 1991. The prosecution's case largely hinged on something found at the crime scene, that being the words [*Omar m'a tuer*](https://imgur.com/a/XVQdqlu) (Omar killed me) written in Marchal's blood, and another, incomplete inscription (""Omar m'a t""). However, there was a grammatical mistake in the first inscription: the word ""tuer"" is the **infinitive** form for the word ""killed"", but the correct verb should have been the **past participle** form (""tuée""). The defence said that a wealthy, well-educated heiress would have never made such an error. Despite this, Raddad was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1994.

Raddad has always maintained his innocence, claiming that he was framed. Raddad's conviction sparked a debate in French society, with many citing the case as a prime example of the discrimination and injustice faced by immigrants in France. *Omar m'a tuer* has become somewhat of a famous catchphrase in France. Amid mounting public pressure, including from Morocco's King Hassan II, Raddad was given a conditional pardon by the then-French president Jacques Chirac in 1996, and two years later, he was released from prison. However, his conviction has never been overturned.


**Update**

In 2014, Raddad's attorney Sylvie Noachovitch successfully petitioned the court to authorise a new DNA test on the blood evidence found at the crime scene, including the infamous *Omar m'a tuer* inscription. The test result showed that traces of four men, none of them being Raddad, were found at the crime scene. A more comprehensive test conducted in 2019 found 35 traces of one of the four men on the second inscription (""Omar m'a t""). With this new evidence, Raddad's defence team filed a request in June to France's appeals court to review the evidence and reopen the case, which was granted on 17 December 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

It was April 26, 1913. And 13 year old Mary Phagan went to get her payment from her boss, the case's prime suspect Leo Frank, at his office. Awhile later, she would be dead. But what happened? 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that, contrary to the modern opinion, that Leo Frank was the culprit.

&amp;#x200B;

Her corpse was badly mutilated and she was raped prior to her grim death. She was found in the basement of the National Pencil Company, Frank's company, a day later. There was a hand written note next to her body, which was attempting to incriminate the night watchman Newt Lee. It was later revealed that the letter was actually written by the case's only other suspect, Jim Conley. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few suspects were interrogated, Leo Frank was arrested and charged with murder. Jim Conley was also apprehended as well, after lying to the police twice before breaking down and telling the story. And Conley's story was largely accurate. He stated that Frank accidentally murdered Phagan and needed his help to dump the body and write the ransom note to frame Lee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blood spots were found in the exact location Conley said that they were in, and Phagan's hair fibers were found in the same location he claimed to have found the body as well. Blood spots were also found in the same area Conley claimed to have accidentally dropped Phagan before picking her back up again, and the dragging marks on the floor matched his story to a t. 

&amp;#x200B;

Frank's most important case to prove his innocence was the 'shit in the shaft' theory, where Jim Conley claimed to have taken a crap on the elevator shaft, which crushed it later on when authorities entered the basement. The idea is that if the shit was only crushed by the authorities when they entered, that Conley was lying. However, this is not really the case as there's no definitive answer as to if the authorities were the first to crush the crap, due to the incredibly dirty floor and lack of evidence to support the claim in case documents.

&amp;#x200B;

However, evidence of Frank's guilt widens drastically throughout the trial. He constantly changed his story. Initially stating Phagan came into his office to collect her pay at 12:03, he later changed it to 12:05-12:07 and then even later on to 12:10-12:15! He was even proven to have lied about being in his office at the time of the killing, which was between 12-12:10. A witness went to his office at 12 and Frank was nowhere to be seen, and at this same time he claimed that Phagan was talking to a female worker that was proven to not have even existed! He also admitted that he was completely alone with her in his office.

&amp;#x200B;

He was also highly nervous in both police interviews and, according to the testimonies of Newt Lee and Jim Conley, was almost neurotic when Phagan was even mentioned after the murder. When Lee, who was completely exonerated at this point, mentioned that the murder could've taken place at daytime, Frank freaked out and did not want to speak on the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Conley and many other witnesses, Leo Frank was a sexual predator. Conley would claim that he stood guard as Frank would attempt to seduce teenage workers. Conley also had special privileges at the company, as he was the only worker that didn't have to punch in. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the smoking gun for me came from Leo Frank's testimony. When asked where he was between 12-12:10 in his final statement, he said that he might've 'subconsciously' went for a bathroom break! He pretty much shot himself in the foot IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Leo Frank was sentenced to death for the murder of Mary Phagan, which was later commuted to life imprisonment, which got him lynched by an angry mob. Jim Conley was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and is the prime suspect according to modern historians.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think happened to Mary Phagan? You might be better detectives than myself, so I'd love to hear your thoughts!

*On 27 October 2006, the body of a woman was discovered in a marshy field near the Darlington Nuclear Plant in Bowmanville, Ontario. Investigators determined that the woman was between 18 and 25 years old at the time of her death, whilst also noting that she had prominent, protruding upper teeth and visible white fillings on her front teeth.*

*A number of items were also found within the vicinity of the woman, which may have belonged to her, including a watch, a ring, and clothing, images of which you can see on the screen here. Although efforts were made to identify her, these proved unsuccessful, and she later became known as Bowmanville Jane Doe.*

*One of the difficulties faced by the investigators tasked with identifying her was the uncertainty concerning her date of death – it’s currently believed that she could have died at any point between 1981 and 2004. Another issue was the mistaken belief that Bowmanville Jane Doe was of European descent. Although the initial sketches produced of her depicted a white woman, DNA testing has since revealed that she was predominantly of African descent, with a substantial degree of South Asian heritage too.*

*This was discovered by the DNA Doe Project, otherwise known as the DDP, a non-profit organisation that works to identify John and Jane Does using investigative genetic genealogy. I’m one of the DDP volunteers working on Bowmanville Jane Doe’s case at the moment and we’ve recently come across new information that may be helpful in identifying her.*

*We’ve discovered that she was likely either from the Caribbean or was of recent Caribbean descent, based on her admixture and the heritage of her DNA matches. Although no one country can be definitively pinned down at this point, it seems that Bowmanville Jane Doe had distant cousins in countries such as Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, though she may well have had familial ties to other parts of the Caribbean too.*

*Additionally, if you have roots in any of the countries or regions mentioned, please consider uploading your DNA to GEDmatch and FTDNA. If you do turn out to be a DNA match to Bowmanville Jane Doe, your upload could be the factor that allows her to be reunited with her name after all these years.*

288,DJHJR86,[],1639757477,"Nick Hillary did.

If you are unaware about this case, it was the subject of a 2019 [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_Garrett_Phillips%3F) (*heavily* slanted in favor of Nick Hillary) which delved into the mystery of who murdered 12 year old Garrett Phillips in his apartment on October 24, 2011 in Postdam, NY.  Garrett lived in the apartment with his half-brother and mother, Tandy Cyrus.  Tandy and the half-brother were not home at the time of the murder (thankfully).  On the date of the murder, neighbors of Garrett heard a [commotion](https://dailygazette.com/2016/09/15/neighbor-potsdam-killing/) which sounded like a struggle.  Alarmed, they called 911, and the first responding officer arrived on the scene at [5:16 p.m.](https://www.northcountrynow.com/news/police-officer-and-emt-who-responded-scene-garrett-phillipss-death-take-stand-potsdam-murder).  After the responding officer got no response from the apartment, he called the landlord to come unlock the door.  A few minutes later, the officer and landlord entered the apartment and found Garrett not breathing and with no pulse.  EMTs arrived and were able to start his heart again, but unfortunately, Garrett died at the hospital.  An autopsy confirmed that Garrett had been strangled to death.  Outside of the apartment, a [window](https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/160928_vod_lead_investigator1_16x9_608.jpg) was pushed out (the woman in the photo shows the route the killer would have taken) and the killer apparently jumped from the window onto the ledge below, before jumping down onto the ground and escaping.  Police found a slip mark in the wet grass (it was lightly raining that day) where the killer appeared to have slipped on the ground when jumping from the ledge.  

Initially, the police investigated the theory that perhaps Garrett was killed by peers, but no concrete leads could be established.  They asked Garrett's mother, Tandy, if she knew of anyone who did not like Garrett and the only name she could think of was an ex-boyfriend of hers, **Nick Hillary**.  Nick and Tandy had dated for a year, but their children did not get along (and according to Tandy, Garrett did not like Nick **at all**), so eventually they both broke up.  The police were also interested in two other ex-boyfriend's of Tandy's, the father of Garrett's half-brother, and an ex-boyfriend named John Jones, who was previously a local sheriff's deputy.  The police spoke with the father of Garrett's half-brother, who allowed himself to be photographed, and voluntarily gave DNA and fingerprint samples.  He also had an alibi.  John Jones also did the same.  Jones told the investigators that he took his dog for a walk **in the opposite direction** of where Garrett's apartment shortly after 5:00 p.m., and eventually turned around and came back home around 15 minutes later.  Surveillance footage from across the street of Jones's home confirms this.  The police then turned their attention to Nick Hillary.

A friend called Nick the day after the murder and told him that one of Tandy's kids had been involved in ""an accident and I think he's dead"", to which [Nick](  https://abcnews.go.com/US/closing-arguments-fate-nick-hillary-now-judges-hands/story?id=42276731) never once asked the friend as to which of Tandy's sons it was (Garrett or his half-brother) nor did he inquire as to what had happened.  Later that day, that the investigators called him and asked if he would come to the station to answer some questions about the death of ""Tandy's 10 year old son"" (Garrett was 12) and Nick, again not questioning anything, agrees.  But he calls his friend (who is a lawyer) and then calls the investigators back and says he cannot leave because his teenage daughter is with him and he didn't want to leave her alone.  The investigators say they can stop by his place instead, and Nick agrees.  They very briefly question Nick and this is the first time (according to Nick) that he learns of Garrett's death.  The investigators leave and return the next morning at around 7:30 a.m. and ask again if he could come down to the station to answer some questions and Nick agrees.

At the station, they ask some general questions about some kids that Garrett may have known, potential enemies, etc. and Nick is very cooperative.  When they ask him ""where were you that day"", he becomes *very* defensive and refuses to answer anymore questions.  He refuses to be photographed, fingerprinted, or have DNA taken from him.  At that same moment, the police detain him at the station because they were actively trying to obtain a search warrant for his clothes, his person, and his car.  Nick calls his family attorney, Jane Garland, and she arrived shortly around noon.  At this point, the police ordered pizza and were holding Nick in a kitchen area where he was guarded by a state trooper.  The trooper observed Jane Garland taking a piece of pizza that Nick was eating, take a large bite out of it, and then place it in her purse.  Nick was also allowed to smoke while waiting for the authorization of the search warrant, and after smoking cigarettes, he would crumble the butts up in his hand, and put the remains in his pockets.  The search warrant was finally executed at around 4:00 p.m. and the police took Nick's clothes and photographed his body.  They noticed a fresh cut (later testified to under oath as happening within 24-48 hours) and abrasion on his ankle.  Nick and his supporters would later say this was done to humiliate and dehumanize him.  However, he was the **only** suspect or person of interest who did not cooperate.  

Eventually after a 5 year ""battle"", Nick was charged for the murder of Garrett (I'll get to the evidence below and why I think he is definitely guilty).  The issue of race became a central issue, because Potsdam is a largely white community and Nick is a black man.  The defense opted to go with a bench trial instead of a jury trial, and after three weeks, the judge acquitted Nick Hillary.  Since Nick's acquittal, no [new](https://www.nny360.com/news/crime/garrett-phillips-revisited-recent-leads-in-murder-case-fall-flat/article_615185e3-73a4-511c-a287-43c85b845d14.html) leads have turned up anything substantial.  Nick would go on to sue, but [several](https://www.nny360.com/news/several-hillary-claims-tossed/article_0ebd1953-4107-5aaf-ab70-ddaf06eb332d.html) of his claims were [dismissed](https://www.nny360.com/news/stlawrencecounty/former-da-rain-dismissed-from-federal-suit-over-nick-hillary-prosecution/article_7fd37c78-0e8a-57a9-8e42-7074ad77b27e.html).  Some of them are still pending.  

I truly believe Nick Hillary got away with murder.  The biggest piece of evidence against him was surveillance footage from the day of the [murder](https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/videos-show-nick-hillary-day-garrett-phillips-murder-42488444).  At two separate dispositions (Nick Hillary filed a civil suit against the Potsdam police department *before* any criminal charges were filed against him, which opened him up to having to testify at a deposition under oath), Nick admitted that he was driving the silver SUV seen in the Potsdam High School parking lot at 4:47 p.m.  He was a soccer coach and said he was there to scout a soccer game being played.  He never left his vehicle and his view was obstructed by a school bus blocking the soccer field.  He says he never got out of his car because it was pouring down, but video shows multiple people walking around without umbrellas.  After six minutes, he claims to have left the parking lot and turned right to go home.  The actual footage, however, captured Garrett Phillips riding his [skateboard](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/five-year-journey-garrett-phillips-case-n657616) **at the base of the Potsdam High School parking lot**.  Garrett is in the frame for about 16 seconds, and when he disappears from frame, you can clearly see Nick Hillary's car back up and exit the parking lot by going **left in the direction of Garrett's home**.  When confronted with this inconsistency at his second disposition, he says that he turned left to go visit a friend (and one of his assistant soccer coaches) to confirm he would be at practice later that night.  This would have been roughly around 4:55 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The assistant coach, however, says Nick arrived while he was in the middle of a phone call that he placed at 5:21 p.m.

Nick's daughter also claims to have been home with him eating dinner within the timeline of Garrett's murder.  But investigators found where she texted him later that night at around 6:30 p.m. to ask him what they were going to have for dinner.  The investigators did find a fingerprint on the window where Garrett's killer would have escaped which did not match Nick.  It did not match John Jones (the man who Nick's supporters continue to insist is the ""real killer"" despite all evidence to the contrary) nor any of the other suspects, Tandy, Garrett, or Garrett's half-brother.  But Garrett did in fact have DNA found under one of his fingernails.  

The initial DNA testing found a mixture of Garrett's DNA (95%) and an unknown male (5%).  Hillary's DNA matched 6 out of the 6 of 15 alleles that were able to be identified on the unknown DNA profile, which was not enough to conclusively match him.  But it also did not exclude him.  They later ran more advanced testing (which degraded the sample to have no further testing) and were able to identify 9 out of the 15 alleles.  Nick Hillary matched all 9.  A forensic company out of New Zealand, Starmix, took the results of the DNA testing and ran them into a probability matrix which they came up with 1 in 30 million that anyone other than Nick Hillary as being the contributor of the DNA found under Garrett's fingernail.  The judge at Nick's trial excluded all of this evidence prior to the start of Nick's trial.  

Virtually every story featured about this case is always presented in the most favorable light to Nick Hillary.  I have no doubt in my mind that a murderer got off.  I'd like to hear any other opposing theories or information that could potentially change my mind.",Who Killed Garrett Phillips?

More than three decades after an 80-year-old descendant of one of Greenville’s leading legal families was found in her kitchen stabbed to death, prosecutors and police have closed the case, satisfied they unraveled a mystery that haunted two generations of detectives. It took scientific advancements in DNA technology and painstaking detective work to finally name a killer in a brutal murder that stunned Greenville. Alice Haynsworth Ryan died in her Tudor mansion beside Greenville’s Cleveland Park on an October afternoon in 1988.

She was stabbed 37 times. The killer eluded investigators due to a number of missteps, little evidence left behind and a randomness not normally seen at that time in a small Southern city like Greenville

old newspapers were left on her porch. The killer likely did not suspect she was inside. “You just don’t have that type of murder every day,” said Buddy Burgess, one of the detectives who worked on the case in the early years. “Lot of legwork. We worked every angle. We just couldn’t put it together.” One reason: The man now identified as the killer was shot and killed only a few months after Mrs. Ryan was murdered. Now, more than 30 years later, investigators say they have finally pieced together the story of what happened on that fall afternoon.

Greenville native Alice Haynsworth was the daughter of Harry Haynsworth, who founded the law firm that still bears his name. Hers was a life of privilege, growing up in a mansion on North Main Street that is now the Thomas McAfee Funeral Home. Her nephew was Clement Haynsworth, a federal judge whose nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was scuttled during Richard Nixon’s administration. A great-nephew is Knox White, Greenville’s longtime mayor who was a city councilman when Ryan was murdered. She married Joseph Ryan, a New York native, who would take over his family’s textile business in Greenville. They had three children, Joseph Jr., Katherine and Rhoda. On Oct. 8, 1988, Ryan had been a widow for 30 years, living alone in the 7,000-square-foot house she and her husband built on 2 acres not far from downtown Greenville. Suffering from cancer, Ryan had been an inpatient receiving chemotherapy at St. Francis Hospital. Before picking up her mother from the hospital that day, Katherine Stribling ran errands and stopped by Ryan’s house to borrow serving items for a party she was having at her Columbia home. Stribling used a screwdriver to open a stuck cabinet while she was there.

and Stribling left to pick up hot dogs for lunch and a few items from a small grocery near her mother’s house. She was gone for perhaps 40 minutes. When she returned, as she walked toward the house, she saw a piece of glass in the back door was broken. Stribling moved to insert her key into the lock, but the door opened on its own. Then she saw her mother lying on the floor, wounds on her abdomen. Stribling ran back out the door to summon help. THE INVESTIGATION Police and EMS converged on the Ryan house. It soon became apparent EMS was not needed. The elderly woman was dead.

When Knox White arrived, he noticed Ryan’s car was missing, and within an hour, someone reported the car abandoned in the middle of a road, not far from her house. Officers searched the area and in some brush found a screwdriver that had been wiped off, a bloody dish towel from Ryan’s house and a house key. No car key. A few days later, detectives went back to the site and found a knife they believed had been used in the attack, wiped clean. Four of Ryan’s wounds would have been fatal, the autopsy showed. As suspected, she was stabbed with a screwdriver and a knife. There wasn’t much blood despite the savage attack. Authorities came away with one thought: overkill. She had been stabbed many more times than it took to kill her, often a sign of anger, causing them to wonder, did the murderer know Ryan? The police chief at the time, Mike Bridges, told The Greenville News nothing tied the family to the murders. Despite hundreds of hours, months of interviews, the case went cold.

By 1999, Greenville Police were ready to look again. It fell to Greenville Police investigator Buddy Burgess to see if a killer could be identified. “You just don’t get those type of murders every day,” he said recently. “It upset the whole community.” Detectives started fresh. They worked every angle, every lead and just could not put it together. The paperwork on the investigation ultimately would fill four or five storage boxes. Despite the lack of resolution, the case was never closed. In 2017, Greenville’s new police chief Ken Miller formed a cold case unit due to a backlog of more than a dozen unsolved murder cases. Alice Ryan’s case was the first to be investigated. Former Greenville Police Detective Rick Woodall came into it knowing Ryan’s case was among the longest unsolved murders in the city’s history. He knew Joe Ryan, who became a reserve police officer after his mother died. They started by interviewing every officer who had taken part in the earlier investigation and painstakingly went through the evidence boxes. It took months. They called on a forensic investigator from the State Law Enforcement Division to look at the evidence to determine what should be sent to the crime lab for testing. Science had grown into a powerful investigatory tool by then. Investigators were counting on new technology to show them the way. TECHNOLOGY POINTS TO A SUSPECT In early 2018, they elected to send to the crime lab clothing, the screwdriver, the butcher knife and a cigarette butt labeled “debris.” It had been found in Ryan’s car, stored away for decades in a police evidence locker. Alice Ryan’s 1967 Ford Galaxy was missing for about two hours on the day she was murdered. A cigarette butt found inside led investigators to the killer 33 years later. Greenville Police PROVIDED It took months, but DNA on the cigarette matched that of Brian Munns, who lived in Columbia for a time and in Americus, Georgia. He had a record of convictions for larceny, strong arm robbery and criminal sexual conduct and had been in Greenville for a few weeks during that time period around Ryan’s murder. Woodall and retired police lieutenant Don Belue had already interviewed Munns in Georgia. They obtained a warrant for his arrest and charged him with stealing Ryan’s car and accessory after the fact of murder. Once the DNA tests came back, the charge was upgraded to murder. Police also were hearing about a fellow named Lamar Green, who was seen with Munns on the day Ryan was killed. He had a record of burglaries. Green had been a suspect from the early days of the investigation but died a few months after Ryan. His mother-in-law shot him, as he held a gun on family members, including her daughter. Justifiable homicide, police said. Munns was placed in the Greenville County Detention center under a no-bond hold. Months passed. He remained silent. PROVING THE CHARGE Meanwhile, the 13th Circuit Solicitor’s Office prepared for trial. They had witnesses who put Munns in Ryan’s car, and his DNA was found inside it. They told him they were ready to proceed. By early 2021, Munns had fired his first lawyer who told him to keep quiet. His new lawyer encouraged Munns to tell what he knew. At last, Munns told investigators he did ride around with Green on that day in Ryan’s car. Green wanted to sell it to him, he said. Other witnesses saw the two men together in the car in a neighborhood not far from Ryan’s house. Munns said he was not in Ryan’s house, that Green was the murderer. “Based on the evidence, we felt this all made sense,” Deputy Solicitor William McMaster said this month. In September, Munns pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony — or not reporting a crime — and was sentenced to four years. Time served. And with that plea, 33 years after Ryan’s death, police closed the book on their investigation. The police, the family feel some amount of closure, McMaster said. It was a crime of opportunity. Nothing more, nothing less.","33 years after a wealthy SC matron was murdered, police name a killer, close the case"

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of posts about her case already, so I linked the story above to summarize for anyone unaware. I wanted to talk about the dollar bill, supposedly written by Mikelle Biggs, that is suspected to be a hoax. I don't want to claim that it contains any definitive information, but I think the message on the dollar bill may contain a hidden message if it *isn't* fake. A few of the main arguments for the dollar bill being fake are the misspelled name and the handwriting. While I think these are strong reasons to dismiss the dollar bill as a hoax, there are counterarguments such as there not being enough room to write her full name.

""My name is Mikel..."" is not written from corner-to-corner. With handwriting, it can sometimes be tricky to estimate the amount of space you have to write. She may have been using the corners to hold down the bill to write more clearly. Arizona was also abbreviated to ""AZ,"" either to save room, time, or to reduce any irrelevant letters that can possibly construe the hidden message.

There have also been comments saying that the handwriting doesn't match Mikelle's. This bill was printed in 2009, but Mikelle was born in 1987. I don't think the handwriting of an 11-year-old will be similar to that of someone older than 21. Not to mention the stress and pressure of getting a message on a dollar bill and hoping your kidnapper doesn't see you.

What bothered me the most, was how the ""s"" in ""is"" on the right side of the bill looks a lot like the number 5, and is almost written horizontally, rather than vertically like the rest of the words on the left edge of the bill, looking very intentional. The very first ""M"" resembles a 3, and it looks like extra pressure was put on the pen to resemble the number as well.

Some letters in the message are capitalized, while some are not. The very first ""M"" in the message is sharp, while the rest are smooth. Some other capital letters I found were M, S, B, F, two As, and an I. I put these letters in a word unscrambler, but only got ""Mafia,"" and ""Samba.""

The two lowercase ""L""s in the message are used inconsistently. One is cursive, while the other is print. Maybe the second ""L"" is the number 1? For the ""B"" in ""Briggs"" I mentioned earlier, I see either an 8, or a ""B"" with a hidden 3 applied as extra pen pressure.

I also see a lowercase ""e"" as the dot for the ""i"" in ""kidnapped."" But this can probably be explained because a dot above an ""i"" can be written in circular motion. However, I also notice a hidden ""i"" in front of the Arizona abbreviation ""Az."" It looks more like an attempt to fix the letter ""A,"" but these could also be related. But at the same time, these both could be less significant.

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I have so far. I'm going to obsess over the message for a while, but I was hoping to find others who enjoy finding clues and deciphering messages to see if maybe we can find something new in the message.",Clues in Mikelle Biggs' Dollar Bill Message?
293,Environmental_War_62,[],1639687061,"Hello, this is a very sad case I would like to share. Unfortunately there isn't much information online nor any recent updates. 

María Juanita, Nestor and Jordan Logro Choloquinga were three of six children born to Jorge Logro and María Choloquinga. They were seven, five and three years old respectively. The family lived in a rented house in the southern part of Quito (Ecuador's capital), in a neighborhood called Nueva Aurora. I couldn't find the exact details of what happened on the day the kids disappeared (Tuesday 20, August 2013), only that they were alone in their house while their parents went to the market, once Jorge and María came back they found three of their kids were gone. The parents immediately reported this and police started to search areas near the house. Less than a month later, on September 10, the body of Juanita was found inside a bag near a garbage dump in a place called Ciudadela del Ejército, 2 km away from where she lived. The autopsy determined she had been raped and then strangled. No one of the sources I checked mention if police was able to collect DNA from the perpetrator from Juanita's body. Around this time the case gained certain notoriety and even the then President Rafael Correa met with the family. 

On September 19, police announced a suspect had been apprehended in relation with the case. In the official statement, they said this person had contacted the Logro family and claimed to have information about their children, they tracked this person and found they resided in the Santo Domingo province, which is around three hours away from Quito. A news article I found (very short) added that this person was a woman and she had been trying to extort the parents. There is also a news clip that mentions this woman was eventually cleared of any involvement in the case.  

On October 3, not too far from where Juanita's body had been found, inside the Calicanto ravine, the body of Jordan was found. Later that month, on October 30, Nestor's body was also found in a wasteland in the same area. The boy's corpses were in a very advanced state of decomposition and the coroner was not able to determine a cause of death, however the prosecutors confirmed their deaths were being treated as a homicide. Their identities were confirmed via DNA testing because of this same reason. 

On November of the same year, police carried out a search in a house in the Nueva Aurora neighborhood, the article I found doesn't mention why they looked into that particular house, only that luminol tests had been made and the results of this investigation were not made public. 

Juanita, Nestor and Jordan were buried in Saquisili, in their parent's native province of Cotopaxi. The last news article I found about the case is from August 2014, almost a year after the kids originally disappeared from their home. It mentions the case is still open and the parents hadn't had any update from prosecutors about the case. As of today, no one has been charged or arrested in connection to what happened to the Logro siblings.

295,sanjose222,[],1639685096,"In 1975, over a dozen young women, several as young as 14 years old, were murdered and found in canals in South Florida.  Two of these murders, those of Ronnie Gorlin and Elyse Rapp in July 1975, were perpetrated by a man who deflated the victims' tires at the 163rd Street Mall in North Miami Beach.  Both victims were Jewish and both drove cars with ""E"" license plates, indicating that their cars were leased or rented.

These cases have been a passion of mine and I am proud to have written a book about the cases.  I'd like to see if Unresolved Mysteries has any thoughts--

Only one murder, that of Judith Oesterling in January 1975, was solved.  Two detectives who investigated the Flat Tire Murders, whom I interviewed in 2020 both believe, to this day that Ted Bundy killed Rapp and Gorlin.  But Bundy was in Utah in 1975.  Could he have travelled to South Florida in July 1975 and killed these two young women?

I spoke with Kevin Sullivan, author of several Bundy books, who said it was unlikely that Bundy was involved in these murders.  What does Unresolved Mysteries think?  I need your input!

PS: Bundy's first visit to Miami was in 1968 as a delegate to the Republican National Convention for Nelson Rockefeller.

PPS: This is my third attempt to post something in Unresolved Mysteries.  I hope it works! I'm trying my best--

296,sussgotswag,[],1639631845,"Coe was last seen at her home in Petaluma, California on April 29th 1997. Coe, a mother of three, dropped her children off for a visit with their father in Marin County on April 28. Coe was reported missing when her children returned home and found the house empty.

Her two-tone blue 1989 Aerostar van was found in a Napa neighborhood. Janie had been going through tough times after losing her job as the administrator of a retirement home in San Rafael. But a few hours before her disappearance Janie Coe was seen by a friend, who told police she was in a good mood that day, as she had gone to a two-hour training for a new job with a cosmetics company.

It is unclear why Janie's van was found in a Napa residential neighborhood, far from any transit services, as Janie did not like to venture far from home. She left behind her eyeglasses and one of her contact lenses, which she needed to drive. She also left behind a cat that she'd owned for 16 years and all of her clothes and possessions.

Coe's debit card was used by someone other than herself at 6:00 p.m. on the day of her disappearance to withdraw $20 from her bank account. She had been known to lend her debit card to friends, but authorities have been unable to identify the person who used it on the day of her disappearance. The individual is described as a heavyset woman. Police want to question the woman but she’s never been identified. 

Today it was announced that new DNA has been found regarding her case, it has not been released what was found. 

A reward of up to $2,500 is being offered by the Sonoma County Alliance Community Engagement and Safety Rewards Fund for information that leads to an arrest.

297,kepler415,[],1639630614,"In September 9, 2014, kayakers that were in the North Creek just above virgin, found a human skull, according to police. The skull was found a day after a heavy rain flooded the area. When the searchers went back to the area, more remains, including a pelvis, were found.

Former police chief Kurt Wright said he still had a hard time letting go of the mystery of a skull and other human remains that washed up in 2014 following a series of heavy storms.

The state medical examiner determined that the remains belonged to a white man, who was between 35 to 45 years old, was between 5-foot-6 and 6-foot-1, and likely died sometime between 2009 and 2014. The man also had some well healed fractures to his nose and skull and also a poor dental work, according to a press release from Springdale police in 2014.

A report from the medical examiner's office concluded the fractures were caused either by ""a blunt force blow to the right side of the head or the head hitting a blunt object during a fall"".

But there were no reports of missing people in the area. More strange, former police chief Kurth Wright said he doesn't remember any unsolved cases that would match the unidentified skeleton. DNA from the skeletal remains sent to Texas has gotten a hit on any databases, including national systems for missing people. ""It's just not a normal place to find human remains,"" Wright said.

Based on the fractures, Wright believed that ""it's either a suicide or a homicide.""

During that time in 2017, Wright hoped that new leads would be generated by publicly talking about the case again, one that he said he wants to get closure for both the victim's family and himself. Wright also retired from police after 30 years from work.

Apart from that, I couldn't find much on this John Doe. However there was a Websleuths user named YaYa\_521 (I don't know if I can link Websleuths website because of its infame in this subreddit) that mentioned the case of Randall Craig Irvin who disappeared in December 16, 2011 from Hurricane, Washington County in Utah. Hurricane is approximately 45 minutes from Virgin, Utah where the remains of John Doe was located. Though YaYa\_521 said they didn't found ""any reference to prior head or nose injuries nor can I see his teeth to try to determine whether he'd fit the ""poor dental work"" description"" but specualted the injuires could have happened after his disappearance in 2011. They said they would submit Irvin for a comparison.

The Charley Project says that Irvin is a ""Caucasian male. Blond hair, blue eyes. Irvin may have a goatee. He is balding."" The website also says that Irving left all his personal belongings behind at home and has never been heard from again. He was an avid outdoorsman at the time of his disappearances. Unfortunately few details are available on his case.

One important thing to notice in Irvin had an history of suicidal ideation. Kurth Wright believed that the John Doe might have died from suicide. With very few details on Irvin case, it's hard to form a theory. However, given the circumstances that Irvin was an outdoorsman, could it be possible that he was exploring the North Creek area to make sure that nobody would find him there should he die? Or could he simply get lost during his outdoor activities?

John Doe had an estimated age of 35 to 45 years old, while Irvin was 51 years old. One thing to note that the Irvin's theory may be incorret is that the fact John Doe could have died in 2009, and Irvin disappeared in 2011. If it wasn't Irvin, then it was a transient who happened to be at the North Creek?

I hope this John Doe can get identified and the family get closure. Also, I don't think Irvin is still alive, given his suicidal ideations, but I hope that his family can get closure if his body is found.

He was famously wearing a spiderman suit at the time of his disappearance and had been playing at his foster grandmother's house when he vanished. His foster mother stated that he was playing outside while she made tea briefly, and she  noticed it went quiet. She went out to check on William but he was nowhere to be found. 

LE theories ranged from abduction to paedophile rings, and a local washing machine repairman was investigated. 

There are several posts here on reddit far more detailed about his actual disappearance, including posts on discrepancies in the case such as photo time stamps not matching up, and a neighbour reporting seeing a car speed off with a child wearing a spiderman costume in the back. 

Fast forward, and just recently charges were brought against William Tyrells foster parents for alleged assault on a child (not William, possibly his sister who remained in their care).  A search was instigated in and around the (now deceased) foster grandmother's property and her old car. 
 
After the hype and the promise from LE to figure out what happened to William, its disheartening to hear that they are finishing up with this latest search at the foster grandmothers house.

[Delphine Jubillar](https://images.lindependant.fr/api/v1/images/view/61b8bebb3e45463854022286/large/image.jpg?v=1) was a nurse, she was 33 when she disappeared. Since 2013, she was married to [Cedric Jubillar](https://images.ladepeche.fr/api/v1/images/view/61b6fd208fe56f7f72314d14/large/image.jpg?v=4), a drywall painter worker. They had two children together.

In the summer of 2020, Delphine Jubillar announces her desire for a divorce. According to her lawyer, the divorce seemed to be carried out by mutual agreement.

On December 16, 2020 in the early morning, Cédric Jubillar, worried, call the police of Cagnac-les-Mines, a french commune of 2,600 inhabitants. Woken up around 4 a.m. by one of his children, he notices that his wife Delphine has disappeared. According to his words, his wife left wearing her white puffer jacket and with her cell phone. She was said to have gone out to walk the couple's two dogs who returned home alone around 4 a.m. waking up the husband. A neighbor then reportedly testified that she saw the 33-year-old nurse in the street between two and four in the morning. Cédric Jubillar sounded the alert on September 16 at 4:30 a.m.

Despite a major search device deployed in the days following the disappearance of Delphine Jubillar, no trace of the nurse could be identified. Beyond human resources, with around fifty policeman and divers used for this search, the police used a helicopter and a drone to try to locate her.

During the night, the behavior of Cédric Jubillar put question the police. When the police arrived there in the middle of the night, the husband was throwing a washing machine with the duvet used by his wife who was sleeping on the bed. (he will explain that the dogs have dirtied it with mud) while the condition of the house was neglected. The pedometer on Cédric Jubillar's phone shows that he took only 40 steps before calling the police, which shows ""a summary search"", according to the magistrate. Thus, the tour of the house and the garden with the police will have constituted more than 380 steps on his phone.

His eagerness to contact the police only about 15 minutes after he woke up has been questioned. He tries to reach his wife 180 times until 10 a.m. on the morning of his disappearance, then the next morning (December 17) twice, then no more calls will be made.

Delphine Jubillar's phone disappears with her. He stopped broadcasting on the morning of December 16 within a radius of 2 km around her home. Her phone turned for the last time at 10:55 p.m. (then goes to voicemail at 7:48 a.m.); he then triggers a relay close to home but which is not the relay to which he usually limits when Delphine is at home. The flashlight on Delphine's phone was never turned on that night, when the street was not lit, it was pitch dark, and she disappeared without her vehicle. However, on January 13, 2021, an empty message was posted from her Facebook account (she is the only one who have access to it). Three hypotheses are put forward: that of a bug in the application, hacking or even a malfunction resulting from investigators' investigations into the computer equipment of the missing person. The hypothesis of piracy would have been favored by the police too.

On February 9, the phone seemed to be reactivated again (more precisely the Messenger application16) without there again a single explanation being able to be put forward.

During the press conference of June 18, 2021, it was specified by the prosecutor that these reactivations would be a technical consequence of the computer searches of the investigators, which was confirmed to them by Samsung.

In the process of divorce with Cédric Jubillar, Delphine had a romantic relationship with another man. The man in question confided in an interview with a newspaper that the story between him and Delphine had started on the Internet ""six months before his disappearance"". He also said that he and Delphine Jubillar were planning to move in together and that the night she disappeared shortly before 11 p.m., she sent him a picture of her ""in nightgown, showered and ready to go to bed."" Then, The outfit will be found during the first search in the dirty laundry bin.

Delphine Jubillar's car was also part of the investigation. According to the testimonies of the neighbors, the vehicle was moved during the night, since it was in forward gear, while Delphine Jubillar always put it in reverse gear in the evening so as to be ready to leave the next morning. In addition, traces of condensation were found in the car. However, no trace of blood was found in the house or in the vehicle in question.

The same night, around 11 p.m, the cries of a woman, supposedly the ones of Delphine, were heard by two witnesses (two neighbors of the couple), corroborating the testimony of the eldest of the family, aged 6Y, who heard a violent argument between his parents that same evening.

Cédric Jubillar has been arrested on June 18, 2021 for aggravated murder. According to the public prosecutor, ""it has been established that it is a disappearance which is unlikely to be voluntary"". Relying on the profile of Delphine Jubillar, who was planning to divorce her husband to settle down with a new companion, who loved her job and who had made plans for the future, the trail of suicide or voluntary disappearance has been ruled out.

The divorce between Cédric and Delphine Jubillar ""gave rise to a lot of arguments between them. Cédric Jubillar had great difficulty accepting this separation"" and ""tried to win back"" his wife, but in a brutal way to say the least. Thus, he had organized a real surveillance of his wife, going to her account to see if she had made any expenses, being very intrusive on the way in which his wife organized her separation"", reported the prosecutor. 

Cédric Jubillar has been described as someone who ""could be brutal, rude, aggressive"" ""including towards his children"".

What happened to her ?"
300,gaycatdetective,[],1639605090,"On December 23, 2004, a decomposed skeleton was discovered by children in a barn near a wooded area near Tyler, Texas. At the time, all that could be determined was that it was a white male between 27 and 42 years old, and he had died earlier that year. 

DNA Doe Project announced that he has been identified as Kim Ryan Casey. Kim was apparently homeless and traveling, and was last known to be living in Coppell, Texas. Coppell is about 100 miles away from Tyler. Not much else is known about him at this time. He would have been 52 at the time of his death. There are no indications of criminal activity and authorities believe he died of natural causes due to the risks associated with being homeless and cold weather in the area around the time he died. 

DDP took on the case in 2019 after investigators had exhausted all investigative avenues. Bacteria contamination of the DNA sample and endogamy in portions of the family tree complicated the case, but Kim was identified as a potential match in August 2019 and confirmed last month. The NAMUS page was removed at that time. 

Other potential difficulties in identifying him could be that a photo provided of Kim shows he was balding, but a sketch was not created until sixteen years later, in2020, and it depicted him with a full head of long hair. He also had no personal items with him. It is unclear to me whether or not he was ever reported missing by anyone or not.

302,Apache1One,[],1639589475,"[Ruth Peck](https://imgur.com/a/IWOUl9Q) was an 81 year old Philadelphia woman who lived at 4712 Devereaux Street in the city’s Wissinoming neighborhood. Not much information is available for this case, the potential crime scene no longer exists (the homes on her block were demolished in the late 1990s), and no one knows for sure what caused [Ruth’s death](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/119978204/ruth-e-peck/photo), but considering the details, it is a fascinating case, so I figured I’d write something up with whatever information I could find. I grew up not far from here and had not heard of this case before I stumbled upon the [Ruthless podcast](www.ruthlessthepod.com) on Instagram (at ruthlessthepod).

Ruth Peck had not been heard from much on November 29, 1993. Since this was unusual, as Ruth interacted with family several times a day, a neighbor was asked to check on her. The neighbor found the front door unlocked and Ruth lying in her bed, lethargic and barely responsive. 

Later at the hospital, it was discovered that Ruth had a wound on the back of her head that suggested she fell into or was struck by a pointed object. Her son Joe states that the only sharp corner in the house that she could have fallen into was in her basement laundry room. He believes that she was struck, as she would not likely have been able to get to her bedroom herself due to her wounds as well as her severe arthritis. On January 23, 1994, Ruth Peck succumbed to her injuries. 

The autopsy report lists “accident” as the manner of death, “after she presumably fell, striking the back of her head.” However, page five of the report contains a note from a doctor stating “while in the hospital, she told a member of the staff that somebody hit her over the back of the head, but she didn’t know who.” A few pages further, a note from one of the doctors who treated her reads that he was “of the opinion that she was mugged.” 

Despite these assertions, it seems no police investigation took place, aside from a cursory visit to Ruth’s house. 

Her family believes there are two potential suspects. The first is a man who grew up in the house next door and remained there for a time after his parents died. He was suffering from drug addiction, and after his parents died, he sold much of what he could, down to the studs and then moved away. Ruth’s son believes he and the associates that were living with him were also engaging in petty crimes for cash. Right around the time of the attack, he re-emerged and stopped at Ruth’s home. They’d not seen one another in years. He invited her to Thanksgiving at his home, but she declined. Joe believes that if this neighbor attacked Ruth, the house would have been ransacked. He died several years ago. 

The second was Joe’s brother in law, his sister’s husband. Apparently the brother in law never got along with the family and was physically abusive with the sister on at least one occasion when Joe was present. The brother in law claimed health issues and did not work. Joe’s sister and husband moved into Ruth’s home after she died in 1994. While it is not known what could have precipitated an altercation between Ruth and the brother in law, there was animosity between the two. She would have opened the door to her home if he showed up on her doorstep, and more importantly, Tina, Ruth’s German Shepard would not need to be locked up if the brother in law visited because the dog was familiar with him. Joe believes his brother in law may have used a slag hammer Ruth kept to hit her over the head and then placed her in her bed before leaving and discarding the weapon. The brother in law died in October 2020, and his family denied knowing Ruth or anything about a hammer found amongst his possessions. 

So what happened? Was Ruth the victim of an unfortunate accident? Or was it a violent crime met with the indifference of a notoriously corrupt Philly Police Department due to Ruth’s advanced age?

The podcast is very well done and has much more detail than I could fit here, including interviews with members of Ruth’s family. I’d highly recommend listening.","The Mysterious Death of Ruth Peck, Philadelphia 1994"

Mr Draper’s vehicle was later located at Leppington on Monday 17 September 2001, unlocked and undamaged, dumped outside a Rebels bikie clubhouse. It had been wiped clean, leaving detectives with no forensic evidence. A forensic examination of the vehicle was conducted; however, no further evidence was obtained.

Police confirmed that Mr Draper had not used or accessed his phone or bank accounts since his disappearance.

No one has been charged in relation to Mr Draper’s disappearance, and his body has never been located.

Police believe he was killed after witnessing a murder. The only possible explanation for Mr Draper's disappearance was a fatal bashing he witnessed while working at a Liverpool pub in 1995. Mr Draper was subsequently a Crown witness during the trial. He gave evidence against underworld figure Andrew Perish. Perish was cleared of that murder, but he and brother Anthony went on to plot and dismember police informant Terry Falconer.

307,PM_ME_YOUR_DALEKS,[],1639530675,"There are many misconceptions regarding ""mysteries"" which involve the outdoors and different terrain. This summer there was yet another case which has prompted conspiracy theories and many comments of denial. Based on the newly released records and my experience as a hiker, I wanted to collect and rebut some of the myths about this ""mystery.""

**Background**
On Sunday, August 15, 2021, Ellen Chung, 31, Jonathan Gerrish, 45, their daughter, Aurelia ""Miju"" Chung-Gerrish, 1, and dog, Oski, left for a hike along the three-mile long Savage-Lundy Trail, in an area known as Devil's Gulch in the Sierra National Forest. They did not notify anyone of their plans that Sunday, though both adults texted on other, non-hiking matters up to the day prior. The last person to see the family in person on August 13, two days prior to their hike, was their unnamed nanny. 

Gerrish mapped the Sunday hike using the common app AllTrails that weekend. He had last hiked it himself in May 2017. The family were seen arriving at the trailhead in their vehicle around 7:45 a.m. on Sunday when the temperature was 76 degrees. Within three hours, the temperature rose to 99 and hit a peak of 109 that afternoon. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Gerrish was dressed in dark shorts, a yellow T-shirt and tennis shoes. Chung wore brown hiking boots, spandex shorts and a yellow tank top. The baby, dressed in a short-sleeved onesie and pink shoes, was strapped into a backpack on Gerrish’s back. 

No other witnesses have come forward as hiking the trail that day, so the family had the trail to themselves. I have read comments on forums that regular hikers in that area knew to avoid that trail in summer due to the hazardous heat, which would account for no other help being available. (The person who saw the family's truck drive by in the morning was walking her dog on the nearby road that leads to the trail parking lot, not on the trail). 

On Monday, August 16 at 11:00 am, the nanny arrived back at the Chung-Gerrish home for work and was surprised to find the family and their vehicle gone. The adults' wallets and cell phones were in the house, as was their regular diaper bag that they usually carried everywhere. The nanny called the couple's construction manager (they owned several properties in the area they were remodeling/renting). At first it was assumed the family had left on an errand, or perhaps to visit one of their properties. After friends called and drove around searching for the family without success, the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office was alerted at about 11:00 pm.

On the morning of Tuesday, August 17, authorities found the family's vehicle parked at the trailhead and proceeded to search the trail. Shortly after, the bodies of Gerrish, the baby and the dog were discovered together about 1.6 miles below the trailhead, on a series of steep switchbacks. The keyfob to their Ford truck was found about 100 feet below Gerrish, indicating he'd perhaps dropped it or thrown it. 

About an hour later, a deputy found disturbed dirt up the hill from Gerrish, the baby and the dog, as if someone had tried to crawl up the hill to the trailhead. He then found a shoe and finally the body of Chung about 13 feet from her family. The trail was shut down and, after authorities spent the day and night guarding the scene, the California Highway Patrol was able to airlift the bodies off the trail the next morning. 

Authorities used maps to locate any possible abandoned mine shafts in the area for toxic fumes, however there were none. There was no indication that the family had drunk from the nearest body of water, the Merced River, however authorities did test the water in it. They did find two different types of anatoxin-a, a neurotoxin, but that is a toxin that has never proven fatal to humans, only dogs who have ingested several liters. The drops of water remaining in the couple's empty water carrier were tested and were found to be tap water, so if they were aware of the river they could not get to it. Authorities even investigated the bodies and ground for indications of a fluke lightning strike. There was no indication of foul play. Autopsies determined the family died from hyperthermia and dehydration.

**Comments I've seen about the case**
*All living things do not succumb to heat at the same rate. A dog, a baby, and two adults would not die in the same place at the same time.*

There is no indication they succumbed at the same time. Chung was found about 13 feet up the hill from the rest of the family, with marks in the dirt indicating she had dragged herself up the hill, trying to get to the trailhead before succumbing. Sadly, hyperthermia impacts children at a rate three to five times faster than adults, so the baby likely started dying first. That would have panicked the parents and likely made them push themselves even more in the heat. It looks like when the baby started to die, they tried to push on until Gerrish (carrying the baby) could no longer go on either, so he stayed with the dog and the baby while Chung tried to go for help herself, before finally dying. 

*There was a full bottle of baby formula and water in the canteen.*
 
False. There were two empty sippy cups in the backpack found on Gerrish, one of which had formula residue in it. Chung had a 2.5 liter Osprey Hydraulics LT water bladder on her which was also empty, save for a few drops authorities were able to test (showing the water was clean and free of toxins). The Forest Service recommends for a hike like this at least 160 ounces of water per adult, 16 ounces for a baby and 16 ounces for a dog. The couple brought only 82 ounces of water total and likely went through that (plus the cup of formula) quickly. The only water source nearby was the Merced River, but there's no indication they were even aware of it.

*The couple were experienced hikers.*

This was repeated often in the press but there is nothing to back that up. They did enjoy occasional hikes but were not survivalists. When authorities interviewed friends, the construction manager had a low opinion of Gerrish's outdoor abilities (implying somewhat he was a city boy who tended to be easily bowled over by outdoor work). Gerrish's AllTrails app history showed that he had last hiked this same trail four year prior, in the spring when the weather was more temperate (and before wildfires had destroyed the trees). 

*The two adults could not have just suddenly lost all their senses in an instant.*

Confusion is one of the hallmarks of heat exhaustion/hyperthermia. Due to the temps, they likely started experiencing symptoms by late morning/midday. Once the baby started to succumb, that would have panicked them further. Without a cell signal, they would have realized that their only option was to try and get back to their vehicle. They were probably trying to go back during the peak of the heat in the afternoon, which would have made it worse. Resting would not have been an option for the adults when the baby was dying and needed rescue urgently. 

*They could have called for help. *

A cell phone was found in Gerrish's pocket, however that area has very poor cell reception. Authorities have tried but so far have been able to unlock the phone to see if there were any attempts made to call for help. 

*Their instinct would be to protect the child, whether under a shrub with its clothes off, pouring creek water on it, and at very least not holding the child close as it was found with the father. *

There was no shade on the trail due to the Ferguson Fire of 2018 which had burned off the tree canopy. The nearest water was the Merced River, which there was no indication they were aware of. The instinct would have been to get the baby medical help, not try and treat her on the trail. 

As for not holding the baby close because of body heat, there is little chance you could convince a parent to not offer physical comfort to their dying child. 

Here are some photos and a description of walking the trail in March 2015. Note this is before the wildfires destroyed the tree cover and even then, the writer notes they would never walk this trail in the summer:
https://sierranewsonline.com/hiking-on-the-savage-lundy-trail/

Then realize the family hiked this same trail in August, with all that shade cover gone. 

*The dog would have survived.* 

Oski was a Aussie-Akita mix, a dog bred for cold weather with a thick coat. He was also wearing a metal collar which would have conducted heat. We can presume that the couple, once they realized their dire lack of water, probably focused on giving it to the baby first so the dog likely got very little, if any. 

**What can this tragedy teach us?**
* Always, always know the area you're hiking in. Just because you visited an area some time before doesn't mean it has remained the same. Check with locals and those who actually live in the area. 
* Check the weather forecast and temps for the ENTIRE day(s), not just the time you expect to be on your hike. Realize that if something goes wrong you will be there beyond your forecasted window. Don't try to ""beat"" the weather. 
* Do not rely only on a cell phone in an emergency, which may not work in wilderness areas. 
* Always tell people where exactly you're going and when they can expect you back. Agree on a timeframe in which a trusted person will alert authorities if they've not heard from you. Whatever amount of water you think you'll need, take more. 
* Do not take children on hikes without being aware of their needs. Even if a baby isn't walking, they are still so small that the sun and temps will impact them much more quickly than an adult.

Five inches of fresh snow had fallen during the day of December 24, 1909, in the county of Powys, Wales. That evening at the farm of Owen Thomas and his family there was a happy Christmas Eve gathering with friends in attendance; everyone was roasting chestnuts and singing carols, and generally enjoying themselves. In attendance was not just the Thomases, but also several friends including the local minister and his wife.

        Around 11:00 PM, Mr. Thomas asked his 11-year-old son Oliver to fetch some more water from the well, as the bucket was getting low and it was a sure bet that the guests would still need more water to drink. Oliver put on his boots and overcoat, took the bucket, and walked out to get the water.

        Less than ten seconds later, the mood of the party was shattered by Oliver's screams for help.

        The minister grabbed a paraffin lantern as the group ran out the door to assist... but Oliver was nowhere to be seen. He could, however, still be heard; from somewhere above the groups' heads, Oliver screamed ""They've got me! They've got me!"" They flashed the lantern upwards, but could only see the black, starless sky... Oliver kept screaming, but the sound grew fainter and fainter. Eventually, the call faded away altogether.

        The snow in front of the group didn't help explain what happened. The deep new snow clearly displayed Oliver's footprints leading from the house towards the well; but about seventy-five feet away from the house, the tracks simply stopped. The wooden bucket was found about fifteen feet away from the last footprint in the snow. There were no other tracks or signs in the fresh snow to explain what happened.

        The following day saw the arrival of police officials from the nearby town of Rhayader, who formed a search party and scoured the countryside. The well was probed with grappling hooks; all who attended the party were fully interrogated... the simple evidence of Oliver's tracks in the snow told a story the police were not able to believe, so they attempted to find any other possible explanation for the boy's disappearance. But the evidence all pointed to the one impossible conclusion: Oliver had gone up, by means unknown... and that was all that could be said.

        No bird known in Wales -- or anywhere else -- is capable of lifting an eleven-year-old boy; and an airplane, which had only been properly invented about four years earlier, would have been easily heard over the boy's screams. Oliver was never seen again.

        Who, then, were the mysterious '*they*' that Oliver screamed about?

She didn’t have a hostile bone in her body,” Doris said of Alice. “She was very sensitive.”’ [Alice Looney](https://uncovered.com/cases/alice-ida-looney) adored spending time with her nieces and nephews. She was a sister, aunt, cousin and friend. Growing up, Alice experienced bullying and struggled with depression as a result. 

**The last time Alice is seen.** On August 16, 2004, Alice ran into her sister, Mary and her husband at Legends Casino in Toppenish, Washington. Alice asked if they could take her to Wapato and drop her off at a nearby Roadrunner gas station. [Mary had warned her sister to be careful and remembered that Alice said she’d be cautious, and that she only had $20 in her pocket.](https://uncovered.com/cases/alice-ida-looney) 

However, it would be a few days before Mary would discover that Alice was missing because it wasn’t unusual for Alice to leave without giving any family or friends notice. Often for extended periods of time. Alice didn’t drive, so occasionally she would hitchhike. There were multiple alleged sightings of Alice with an unidentified man throughout Wapato.

**When she was discovered.** OnNovember 30, 2005, after searching for over a year, Alice’s remains were discovered by a hunter on a small island underneath a log in Satus Creek 23 miles from where she was last seen. An autopsy was done by forensic pathologists; however, they were unable to determine her cause of death. The examiner did note it is likely that the cause of death was “probable strangulation” [but didn’t have enough evidence to determine because of how much time elapsed since she went missing](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/we-just-want-to-know-what-happened-questions-remain-in-mysterious-death-of-yakama-woman/article_33515455-344f-58a5-afa6-f13973d91cab.html). 

In 2007, the [FBI took jurisdiction over Alice’s case along ](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/seattle/press-releases/2009/se050609-1.htm)with 15 other Native American women who went missing or were murdered near the Yakima Reservation in Washington. This investigation lasted two years and the findings were released in May 2009; 10 of the cases were homicides, 2 were accidental drownings, one was due to hypothermia. Meanwhile, Alice’s case was determined inconclusive. The investigation revealed that these deaths were not connected, nor was a serial killer involved

**Where the case stands today.**  Alice’s case is still unsolved, and her family still actively fights for answers. Were you near the Legends Casino, in Toppenish, Washington on August 16, 2004?

311,eastofliberty,[],1639500394,"Toronto police have released video footage of a suspect who was seen on camera walking near the Sherman property for a ""suspicious amount of time"" at the time police believe the couple was murdered.
Police released the footage Tuesday four years after the 75-year-old founder of Canadian pharmaceutical company Apotex and his 70-year-old wife, who were among the country’s most well-known philanthropists, were murdered at their home on Old Colony Road.

Their bodies were discovered on the morning of Friday, Dec. 15, 2017 by a realtor who was showing the home to prospective buyers.

Speaking at a news conference at Toronto police headquarters on Tuesday morning. Det.- Sgt. Brandon Price told reporters that numerous peopl  were spotted on camera in the neighbourhood near the Sherman's property around the time of the murder, and with the exception of this one suspect, police have been able to identify all of those individuals.

""This individual's actions are highly suspicious,"" Price told reporters Tuesday, adding that the suspect stay in a ""defined area"" near the Sherman's property for some time.

Price did not rule out the possibility that this person could have a legitimate reason for being outside the Sherman home at the time of the murder but said they were around the property for a ""suspicious amount of time.""

Police have previously confirmed to the public that they have identified ""persons of interest"" in the case but this is the first time investigators have used the term ""suspect.""

In this case, it was just eleven teeth found, all believed to be from the same child, in a yard on F street. While one poster immediately thought of the skull found six years later, I immediately thought of Dorothea Puente and looked up the address of her house. Sure enough, it was the house right next door. Then I saw the found date matched up to when she was making headlines. 

Off to googling “Dorothea Puente Teeth” led me to another article that mentioned most of her victims were found without teeth, and two dozen teeth were thrown into her neighbor’s yard. 

So there you have it, there’s half a mouthful of an unidentified child’s teeth that almost certainly have something to do with Dorothea Puente. But whose teeth are they?

313,AlteredSportsHistory,[],1639455504,"Back in August 2016, when the concept of Instagram influencers was fairly new, a young Instagrammer from Paris named Louise Delage started gaining attention and notoriety with her colorful posts seemingly depicting a glamorous lifestyle. Delage was shown dancing at nightclubs, posing on yachts, eating at expensive restaurants—typical high-end influencer activities. Between her apparently trendy lifestyle, her stylish clothes, and—to be perfectly honest—[obvious good looks](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/who-louise-delage-troubling-truth-behind-overnight-instagram-success-173792/), Delage attracted over 66,000 followers in less than a month and a half.

However, one day Delage’s Instagram was abruptly cleared of all its pictures, replaced only by a brief silent film. The film showed in rapid succession all of her previous pictures, then asked the viewer what all the photos had in common. The commonality—which almost nobody had picked up on until then—was that every single one of her pictures showed Delage with some kind of alcoholic beverage: a glass of wine here, a cocktail there, even a bottle or two of champagne. “Louise Delage”, the film revealed, was actually an anti-alcoholism campaign composed by the French ad agency BETC for a charity called Addict Aide, which revealed how “normal” it might be for someone to be hiding their alcoholism in plain sight.

The “Like My Addiction” campaign, as it was known, was considered a huge success for both the ad agency, which won several awards in both North America and Europe, and for Addict Aide, which received a huge amount of publicity for its work. Remember, this was back in 2016, when Instagram was fairly new and people weren’t as cynical about influencers as they are now. Articles like [this one from Branding Mag](https://www.brandingmag.com/2016/10/02/good-campaign-of-the-week-addict-aide-like-my-addiction/) and [this from Medium](https://medium.com/@shuyi.wong/like-my-addiction-by-betc-4cf01974dc1a) lavished praise on both BETC and the campaign. 

And it seemed that “Like My Addiction” might not be the last word from either the campaign or Louise Delage herself. Later interviews with the creators of the campaign suggested that a future campaign might focus on Delage in rehab, and a longer film was said to be potentially on the table. However, after 2017, chatter about the campaign and Louise Delage seemed to stop entirely. All the creators of the project seemed to move on to other things…including the model who portrayed “Louise Delage”. 

Curiously, even after the big reveal, the creators of the campaign never mentioned who Louise Delage actually was. None of the articles mentioned a name, and nobody seemed to even ask the question. It seemed strange that someone who had received so much publicity on Instagram, so fast, could vanish just as quickly without anyone knowing who she was…or without anyone even seeming interested in who she was.

I was thinking about this campaign the other day when I saw another internet anti-alcoholism campaign. I thought by now that “Louise Delage”’s identity would have been revealed by now, and maybe she went on to some other acting or modeling career. But there have been almost no articles about the campaign since 2017, and none of the articles mentioned anything. So I started writing this post to ask the question….

…and then, just as I was almost finished writing this, I Googled “Louise Delage imdb” out of curiosity.

[Hmmmm.](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5041601/)

I mean…that’s got to be her, right? It certainly looks like her. And the IMDB profile describes somebody who would have a little bit of acting and modeling experience and a lot of experience putting together photo shoots—in other words, exactly the sort of person who could have put together dozens of influencer Instagram pictures in a short amount of time.

But on the other hand…if you’re trying to put together a mysterious Instagram campaign where the whole idea is to depict an anonymous “could be anyone” person on the internet, wouldn’t the last name you pick be the *actual name* of the person in the photographs? And why the continued secrecy? IMDB profiles usually include *everything* somebody has been involved in. Surely the “Like My Addiction” campaign would have be part of her profile, especially considering that the campaign ended with a brief, but award-winning film...and surely, now that the ""real"" Louise Delage is a rising star herself with costume design credits on *The French Dispatch* and *Boite Noire*, that connection would be out in the open?

So, like the Instagram influencer’s alcoholism, was Louise Delage hiding in plain sight all this time? Or is there another surprise behind the glamour?","Who was “Louise Delage”, the Instagram influencer who was later revealed to be the subject of an anti-alcoholism campaign?"

316,cryptenigma,[],1639426198,"Short summary: police find body of Mississippi woman missing since 2007 after her brother-in-law confessed to her murder, and revealed where he hid the body, prior to his execution for estranged wife, Kim Cox.

From https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/remains-found-after-pre-execution-tip-from-mississippi-man/ :

""On Sunday, police discovered what’s believed to be the body of Felicia Cox on land that had once belonged to her family in Pontotoc County. The remains will be taken to the state crime lab for an autopsy and DNA testing to confirm identity, according to Pontotoc County Coroner Kim Bedford.

Last month, David Neal Cox became the first inmate executed in Mississippi in nine years, put to death for killing his estranged wife, Kim Kirk Cox, and sexually assaulting her young daughter as her mother lay dying. Cox pleaded guilty in 2012 to capital murder for the May 2010 shooting death. He also pleaded guilty to multiple other charges, including sexual assault.

Cox had dropped his appeals, filing court papers calling himself “worthy of death” before the state Supreme Court set his execution date.

Questions had remained about whether David Cox was responsible for the 2007 disappearance of Felicia Cox, his brother’s wife, who was last seen in a neighboring county...Before his Nov. 17 execution, David Cox told his attorneys he killed Felicia Cox in 2007, providing detailed instructions on where investigators could find her remains and waiving his attorney-client privilege after death, according to John Weddle, the district attorney for several northern Mississippi counties.

The information was presented to Weddle’s office two days after Cox’s execution, the district attorney said last week, adding that David Cox has been a longtime suspect in his sister-in-law’s disappearance.

'Our office is greatly indebted to many as we reflect on the discovery of what appears to be the remains of Felicia Cox today in Pontotoc County,' Weddle said Sunday in a statement posted to his official Facebook page. 'We are thankful the family can now begin the process of giving Felicia Cox a burial.'

318,annemoriarty,[],1639411516,"- Hypothesis on the alleged instigators


The investigations subsequently led to hypothesize the existence of instigators of the crimes. This hypothesis is based on some statements by Giancarlo Lotti (who declared in the trial that the body parts were bought by an unknown ""doctor"") and on the discovery of a possible esoteric symbol, a pyramid trunk of colored granite, about fifteen centimeters long, found a few meters from the lifeless bodies of the couple killed in October 1981. However, it should be remembered that this object is often used as a doorstop in the Tuscan countryside. Other alleged evidence of a possible magical-esoteric motive occurred on the occasion of the last crime; a few days before being murdered the two victims had camped in the Calenzano area but were asked to leave by a gamekeeper, as free camping was not allowed in that area. Later the same gamekeeper found, not far from the place where the two had camped for the first time, three stone circles, two of which were open and one closed and conteined berries, burnt animal skins and wooden crosses. However, the episode of the gamekeeper was recently disputed. In fact, the presence of the couple in Calenzano didn't appear from the receipts that the couple used to keep during their travels; furthermore, all possible sightings of the French couple deserve reflection and the benefit of the doubt. This is due to the fact that the photo of the French victim that ended up in the newspapers showed the woman with very short hair, while in September '85 Nadine had long hair.
Moreover, the frequentations of Pacciani and Vanni during the years of the murders fueled a stream of inquiry into possible esoteric motives and rites linked to Satanism. In particular, Pacciani and Vanni frequented a man called Salvatore Indovino, a magician and fortune teller originally from Catania. They usually spent time together at a farmhouse located in the countryside of San Casciano, where, according to many, orgies and rites connected to occultism were consumed. During the searches carried out by the State Police at Pacciani's home, at least three books were found that can be linked to black magic and Satanism. The so-called esoteric lead is also linked to the large sums of money that Pacciani came into possession during the years of the crimes, from which the idea was born that the ""snack companions"" acted on behalf of unknown personalities interested in deriving ""fetishes"" from mutilated bodies. Pacciani, a modest farmer, came to have 157 million lire (corresponding, in 1996, to 117,069.52 euros in 2018) in cash and interest-bearing postal bonds, as well as having bought a car, two houses and renovated completely his home.
The investigation carried out by the State Police showed that Pacciani, before the crimes attributable to the Monster, was in economically modest conditions and did not inherit assets that could justify the sums of money considered (but not by all) too large and sudden for a simple farmer. Mario Vanni also came to have important figures, albeit to a much lower extent. Those who do not believe in the instigators hypotesys point out that the farmer, in addition to renting an apartment, carried out many illegal jobs and was known for his stinginess. Furthermore, the alleged accomplice Lotti was far from rich since in the eighties and nineties he found jobs and accommodation only thanks to the help of the village priest, being in effect a destitute unemployed person. Vanni, despite the figures found on his accounts, died in a modest retirement home in the province. The esoteric motive is thus dismissed by many investigators.


The sentences condemning the ""snack companions"" are mainly based on the discussed testimonies of Pucci and, above all, of Lotti. This prevented the identification of a certain, organic motive that was valid for all crimes. In fact Lotti, before mentioning the mysterious ""doctor"", had changed his version several times on the reasons why Pacciani and Vanni had killed. Lotti initially declared in 1996 ""that the crimes had been acts of anger over sexual approaches that the victims would have rejected"". Then, a year later, he provided another version of the motive, stating that Pacciani's will was to kill and then feed the ""fetishes"" to his daughters.  The debate on Lotti's reliability remains open in public opinion, despite the fact that he was decisive in obtaining definitive judicial sentences on the matter. In 2010 Pier Luigi Vigna, former prosecutor of Florence who dealt with the case, declared himself skeptical about the existence of possible instigators. Piero Tony, deputy attorney general at the appeal trial against Pacciani, also was skeptical of the  hypothesis.
But from a legal standpoint the mystery of the Monster of Florence was officially resolved.


- Suspect: Francesco Narducci 


Francesco Narducci was a doctor and university professor, he belonged to one of the wealthiest and most prominent families of Perugia. He died in Lake Trasimeno at the age of 36, on October 13, 1985, a few weeks after the last crime of the Monster of Florence. His death, at the time, was filed as a accidental drowning and the body was buried without an autopsy. It has been hypothesized that he was responsible for the crimes, on the basis of a retracted testimony of a maid who allegedly saw him write a confession asking for forgiveness and in recent times on the basis of one of the controversial ""spontaneous declarations"" of the criminal Angelo Izzo. Maybe he was one of the leaders of the mysterious ""sect"" that allegedly commissioned the murders. His involvement was initially based on the wiretapping of a group of criminals who allegedly threatened a woman called ""Dora"", tellinge her that they would ""do to her the same thing they did to the doctor killed in Lake Trasimeno "" and on the basis of some anonymous letters received from investigators in the following months, in which the doctor was linked to the murders. Later, other threatening phone calls addressed to ""Dora"" were intercepted: in one of these a female voice referred, in addition to the alleged murder of Narducci, to the ""murder of Pacciani"". According to the person on the phone, both murders were allegedly committed by members of a ""satanic sect"", because the victims were guilty of having betrayed them.
Statements by people informed about the facts and anomalies in the investigations on the corpse led to the hypothesis that Narducci had been murdered. In 2002 the body was exhumed, on which autopsy tests showed the presence of lesions compatible with strangulation; some hypothesized the involvement of a Masonic lodge, to which Narducci's father belonged. According to Ugo Narducci, on the other hand, his son Francesco voluntarily took his own life after he was diagnosed with a serious health problem. At the time, however, the official version of the family was that of the misfortune. 


- Suspect: Francesco Calamandrei


In 1988 Mariella Ciulli, ex wife of Francesco Calamandrei, a pharmacist from San Casciano, went to the Carabinieri and reported that a few years earlier, when she was still married to the man, she had found a pistol in the house, precisely a Beretta.  She had also found  some macabre fetishes in the refrigerator. The Carabinieri immediately carried out a search of Calamandrei's house, but found nothing unusual. In 1991, the woman went to the Carabinieri again to provide new information. According to Mariella Ciulli, on the night of August 21, 1968, she was in a car together with her husband, in the vicinity of Castelletti di Signa (theater of the double murder Lo Bianco-Locci), when they both heard shots. The two then saw a child and brought him to safety. Ciulli also declared that her husband used to hang out with bad people (including Pacciani, Vanni and Lotti), and that, on the night of the last murders, he returned home with face wounds; she later revealed that he was the owner of various weapons, which he then threw into the sea, shortly after the last crime. The Carabinieri searched the pharmacist's home again, but again they found nothing suspicious. Due to her unsupported revelations, Ciulli was soon taken as unreliable, moved by the desire to take revenge on her husband who had left her for another woman with whom he had later remarried. Later, repeated subsequent complaints against her ex-husband were not even taken into consideration by the police.
On January 16, 2004 the head of the Florence police, Michele Giuttari, in charge of re-examining the case, asked Prosecutor Paolo Canessa for a warrant to search the pharmacist's house again. On January 20, 2004, the search took place. On May 21, 2008, at the end of a trial with an abbreviated procedure which began in September 2007, Calamandrei, accused of being the instigator of the crimes, was acquitted of the charges . He died in 2012 at the age of 71.


- Hypothesis of the solitary serial killer linked to the Sardinian lead


 A thesis followed in recent years and profiled, for example, by the English writer Magdalen Nabb and by the journalist Mario Spezi, is that the Monster was an individual linked to the ""Clan of the Sardinians"", already investigated in the events of the serial killings. The thesis in question starts from the reconstruction of the first murder in 1968, considering it actually committed for sentimental and ""honor"" reasons by subjects linked to the Mele and Vinci families. However, the Monster could be completely unrelated to this affair, having only subsequently appropriated the gun and ammunition to start the serial chain of murders. According to this hypothesis, only a member of the families involved in the first crime of 1968 could have appropriated the pistol and bullets, as it is completely unlikely that the owner would transfer a weapon and a box of ammunition already used in a murder to a stranger.
According to the aforementioned journalist and writer, the murders are attributable to a single person, a serial killer who always acted alone. It should be emphasized that their suspect ""Carlo"", aka the Monster of Florence, was alleged to be a man born in 1959 and that at the time of the first crime he was only 9 years old. Mario Spezi and Douglas Preston specify that they never held ""Carlo"" responsible for the 1968 crime and that he was arrested in September 1983 for detention and receiving stolen arms, about a week after the murder of the two German boys, but was acquitted. He only ended up in prison again in 1988, three years after the last double murder. The real name of ""Carlo"" has been removed from the Italian version of the book, but it was present in the first edition in English. 


- Hypothesis of the serial killer in uniform


 Another important hypothesis is that expressed by the lawyer Nino Filastò. The writer-lawyer, who has been investigating the Monster since the early eighties, in addition to having been Mario Vanni's lawyer, tried to prove the innocence of the ""snack companions"" with a global analysis of the whole affair. In his book the inconsistencies in the testimony of Giancarlo Lotti are highlighted and the methods of investigation are criticized. The lawyer compares the figure of Lotti to that of Stefano Mele: both were intellectually very modest and suggestible, but due to an incorrect (according to Filastò) investigative trail, they became leading characters in two different periods of the investigations. 
In his hypothesis the Monster is a lust murder type serial killer suffering from a serious sexual pathology, active at least from 1968 to 1993 and whose name never entered the investigation. Some elements, such as the registration document found out of place in the car of a murdered couple, or the Monster's ability to easily approach the cars, lead the lawyer to frame the killer as a ""man in uniform"". Someone who might be able to interact with the investigations and even know and anticipate some of the investigators' moves. Radical is also Filastò's criticism of the ""esoteric"" and ""instigators"" hypotesys, considered anti-historical and criminologically incompatible with serial crimes of a manic nature. In fact, Filastò considers absurd and grotesque the hypothesis of a sect or an organization that used the ""snack companions"" as laborers.


- Hypothesis Zodiac 


 In an investigation conducted by the journalist Francesco Amicone, published between 2018 and 2021 it is claimed that the US serial killer Zodiac is the Monster of Florence. According to Amicone, the serial killer was Giuseppe ""Joe"" Bevilacqua, born in Totowa, New Jersey, on December 20, 1935. Bevilacqua, a witness to the Pacciani trial, lived and worked at the American cemetery in Florence in San Casciano from July 1974 to late 1988, a few hundred meters from the site of the last crime attributed to the Monster. Prior to the publication of the investigation, Amicone reported a series of talks he had with him in Florence. Bevilacqua allegedly admitted his guilt in the crimes committed by the Monster and the Zodiac. Bevilacqua, according to the investigation, is the same individual that Mario Vanni identified with the name ""Ulysses, the American"". In addition to allegedly putting his name and surname in a cipher, Bevilacqua allegedly signed his crimes and his letters making allusions to the Italian word ""water"" (acqua), contained in his surname. A similar reference to water is also found in the magazine clippings used to compose the Monster's letter to Silvia Della Monica. Bevilacqua, in 2018, threatened lawsuits, replying that he had never confessed.
In an article published on April 23, 2021, Amicone detailed the telephone conversation that took place with Bevilacqua on September 11, 2017. Allegedly, after the admissions, Bevilacqua was in the process of turning himself in and carrying the gun used in the crimes of the Monster, before changing his mind after hearing a lawyer. The article provides further insight into the suspect's past, such as his 20-year military background in the United States Army, his participation as a CID agent in the Khaki Mafia investigations at in the 1960s, (which is why he was in San Francisco around the time of Zodiac's activity). After the discharge from the army and the transfer to the American cemetery in Florence, the former CID agent allegedly started to perpetrate his crimes in the surroundings of Florence. 
Italian authorities collected Bevilacqua's DNA in late 2020.


- Hypothesis ""Rosso del Mugello""


  Another alternative hypothesis identified in the man seen by Baldo Bardazzi - and by numerous other witnesses in the town of Vicchio - as the one and only murderer of the couples. As already mentioned in the chapter dedicated to the murder of Pia Rontini and Claudio Stefanacci, the man in question was tall (175-180 cm (5,9 ft)), robust and balding with reddish-blond hair. The hypothesis of the so-called ""Rosso del Mugello"" is particularly supported by the documentary maker Paolo Cochi. In 2021 there have been numerous updates on this theory, given that the man in question appears to have been identified (by Cochi himself) in a old report by the Carabinieri (never disclosed to the public and found in the numerous files of the investigation) which identified a man with the same physiognomic elements (tall, robust, balding with reddish-blond hair) as suspected of being the author of a theft of a Beretta caliber 22 series 70 which took place in an armory in Borgo San Lorenzo in 1965, as well as the author of the series of crimes of the Monster. The subject in question was interrogated and searched after the crime in Vicchio and was found in possession of Winchester 22-gauge cartridges with H embossed on the caseback. The personal details of the man have not been disclosed to the public for obvious reasons of privacy , but Paolo Cochi has repeatedly repeated that the man worked within the judicial environment, however, without specifying his profession. At the end of 2020, Rosanna De Nuccio (sister of Carmela De Nuccio, killed by the Monster in 1981) instructed the lawyer Antonio Mazzeo to carry out investigations regarding the murder of his sister, as no guilty party was found for this murder.
The lawyer Antonio Mazzeo appointed the documentary maker Paolo Cochi as a consultant and asked the President of the Court of Assizes of Florence for the documents concerning the murder, as well as documents concerning other murders in the series. The aforementioned President authorizes access to these documents. After the analysis of the various documents, Mazzeo and Cochi decided to ask for access to further documents concerning - in addition to the De Nuccio-Foggi murder - the criminal record and photos of the man identified by the Carabinieri in the file never disclosed to the public. The request for access to the documents this time was sent directly to the Prosecutor Luca Turco who, on February 4, 2021, denied access to these documents and also revoked access to the documents concerning the De Nuccio - Foggi murders. 
This denial, according to the lawyer Mazzeo, was absolutely unjustified for a number of reasons. This refusal has sparked numerous controversies on the part of those interested in the ""Rosso del Mugello"" lead and has also led two politicians to present some queries. The Minister of Justice Marta Cartabia responded by confirming the refusal of the Prosecutor, stating that his conduct is in compliance with the rules of the current Code.


- Recent developments


In 2018 the discovery of a genetic trace not attributable to the victims was announced. It was found on a forgotten artifact of the last crime, a bloody handkerchief, found in a bush together with surgeon's gloves. In 1985 Professor Riccardo Cagliesi (of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Florence) had drawn up a report of 13 pages, indicating that the material was human blood of group B (compatible for example with the blood group of Mario Vanni but not with that of Pacciani) and there was also a fragment of human hair, brown in color. This find was then forgotten, until 2018.
In 2019, an expert report was released according to which the Monster's weapon may not have been the famous Beretta 22 caliber but a modified firearm or another 22 caliber, or the Beretta itself but with the barrel replaced.
In 2021, the Scientific Police carried out an inspection in one of the murder sites with the aim of looking for new clues using modern technologies that did not exist at the time of the crimes. 


- Suspect: Giampiero Vigilanti


Giampiero Vigilanti, a former legionnaire, born in 1930 in Vicchio del Mugello was entered in the register of suspects in 2017; he knew Pacciani and, according to him, in 1948 he had a quarrel and a physical fight with him. He had already been searched in September 1985, three days before the first search at Pacciani's house and a few days after the last crime, following the report of some neighbors who indicated him as the possible responsible for the crimes. In fact his car resembled the one seen when the identikit was made. Some newspaper clippings on the crimes were found in his home; he was acquainted with almost all the people involved in various ways in the investigations, including the ""snack companions"", the Sardinians and Narducci; in the 1950s he had fought in Indochina with the French foreign legion in which he was enlisted in 1952. Marshal Antonio Amore, who searched him for the first time, saw a photo in his house where Vigilanti was posing next to beheaded corpses of enemies, and with a severed head in his hand. Vigilanti claimed to have killed 300-500 enemies during the Indochina War. After leaving the legion in 1960, he worked as an extra in cinema, opened a nightclub in Marseille, did various jobs and then worked in a funeral home in Prato until his retirement.


A 1984 a witness had said that a person observed the victims Claudio Stefanacci and Pia Rontini with insistence before the crime; this man was described as a tall, robust person, elegantly dressed, and with a large ring on his finger, like the legionary ring worn by Vigilanti, who, invited to attend the funeral, did not come. However, the original ring was lost. The legionnaire was not investigated, although in 1986 he was on the same list of 38 suspects drawn up by the police and by Perugini's SAM (Vigilanti at number 38, Pacciani at number 31). Vigilanti stated in 2017 that Pia Rontini was killed ""for refusal"", and was being harassed by a doctor. Nine years later, in 1994, due to a quarrel with a neighbor, he underwent a second search and 176 bullets of the same brand as those used in the crimes were found, but the investigations did not lead to anything and Vigilanti was cleared. For the eight double murders, given Vigilanti's proximity to the far right, a new lead was hypothesized linked to the ""strategy of tension"" in Italy under which crimes were committed to distract the magistrates from the political subversive activity of the time. In 1998, the year of Pacciani's death, Vigilanti made a comeback by participating in a television program where he claimed to have had a large inheritance from ""Joe"", an unidentified American uncle. The hypothesis was then resumed in 2017 after a complaint by lawyer Vieri Adriani, lawyer for the family of victim Nadine Mauriot. However, the head of the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately denied that the ongoing investigations had revealed evidence linking the crimes to possible subversive environments. Vigilanti was however investigated for complicity in murder for all eight crimes. He plead innocent but said he knew some information. 
Following this statements, Francesco Caccamo (an 86-year-old doctor from Mugello enrolled in Freemasonry) was indicated by Vigilanti (who also stated that Pacciani and Vanni were innocent) as responsible. Both were entered in the register of suspects but from the search at the doctor's home there was no confirmation of this thesis. Vigilanti owned a 22 caliber Beretta, which was not found to be the murder weapon in 1994. He reported the theft of the gun in 2013 along with other pistols. In 2019 Vigilanti was reported for domestic abuse by his wife. In September 2019, the Prosecutor asked for the filing of Vigilanti and Caccamo due to the insufficiency elements collected against them in the preliminary investigation phase.

- (6) Horst Wilhelm Meyer and Jens-Uwe Rüsch (Giogoli - Friday, September 9, 1983) 


On 9 September 1983, in Giogoli, two German boys were murdered. They were Jens-Uwe Rüsch and Horst Wilhelm Meyer, both 24, students at the University of Münster who were in their van at the time of the attack, with the radio on. The boys were reached and killed by seven bullets fired through the van, but only 4 shells of the 7 were found. The investigations following the crime established that the shots were fired from a height of about 1,3 to 1,5 meters from the ground, which suggests that the killer was at least 1.80 meters (5,9 ft) tall, or even more. However, the hypothesis of the killer's height being above average is not shared by everyone. The murderer first killed Meyer with three shots in very rapid succession, while Rüsch tried in vain to escape but was then also hit by four bullets. Once the two young men were killed, the murderer got on the back of the van but, realizing that the victims were both male, he disappeared without using sidearms and carrying out any excision on the bodies. In this case, the killer was perhaps misled by Rüsch's long hair and slender build, who was probably mistaken for a woman. The victims' money and cameras were not taken, nor did any valuables appear to be missing.


It was therefore thought that the murderer, who couldnt be Stefano Mele (he was in jail) nor Francesco Vinci, could instead be another person belonging to their circle of acquaintances. Giovanni Mele (Stefano's brother) and Piero Mucciarini (Giovanni Mele's brother-in-law) were therefore indicted and investigated. Piero Mucciarini and Giovanni Mele remained detained for eight months on charges of being the perpetrators of the double murders. The two were then released from prison, and quickly got out of the investigation definitively, as there was no evidence against them that would justify their indictment. Above all, the two were in prison during the period in which the murder of Claudio Stefanacci and Pia Rontini was committed. For a certain period Salvatore Vinci, Francesco's brother was also investigated for the murders. Stefano Mele died in 1995 of a heart attack following surgery, while residing in a hospice for ex-prisoners.


- (7) Claudio Stefanacci and Pia Rontini (Vicchio - Sunday, July 29, 1984)


The victims of the penultimate crime were Claudio Stefanacci (21-year-old university student) and 18-year-old Pia Gilda Rontini (employed at a bar and majorette in the musical band). The car of the young couple was parked at the end of a secluded road against the embankment of a hill. When attacked, the couple were half-naked in the back seat of the car. The murderer shot through the glass of the right door hitting the boy four times (including one in the head), and twice the girl who had tried to escape (one bullet in the back and one in the forehead). Subsequently the murderer raged with several stabs to the bodies, hitting Pia twice in the throat and Claudio a dozen times. The girl's pubis and left breast were removed. The chain she wore was torn off and the cross-shaped pendant was removed. In this case the handbag was neither searched nor tampered with, presumably because it was hidden under the passenger seat.
The boy's mother, worried about the delay, went to look for him at his friends' house who, knowing his habits, went to look for him where they knew he was staying, thus discovering the corpses. Also in this case it seems that the female victim had suffered harassment by unknown people in the days preceding the crime. A friend of Pia's reported receiving a phone call from the young woman, very shortly before the crime, in which Pia told her that in the bar where she worked ""there were unpleasant people with whom she felt very insecure"". This fact seemed to be corroborated by Baldo Bardazzi, his father Piero and his sister, (managers of a diner in San Piero a Sieve) who declared that they recognized the couple. In fact the couple, in the afternoon of July 29 (around 4:45 pm, a few hours before the murder) were at their diner. Immediately after them, according to Bardazzi, a ""distinguished gentleman"" arrived, about 40/45 years old, tall, burly, with an intense and gruff look, in a suit and tie, with blond or reddish hair. He ordered a beer and sat outside, scrutinizing with intensity and anger the couple who was inside the diner. As soon as the young couple had eaten their meal and approached the cashier to pay, the man, who had taken half an hour to consume half a glass, drank the rest of the beer in one go and followed them. Bardazzi, at the request of the Carabinieri, participated to the funeral of the victims with the intention of identifying  the man seen at his diner, but he didn't recognize him.


Identikit made by Baldo Bardazzi (1984): https://images.app.goo.gl/VgWpFK7XAXex8oPbA


A man with a similar physiognomy was seen, about two Saturdays before the crime, by Emanuela Bazzi, Pia's colleague at the bar where she worked. In particular, the man was described as tall, robust, balding with reddish-blond hair, with a full face and with a Tuscan dialect, around 45 years old. In a testimony, Bazzi reported that she had recognized the man in question because, prior to the murder of Pia and Claudio, he had annoyed a girl who went into the bar to get an ice cream. The man, who knew where the teenager was staying, asked her: ""Are you still camped up there?"". Receiving an affirmative answer, he also asked her: ""So I'm coming to see you tonight?"". The girl replied nervously: ""No, I'm not there tonight."" Bazzi stated that the young woman was so upset that she didn't even take her change and left quickly. The day before the murder the same man, after ordering a coffee, bothered Bazzi herself, asking her: ""Manuela, are you going dancing?"". Annoyed, she gave him a negative answer. Pia's colleague asked for news about this stranger, learning that he was from Scarperia. Bazzi was not asked to make any identikit, however she saw the identikit made by Bardazzi, stating that the man she saw resembled the subject depicted. 
Another colleague of Pia's, Luciana Lelmi, also saw a man for the first time on July 22, 1984, describing him as robust, very balding with straight blond hair and a Tuscan accent, around 45 years old. According to Lelmi, the subject in question did not appear completely normal when he spoke and had the characteristic of scrutinizing people eagerly from top to bottom. She was shown Bardazzi's identikit and said that the man depicted resembled the subject she noticed, asserting, however, that she did not know him. The man was last seen by Lelmi on August 1, 1984, three days after the crime, when he entered the bar to have a coffee. However, on this occasion, he did not have any kind of interaction with the people in the bar, not showing harassing attitudes. After consuming his coffee, the man left and was never  seen again.
This person was also seen by two other witnesses: Franco L. and Tiziana S. . Franco reported having seen, on the evening of July 28 or 29, around 8 pm at the same bar, a very distinguished man, with a serious look: tall, robust, balding with short light hair, who came in to have a coffee; the witness saw the identikit and considered the man he had seen to be very similar to the one depicted. Tiziana, on the other hand, claimed to have seen him on July 14. She described him as a man about 40/45 years old, tall, distinguished, robust, with a slightly oval face, balding with light brown or reddish-blond hair. He was behind a bush on the bank of the river Sieve, about ten meters from the entrance to the road where the crime took place, spying on the people who were fishing and sunbathing. Suddenly, those present were alarmed by the fall of a stone and all turned to the man who, noticing that he was being watched, disappeared .


Another witness was a security guard, Nicola Esposito, who saw a man with the same physical characteristics. In the summer of 1981 the security guard was having a coffee at a bar located in Calenzano, when he was approached by a man who was drinking a beer at the counter. The man asked Esposito questions about his weapon and, shortly after, he took out three .22 Long Rifle bullets (with H embossed on the caseback, they were old and oxidized) and asked: ""Do you want them? at home I have another 500 or 600 "". Esposito took them, put them in his pocket and left. The security guard describes the man as tall (about 180 cm, 5,9 ft), robust, with a little belly and with broad shoulders, round face, reddish cheeks, balding with very short hair pulled back of a reddish-blond color, without beard or mustache; the accent was Tuscan, not accentuated. 
Another friend of Pia Rontini said that in the week before the crime, while he was driving the girl home in his car after the evening shift, he had noticed that he had been followed a couple of times by an amaranth or faded red mid-size car. There were also numerous sightings, in the week before the murder, of an amaranth red Renault car parked with only one person on board, near the area where the couple was killed. Bardazzi was heard by prosecutor Canessa, who highlighted some inconsistencies in his testimony, as the timing of the movement of the couple was not precise and in addition Bardazzi himself  at the trial did not prove so certain that he had recognized the couple. However, in multiple testimonies Bardazzi said he was sure that the couple he saw were Pia and Claudio, as they were also recognized by his father and sister in the immediacy of the fact and also because the couple had parked a light-colored Fiat Panda near the venue, just like Claudio's car. The couple, according to Bardazzi, were not new faces and had already come to the diner other times. 


- (8) Jean-Michel Kraveichvili and Nadine Mauriot (Scopeti - Sunday, September 8, 1985)


The last double murder took place in the countryside of San Casciano, in the hamlet of Scopeti, inside a pitch adjacent to a cemetery and surrounded by cypresses, where couples used to seclude themselves. The victims were two young French: Jean-Michel Kraveichvili (a 25-year-old musician) and 36-year-old Nadine Mauriot (owner of a shoe shop, mother of two young girls, recently separated from her husband); both were from Audincourt, a town in eastern France. The victims were camped in a small tent just off the road. The murder was traced by some to the night of September 8, by others to the night before, a consideration that was motivated by the presence on the corpses of fly larvae who need at least 25 hours of time to develop.
The methods of the attack were similar to those previously put into practice by the murderer, except that, in this case, the victims were not in the car but in a tent pitched near their car: the murderer, after having severed with a knife the outer fabric of the tent on the back, moved towards the entrance of the tent and shot. Nadine died immediately; Jean-Michel, not mortally wounded, managed to get out of the tent and fled to the woods, but was reached by the murderer who  stabbed him and then hid his body among some rubbish in a place not far from the tent. After being extracted from the tent in order to carry out mutilations on the pubis and on the left breast, the woman's corpse was also somehow hidden and rearranged inside the tent so that it was not immediately visible.
This particular modus operandi suggests that the murderer had the intention of delaying the discovery of the bodies as much as possible. Added to this is the fact that the murderer explicitly wanted to challenge the investigators: between September 7 and September 9 he sent a letter containing a flap of Nadine Mauriot's left breast. The letter was delivered to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Florence on September 10. The prosecutor Silvia Della Monica, who since the early months of 1984 had delegated the investigations to colleagues to deal with other cases, was the recipient of the macabre correspondence. On the front of the envelope, in addition to a stamp depicting the Castle of Bosa, the following sentence was written, with letters cut from a newspaper: ""DOTT. DELLA MONICA SILVIA PROCURA DELLA REPUBLICA 50I00 FLORENCE"" [Doctor Monica Silvia prosecutor's office]. Note that the word ""Repubblica"" [republic] was written with a missing letter B and the number 1 of the postal code ""50100"" was written with a capital letter I. The murderer used a dextrin-based glue to glue the newspaper letters and the stamp, while to seal the letter he did not use saliva, but a common glue. Inside the envelope there was a sheet folded on itself and carefully glued along the edges; inside this sheet lied a polyethylene bag containing the aforementioned breast flap. For 35 years it was not known which magazine the Monster used to cut out the letters. However, in 2020 the magazine was identified as the magazine ""Gente"" number 51 on newsstands from December 14 to 20, 1984. 


The letter: https://images.app.goo.gl/LmWsggTtBYy85ii1A


In addition to the letter sent to Della Monica, other letters also arrived at the Prosecutor's Office in Florence: on October 1 two anonymous envelopes were delivered, addressed to the deputy prosecutors Paolo Canessa and Francesco Fleury. These letters contained a photocopy of an article from the newspaper ""La Nazione"" dated September 29, 1985, entitled ""The Monster made another error"" and with the subtitle ""on the night of the crime all roads were checked and his car may have been reported by a toll collector "". On the edge of the photocopy there was the following text written with a typewriter: ""one each is enough"". Inside the envelope, in addition to the newspaper article, there was a sheet of paper on which a surgical glove finger containing a Winchester brand cartridge 22 with ""H"" embossed on the caseback had been stapled. On October 5 another letter arrived in the prosecutor's office, addressed to the deputy prosecutor Piero Luigi Vigna. Inside the pouch there were full surgical gloves and a glove finger containing a Winchester brand cartridge .22 caliber with ""H"" imprinted on the caseback  On all three letters the recipient's name and address had been typed. 
The biological tests showed that on the flaps of the envelopes there were traces of saliva that belong to a subject with blood group A. However, there is no certainty that this two last letters were sent by the murderer, since they did not contain any real evidence. The breast shred sent to the prosecutor remains the only unequivocal ""message"" sent by the Monster to the investigators. In modern times, a genetic report by prof. Ugo Ricci (forensic geneticist biologist at the Careggi Polyclinic in Florence) showed the presence of the same unknown saliva DNA profile, consisting of 10 alleles out of 22, on all three letters. This DNA, called ""Exhibit 80"", was compared with the DNA of the suspects, giving a negative result in any case. Recently, the documentary maker Paolo Cochi interviewed Dr. Marina Baldi, forensic geneticist, who stated that the profile obtained from the three letters, being made up of a sufficient number of alleles (10 total), is absolutely usable not only for comparisons with other profiles, but also for more detailed analyzes, such as for example the determination of phenotypic aspects of the author of the letters, such as the color of the eyes and hair.



- The Sardinian lead


 Stefano Mele was found guilty for the double murder in 1968. But then the shells found in the file of the murder were connected to the Monster. Mele was in prison in 1974, he couldnt be the Monster therefore the investigations were directed towards other people that he had accused in the past. This investigation, which developed during the 1980s, represented the main line of investigation in the Monster case until the acquittal of all suspects in 1989.
The investigators questioned Mele again, who accused Francesco Vinci again. But Vinci was in prison in August 1982 for mistreating his wife. While in prison, two months later, he was accused of being the Monster, but then a new murder took place in 1983, so he was therefore cleared of the charge; in 1993 he was found murdered in a pine forest near Chianni; he had been locked up in the trunk of a Volvo set on fire; a connection with the story of the Monster was hypothesized, a hypothesis however almost immediately discarded; more probably, also given the modalities of the crime, his murder was to be considered a revenge born in Sardinian criminal environments around which Vinci gravitated. The case remained essentially unsolved. The mystery of the shells found by pure chance in the file continued to create controversies. The journalist Mario Spezi discovered that there was no trace of the anonymous tip that, in the summer of 1982, had suggested to the investigators the connection between the crimes of the Monster and that of 1968. Without any developments the investigation ended in 1989.


- Suspect: Pietro Pacciani


Pietro Pacciani in 1984: https://images.app.goo.gl/vFmNDTUyFD4gBFy46


After the last murders in 1985 the investigations continued but, until 1991, there were no significant developments. The SAM (Anti-Monster Squad: the group of law enforcement agencies that had been investigating exclusively the murders of the Monster since 1984) was headed by Ruggero Perugini. Pietro Pacciani became the prime suspect in 1991, while he was in prison for the rape of his two daughters; an anonymous letter dating back to 1985 invited investigators to investigate him. Born in Ampinana in 1925, he was a former partisan nicknamed ""the Vampa"" because of his short temper and his past as a fire eater for village fairs. Pacciani was described as a choleric, depraved and brutal man, regardless of the accusations concerning the crimes of the Monster of Florence. In 1951, at the age of 26, Pacciani surprised his then girlfriend (just fifteen), in intimate attitudes with another man; taken by jealousy he stabbed his rival to death, then forced the girl to have sexual intercourse next to the corpse. He was arrested and trialed: he declared that he had been blinded by fury, having seen his fiancée exposing her left breast (the same one that in the last two crimes was removed from the female victims). For this murder Pacciani was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which he served entirely. The story was infamous in Tuscany, so much so that it was told by storytellers. The analogy of this crime with those of the Monster were the intuition and the main clue that lead the investigators to seriously investigate Pacciani. The hypotesys was that he killed couples to relive, as a ""winner"", the crime in 1951, particularly raging on the woman who symbolized the ex-girlfriend who had betrayed him. The clues were various: Pacciani wrote the word Republic with a single B, he owned newspapers and magazines that spoke of the crimes of the Monster, photos with pubis marked in pencil and had written on a sheet of paper a license plate number of a car belonging to a couple who was staying in the Scopeti area, the scene of the crime in 1985. Furthermore, Pacciani had links (some explicit, others more forced) with all the places where the eight double murders took place. However, what could theoretically have evidential value were only three objects held by Pacciani: a cartridge found in his garden [more about this later], a drawing pad and a soap dish (both thought to belong to the victims of the murders in 1983) He was a sexually perverse and violent person, even after the murder in 1951, not only towards his family. One time he kicked and shoveled a man who ended up hospitalized for 26 days. Pacciani, in addition to denying his guilt, wanted to be seen as an ""innocent lamb"", a poor farmer (as he liked to define himself), that is, the image of a good and simple person, despite the testimony of people who knew him as a very violent, arrogant and quarrelsome man. Many of his fellow villagers were very afraid of him and were careful not to frequent him.
Public opinion was essentially split in two over his guilt. What is certain is that Pacciani was a rather particular character: a chronic liar, poet and self-taught painter as a hobby, experimented with a thousand professions. Over the years, his violent disposition were directed at his wife, a semi-mentally ill woman (beaten and forced into sexual relations), and their two daughters, kept segregated at home, fed with dog food, beaten, raped; the two daughters left home as soon as they came of age, definitively breaking off with their father, and shortly after leaving the house they reported him for rape (accusation for which Pacciani was convicted, remaining in prison from 1987 to 1991). 


[To have a better understanding of the trial I will explain briefly how the justice system works in Italy. There are three degrees of judgement: the first trial, the appeal and the appeal to the supreme court (Cassazione). So you have ""three chances"" to disprove your guilt.]


Pacciani was arrested on charges of being the Monster on January 17, 1993. On April 19, 1994, the trial of first degree began, with the prosecution represented by the deputy prosecutor Paolo Canessa and which ended on November 1, 1994 with the sentence of to life imprisonment for being responsible for fourteen of the sixteen murders he was charged for (he was found not guilty of the first double murder in 1968). However, he was then acquitted fifteen months later, in the appeal trial. In fact, on February 13, 1996, Pacciani was acquitted by the Court of Appeal of Florence for not having committed the crime and was therefore released from prison. The magistrate, president of the court of appeal, harshly criticized the accusatory system against Pacciani (later putting, in black and white, all the criticisms of the investigation in a book). However, on December 12, 1996, the Supreme Court annulled the acquittal and ordered a new appeal process, which would never be held due to Pacciani's death on February 22, 1998. The previous appeal process against Pacciani was judged compromised by a technical error, which prevented the hearing and verbalization of the testimonies of four people (nicknamed Alfa, Beta, Gamma and Delta), among whom there where the ""snack companions"".
Various elements were evaluated for the conviction of Pacciani in the first trial, mostly of circumstantial value, like interceptions of violent reproaches to his wife Angiolina (which in themselves proved nothing, but which weakened the image of a meek and harmless man that Pacciani wanted to give of himself), a pistol cartridge (on appeal later judged as ""worthless"" in a ""polluted investigation"") compatible with the shells found in the murder sites and found in Pacciani's garden, some objects that the prosecution believed belonged to some of the victims, in addition to the testimonies of some people who recognized him in the places of the murders as a voyeur. In 2019, a new survey was carried out on the bullet found in Pacciani's garden in 1992. The new report revealed that the marks on that bullet had been artifacts, thus suggesting that the bullet had been tampered with on purpose, as claimed by Pacciani himself during the trial. The other two objects (the drawing pad and soap dish) were also not connected to the victims in any meaninful way. An element initially overlooked in the trial was the large movements of money in the farmer's bank account, figures perhaps too large at the time for a simple farmer like him. This money was considered as an indication of his involvement only in investigations following the convictions of the ""snack companions"", when it was hypothesized that Pacciani and his buddies had received money to carry out the killings on commission from never identified instigators. The thesis that Pacciani was a mercenary assassin on commission was incompatible with that of the trial in 1994, where Pacciani was accused of being a solitary serial killer. Only in the mid-nineties the investigations focused in more detail on some of Pacciani's friends involved in the affair: Mario Vanni, Giancarlo Lotti and Fernando Pucci.


Following the acquittal of Pacciani in the appeal process, his wife decided to leave their home and in July of the same year she started the procedures for the separation. In December 1996 Pacciani was indicted for kidnapping and mistreatment of his wife. Pacciani, after the acquittal, had returned to live alone in his cottage, where in the evening he used to barricade himself, bolting the door and all the shutters, as if he was afraid of something or someone (as confirmed from the testimonies of neighbors). In May 1996 Gessica Massaro, an aspiring pornstar from Taranto, claimed to have become Pacciani's lover and to have filmed their erotic exploits in a video. Pacciani denied it, but on September 16, 1998 the video - entitled Porn Motel - was officially presented by Massaro and made visible to subscribers of a site created ad hoc by the producers (for non-subscribers, the only visible scene showed the walk of the two in the garden of his house in Mercatale). The video is currently lost media.
On February 22, 1998, before the second appeal trial, Pacciani was found dead in his home with his pants down and his sweater pulled up to the neck. The clothes had significant fecal soiling. The autopsy showed that Pacciani had died of natural causes. In anatomopathological terms it was a condition of severe atheromatous coronary heart disease with postischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (outcome of multiple previous infarct events). At the level of the gastric cavity, the presence of Formoterol fumarate (an antiasthmatic drug better known under the name Eolus) was detected. The toxicological tests performed did not give a positive indication on the presence of the aforementioned drug in the blood stream, thus excluding a possible causal / concausal effect of death by the drug. It should be remembered that the drug in question was prescribed by Pacciani's general practitioner, on April 19, 1997. The prescription was made for probable bronchial problems. 


 In the investigations about the esoteric and the instigators lead it was hypothesized by the investigators that Pacciani was part of an esoteric-satanic sect and that he had been killed, through the anti-asthmatic drug, by the members of the aforementioned sect because he had betrayed them. This hypothesis, in addition to not having medical-legal evidence, is illogical as the drug was prescribed by Pacciani's general practitioner. 
The fact that Pacciani died of natural causes was also recently reiterated by the coroner Giovanni Marello (the one who performed the autopsy on Pacciani). In particular, prof. Marello underlined the fact that Pacciani was a severely cardiopathic elderly person and the anatomopathological findings highlighted in the autopsy are not compatible with poisoning. Pacciani's remains were exhumed in July 2013 to be destined for a mass grave. One of the main witnesses of the accusation against Pacciani was Giuseppe Bevilacqua (former director of the American cemetery in Florence) who said he saw the farmer in the area near the last crime attributed to the murderer, in 1985, a few hours after the murders [more about him later].


 - The ""snack companions"" (Mario Vanni, Giancarlo Lotti, Fernando Pucci)


-Mario Vanni


Mario Vanni, born in San Casciano in 1927, was a retired postman nicknamed ""Torsolo"" (an awkward and clumsy person). He became particularly infamous as the involuntary inventor of the term "" snacks companions''. While he was heard as a witness at the trial against Pacciani, Vanni was asked ""Mr. Vanni, what work do you do?""; he answered, starting his deposition in an unexpected and illogical way ""I have been eating snacks with Pacciani, no?"". Vanni was probably misled by the expression ""what work do you do?"", which in the Tuscan dialect is equivalent to ""but what have you done?"". Vanni was arrested concurrently with the acquittal of Pietro Pacciani, for complicity in double murder and vilification of a corpse, carried out together with Pacciani according to the prosecution. During the course of the trial Vanni demonstrated a hostile attitude towards the judges, mostly dictated by ignorance, alcohol abuse, fear and his advanced age, which perhaps did not allow him to clearly understand the course of the hearings . He was often removed from the courtroom, until he was expelled after having threatened Prosecutor Canessa with the expression ""then there will be the Lord who will punish Mr. Canessa with a hideous pain, he will have to suffer like a dog"", then he boasted his political faith for Mussolini and fascism, shouting «Long live the Duce, work and freedom! We will be back! Sooner or later! "". However, his defense attorney Nino Filastò later managed to get him readmitted to court. Vanni was sentenced to life in prison. The sentence, for only four of the eight double murders, was finalized in 2000 by the Supreme Court. In 2004 his sentence was suspended for health reasons, as he was suffering from senile dementia. Vanni spent his last five years in a retirement home for the non self-sufficient elderly in the province of Florence. He was admitted to the hospital in April 2009 and died the next day at the age of 81. 


-Giancarlo Lotti


Giancarlo Lotti, nicknamed ""Katanga"", was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the crimes of the Monster; like Mario Vanni he was also born in San Casciano, in 1940. He was orphaned of both parents at a young age and isolated from relatives, he was an unemployed person who previously had only small odd jobs. He was also an acoholic since adolescence and had intellectual problems. He lived with the help of the local charity and, unable to pay rent independently, he found accommodation in the rectory of a parish priest. Lotti confessed to the investigators, forced by the testimony of his friend Fernando Pucci, who indicated that he had seen the crimes in 1985 take placs and that he had been led there by Lotti himself. Pucci testified ""The visibility was not bad because the moon was growing [...] As he approached us we saw two people between the car I mentioned and the tent. One was shorter and stockier and the other was taller. The stocky one had a gun in his hand. The taller one was holding a kitchen knife. The stocky one saw us and immediately said to us: I'll kill you, I'll kill you, go away! We turned our backs and ran away. When we got back to the car I was quite frightened. One of the two seemed to be Vanni, indeed it was certainly Vanni. The stocky one with the gun, I recognized him as Pacciani"".
Lotti then admitted to having been present at the crime, accusing Pacciani and Vanni. Subsequently, he also accused himself of that crime, as of the two previous ones in 1982 and 1983. In particular, in the murder of the two German boys in 1983, he allegedly shot them, threatened by Pacciani himself. Lotti's testimonies were considered decisive in all stages of the trial, although the accused had maintained an ambiguous and reticent attitude.


The thesis according to which Lotti was a suggestible, mentally challenged, mythomaniac subject and that therefore his statements were unreliable was considered unfounded. The judge wrote in the appeal sentence: ""It is worth remembering immediately that the said individual (Lotti Giancarlo) was subjected to an appraisal by psychiatric consultants of the Public Prosecutor [...] he was declared a ""lucid, alert, conscious, perfectly oriented in time, space, towards his person and the situation in question"". Furthermore, the same judge reported, in relation to the feared possibility that Lotti could have accused himself in order to obtain benefits: ""I suspect that the thought of solving the problems of his life by serving 30 years of imprisonment but happy with this for the advantages that law reserves to collaborators of justice, well this thing appear to this judge to be meaningless because it is completely unproven first of all and then contrary to common sense ""
It must be said that the defense of Mario Vanni (Nino Filastò) highlighted some inconsistencies in the reconstruction of the crimes made by Lotti, which were not accepted by the judge. Lotti did not obtain, as requested by his lawyer, any benefit as a collaborator of justice. His sentence was 26 years in prison. He was released from prison on March 15, 2002 for serious health reasons and on March 30 he died at the age of 61 from a liver tumor, from which he had been afflicted for a long time, due to his alcoholism. 


-Fernando Pucci


Born in Montefiridolfi in 1932, he was a friend of the three ""snack companions"". He had a disability recognized in 1983 as oligophrenia and was a decisive witness in the sentences of his ""snack companions"". Regarding his condition, a new appraisal was drawn to ascertain whether Pucci really was suffering from some disability and the result was: ""The intellectual assets appeared poor but not exactly as deficient as shown by the commission for civil invalids back in 1983 ... vigilant attention and valid memory without hints of yielding or slowing down or numbness ... The thought is not very rich in content, rather monotonous and not very modulated. The logical connections are however preserved and the contents were always pertinent to the context in question"".
According to the assessments, collected by the judge, there was no reason why this subject was unable to give testimony. He deposed against Pacciani and Vanni as an eyewitness to the last two murders: ""To look at what had happened without being noticed we turned a bit between the branches, to get to the side of the car parked near the tent. Shortly after we saw this scene: one of the two, the taller one, Vanni, went behind the back of the tent and with that kitchen knife he had in his hand cut the fabric. I also remember the noise he made , of torn canvas. The gesture I saw seemed to me to be done from the bottom up. At this point the man came out of the tent, from the front, running away towards the wood, that is, on the opposite side of the road... having a gun, that is, Pacciani, shot him and followed him while he ran away, continuing to shoot "". Pucci's statements left some doubts, the witness at first appeared reticent. Furthermore, in the courtroom the defense tried to invalidate his statements. Fernando Pucci died in 2017, at the age of 84.

A coroner's court has heard that Ms Geertsema's partner, John Shepherd, is considered a ""person of interest"" in her disappearance, but no charges have been laid. 

Mr Shepherd, who now lives in Westbury, sat in the back of the courtroom alongside his wife of 30 years as the inquest began.

In her opening statement, counsel assisting the coroner Madeleine Wilson SC told the court that on the night Ms Geertsema disappeared, one of her daughters had reported there was a heated argument between Mr Shepherd and her mother.

That argument was then ""followed by hitting sounds, followed by silence,"" Ms Wilson said.

Ms Wilson put to the court that Ms Geertsema was planning a life without Mr Shepherd, without ""fear and violence"".

""She didn't choose to go; her life was ended for her,"" Ms Wilson said.

* The former partner of a Tasmanian woman who went missing more than 40 years ago is being considered a person of interest in her disappearance, a coroner's court has heard. Almost 43 years on, a coronial inquest will in December examine how she disappeared and consider whether ""she was murdered"".

""[There's] no evidence to find Ms Geertsema had left the state, had committed suicide or drowned in Devonport,"" counsel assisting the Coroner Madeleine Wilson SC told a case management conference in the coroner's court in Launceston on Thursday.

""Her body was never found."" 

Ms Wilson told the court that Ms Geertsema's former partner, John Shepherd, was considered a ""person of interest"" in her disappearance, but no charges had been laid.

Mr Shepherd, who now lives in Westbury and has been married for 30 years to another woman, sat at the back of the court with his wife during the hearing.

Ms Wilson said Ms Geertsema and Mr Shepherd met in 1971 and started dating.

""It was not an exclusive relationship,"" Ms Wilson told the court.

The court heard Ms Geertsema was also having a relationship with a man called Micky Rowe, who lived in Westbury, and whom she intended to marry.

""She was leaving John Shepherd and going to live with Micky Rowe,"" Ms Wilson told the court.

The court heard on the night she disappeared, Ms Geertsema told Mr Shepherd she was going to visit a friend in Parkham, in the state's north-west, but she never arrived.

Ms Wilson told the court it was Mr Shepherd who reported Ms Geertsema missing to police.

The court heard Mr Shepherd told police that Ms Geertsema was in ""a very distressed state"" before she went missing and that she'd told him that she was pregnant and had cancer.

However, Ms Wilson said the missing woman had visited a GP the morning of her disappearance, and that the doctor had reported she was ""in good spirits, was not pregnant and did not have cancer"".

Inquest to examine relationships

The inquest into Ms Geertsema's disappearance has been set for December 13, 14 and 15 and will be heard in Launceston.

The court heard he will give evidence during the coronial inquest and he is in the process of getting legal representation.

The inquest is expected to hear from 13 witnesses. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-14/darlene-geertsema-missing-person-inquest-person-of-interest/100538560","Inquest into 1978 disappearance of Devonport mother Darlene Geertsema begins: The ""psychic"" daughter of a missing Tasmanian woman who was last seen more than 40 years ago believes her mother is buried ""in a gold mine"", a coroner's court has heard."

Then, in 1988, the partially decomposed remains of a white female were located in a rural area of Owen County, KY, laying in close proximity to a roadway.  Due to decomposition, they couldn't identify the victim. She has been estimated to be between the ages of 25-40.

Although it sounds far-fetched that a girl who went missing in Australia would end up in the USA, there are several ways in which this could have happened such as human trafficking or even a simple kidnapping. 

The resemblance between the two is uncannily similar. Observe the thin lips and the thin eyebrows. The Nasolabial folds are also similar and their eyes are downward sloping. According to her year of birth, in 1988, she would have been 33 which fits the age estimate.

324,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,[],1639331640,"  Twenty-seven-year-old Su Taraskiewicz was a Northwest Airlines ramp supervisor and only the second female ground service employee working for the airline. She was the first woman promoted to her supervisor position. On September 12, 1992, Su left work to go get food for her coworkers and vanished. On September 14, her body was found stuffed in her trunk, parked at a nearby auto body shop. She had been stabbed multiple times and beaten to death. At first, her family assumed that she was the victim of a random act of violence until in late 1993, her mother Marlene found her diary and was shocked at what was written in it. It told of sexual harassment, threatening graffiti in men's room and cargo holds, and other incidents that had occurred to her while working for Northwest Airlines. Marlene was certain that it had something to do with her murder.  
In one incident in April of 1989, a coworker named Bobby damaged her radio twice. Su asked her boyfriend to talk to Bobby about getting her a new radio. When she spoke to Bobby again, he threatened to kill her boyfriend. She filed several complaints to the airline and her union, but little was done about it. After she filed the reports, the harassment worsened; she received several anonymous phone calls, with the caller threatening to hurt her. Also, on several occasions, her and her boyfriend's cars were vandalized. Friends and co-workers who supported her also had their cars vandalized.  
Su's diary only covered the first eight months of her time at Northwest. However, several co-workers reported that the discrimination and harassment continued. In February of 1992, she was promoted to ramp supervisor. Originally, another co-worker had received the job. However, Su learned that he had illegally bid for the job. She filed a grievance and won; as a result, she received the position. Shortly after her promotion, Su found a graffiti drawing of a coffin with her name on it in her locker. Despite this, she continued to work harder.  
She and her co-worker, Deborah Mazeikus, were involved in a meeting with Northwest that did not go well. During the meeting, Su became upset and started to cry. Deborah was concerned about the emotional toll that the harassment was causing in Su's life. She told Deborah that she was scared, but did not elaborate on who she was scared of. Deborah believes that she was afraid for her life. The harassment continued, and then came September 12, when she mysteriously disappeared after leaving work to pick up food for her crew. Surprisingly, her co-workers did not report her missing for a day and a half.  
When she was later found dead, police suspected that her death may have been connected to a federal investigation of Northwest Airlines that took place in the summer preceding her murder. Some of the baggage handlers working with her were operating a stolen credit card ring. When shipments of new cards were transported by Northwest jets, they would steal them and use them or sell them. Ten of them were later arrested and convicted, some of which were named by her in her diary.  
Su's family later settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with Northwest Airlines. A $250,000 reward is being offered by her family for an arrest in the case, which remains open but unsolved.  
**Suspects:** Before Susan left work on the night she vanished, around 1AM she received a telephone call from an unidentified person who wanted to meet her. Marlene believes that the call was from someone Su trusted, who lured her to a meeting with her killer.  
Two prime suspects in the case are two of Su's coworkers: Joseph Nuzzo and Robert Brooks (also known as Bobby). Su had several problems with the two; Brooks had broken her radio for no apparent reason and later threatened her. Nuzzo also threatened her after she broke up a fight between him and another employee. As a result, he was suspended from work for six months. He blamed Su for this; during this time, he keyed her car, slashed her tires, staked out her house, made anonymous telephone calls, and told others that he would ""exact revenge"".  
Shortly after Nuzzo returned to work, he and several other baggage handlers began to steal credit cards from mail bags air-freighted by Northwest. Brooks was also involved in the scam, using the cards with Nuzzo. In August of 1992, several baggage handlers were subpoenaed by a grand jury. Nuzzo allegedly believed that Su had told the police about the scheme. Two days later, he was fired. A few weeks after his firing, Su was found dead.  
Nuzzo was later convicted on various charges related to the credit card scheme. Brooks moved out of the area prior to the murder; he cooperated with police and later pleaded guilty to theft and fraud charges. However, he was later charged with lying to a federal grand jury. He claimed that he was working in another state on the night of Su's murder and that he didn't talk to Nuzzo on the day of Su's murder. Both statements were proven false.  
Nuzzo and Brooks remain suspects, along with Su's other co-workers at Northwest.  
**Extra Notes:** This case first aired on the February 9, 1996 episode. A fictionalized version of the case was featured on the show ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"".  
**Results:** Unsolved. Staff at Northwest Airlines refused an interview on the show, leaving a lot of questions of what led directly to Su's death. The case is still open and being investigated by law enforcement. Nuzzo and Brooks, along with several of Su's other coworkers, remain prime suspects in her murder. Each year, Su's family and friends hold a memorial service on the anniversary of her death.  
Sadly, Su's father and brother have both since passed away.

325,imagrandma2,[],1639302758,"It’s an indication that progress is ramping up in the case of Ayla a decade after her disappearance, which is giving her mother, Trista Reynolds, renewed hope.

“I’m actually hoping that this is the year my Christmas wish will come true,” Reynolds said this week.

Ten years ago this month, the 20-month-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed Ayla was in the care of her father, Justin DiPietro, at his mother’s house on Violette Avenue in Waterville. He called police to report her missing on the morning of Dec. 17, 2011, launching the largest and costliest police investigation in Maine history.

Ayla has never been found and no one has been charged in the case. A judge in 2017 declared her dead, paving the way for Trista Reynolds to file a wrongful death lawsuit against DiPietro in December 2018 that contends he should be held accountable for Ayla’s death.

After delays in the case last year because of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues, Trista Reynolds’ lawyer, William H. Childs, this year received documents he was seeking from the state Attorney General’s Office, including evidence and documents from the Maine State Police investigation. https://www.centralmaine.com/2021/12/12/a-decade-in-the-case-of-missing-waterville-child-ayla-reynolds-ramps-up/

Background:
The biggest criminal investigation in state history began with a 911 call in which a father said his 20-month-old daughter was last seen about 10 hours before, gave a brief description of the green pajamas she was wearing and said “there’s no way” she could have crawled out of her crib.

In transcripts obtained Monday first by the Associated Press and then by the Morning Sentinel through the Freedom of Access Act, Justin DiPietro told the emergency dispatcher that he put his daughter Ayla Reynolds to bed at 8 p.m. Dec. 16, 2011, and that his sister checked on her two hours later, at about 10 p.m.

He dialed 911 the next day at 8:49 a.m. During the call, DiPietro is asked when he last saw Ayla.

“When I put her to bed last night. My sister checked on her. Um, woke up this morning, went to her room and she’s not there,” he says. At one point, the phone call ends and DiPietro calls back, explaining “my cellphone died.”
Asked by a dispatcher about the exact time someone last saw Ayla in her crib, DiPietro asks his sister, Elisha.

Um, Elisha, when was the last, when is last time you went in her room last night when you saw her?” DiPietro asks. She responds 10 p.m. and he repeats the time to the dispatcher.

The Associated Press and Morning Sentinel requested the material after the state Supreme Court ruled such transcripts should be made public unless law enforcement officials can show how releasing the documents would harm an investigation. The Portland Press Herald last year sought transcripts of 911 calls in connection with a fatal shooting in Biddeford, prompting the court’s ruling on such transcripts.

Ayla was reported missing from the Waterville home on Violette Avenue where DiPietro lived with his mother. The night she disappeared, his sister and girlfriend, Courtney Roberts, were at the house with their children. His nmother was not home that night.

The 911 call prompted a search by police that grew to include game wardens, FBI agents and other officers, who canvassed neighborhoods, lowered streams and sent divers into the nearby Kennebec River. Investigators found blood inside the home, and they have concluded that Ayla is no longer alive and was a victim of foul play.
Detectives also said DiPietro, Elisha DiPietro and Roberts know more than they’ve told investigators, but the case remains unsolved and no charges have been filed. https://www.centralmaine.com/2014/02/03/transcripts_detail_justin_dipietro_s_911_call_reporting_ayla_reynolds_missing_/?rel=related&amp;rel=related","Ten years to the day that Justin DiPietro reported his daughter, Ayla Bell Reynolds, missing from their Waterville home, he will be interviewed as part of a civil lawsuit seeking to hold him accountable for her death."
326,MistressGravity,[],1639301545,"Disclaimer: If you're easily distressed, please *do not* listen to the 911 call below. It's seriously heartbreaking and bone-chilling in equal measures.

**What happened that day?**

Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home.

Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. 

When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hands. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There’s a bomb, and my dad just blew up!” By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne’s life. He had died almost instantly.

-----

**Who was Wayne Greavette?**

42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette.

At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. 

-----

**The Evidence**

This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter.

**The Package**

The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled [Domaine D’or Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh), which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we'll get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local to the area.

Two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

In the CBC podcast *Someone Knows Something*, the postwoman’s mother (who, alongside her grandson, were riding along as the postwoman did her rounds) said that the package delivered to the Greavette mailbox that day had a very fancy ribbon on it and that it was not at all heavy, as her grandson was able to lift it.

**The Flashlight**

The flashlight used to house the bomb was a Duracell-brand Floating Lantern around 23 cm long and 15 cm tall, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/h7xo02h). According to Justin, the flashlight might have been glued shut, as he was unable to open the flashlight when trying to get it to work. 

A type of mining explosive emulsion called **Superfrac** was used in the bomb. According to investigator Paul Johnson, around 1-1.5 pounds (0,5-0,7 kg) of Superfrac was probably used. He also said that Superfrac could be easily bought from the manufacturer without a license, but it was also likely obtained through theft. The bomb was also packed with roofing nails to maximise its destructive effect and was powered by a single-cell AA battery. 

**The Letter and Typewriter**

The letter included in the package was a business proposal and was written by one “William J. French”. In the letter, the writer mentioned that he and his partner were planning to start a new business called “Acton Home Products” in the new year (1997) and that he would like a quote from Greavette on fixing some equipment. The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works. Their names had been redacted when the letter was first released to the public.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a [vertical slash](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code ([L7G 2N1](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

However, one thing was chillingly clear: the [postscript](https://imgur.com/a/kH9dxty) of the letter indicated that the writer knew exactly what was going to happen when Wayne switched on the flashlight:

* “Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.**”

-----

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a [sketch](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed himself in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

-----

**Conclusion and personal thoughts**

Today (Sunday, 12 December 2021), is exactly 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are so many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

I'm going to post the link to the video first, for those who're impatient and curious and uninterested in my wall of text. In the interest in not making it a bigger wall of text, I'll also be linking an article outlining the Kenny Veach disappearance in more detail.

**The tl;dr of it is this:** Kenny Veach, an avid hiker, vanished in 2014 after hiking into Area 51 to look for a mysterious M-shaped cave he claimed to have found on an earlier hike that filled him with dread. Frank is a youtuber who's been regularly uploading caving videos (more often abandoned mines) weekly for close to 15 years. I've watched this man's videos for years and think this kind of upload is unlike him. I trust his judgement when it comes to caves.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv4PsEfXL1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv4PsEfXL1E)

[https://nevadamagazine.com/issue/september-october-2019/11423/](https://nevadamagazine.com/issue/september-october-2019/11423/)

I understand that initial reactions might be that the uploader was after the attention a missing persons mystery would bring him, but I don't think that's the case. I've followed Frank's channel for years simply because I enjoy calm caving videos and listening to the facts he has about the abandoned mines he explores, he's extremely knowledgeable and he's been uploading very regularly for as long as I can remember. He does what he does because he loves what he does and he loves sharing it with others, he never talks about view counts or subscribers. He never pulls tacky stunts.

Seeing this there in his uploads when I popped in to check out what he'd been up to lately after taking a break shocked me *because* of how unlike Frank it is for him to claim anything about a real tragedy. He's uploaded videos where he's been a little spooked (but not overreacting over it) and joked about seeing ""ghosts,"" but outright talking about a story as big as Kenny Veach's and calling it a potential candidate for the M cave is... well, I've been a viewer of his long enough to take it at least mostly seriously. He doesn't play any of it up for shock value, he doesn't pander to the camera, he just goes into this cave and comments on what he's seeing as an expert as per his usual style. The music used is normal for his videos.

I've seen almost no real talk of this specific video on Reddit, I did search around and found a few threads that simply slapped the link down with zero explanation, but **I wanted to post as a regular and long time viewer of Frank's**. He **knows** what he's talking about when it comes to mines and caves, he understands how to spot walls that have been tampered with (as miners often blocked up useless or dangerous passages) and what is or isn't out of place in a cave system. If he says something looks suspicious, I believe him. If he sees scratches on a wall that have him second guessing on if they're natural, I believe him. He's never given me reason not to before and I'm shocked this didn't end up in some other ""spooky"" youtuber's content or, if it has, that I haven't heard anything of it until now.

But that's just my two cents, a point of view I hadn't seen shared about this that I felt was worth sharing for those as interested in mysteries as I am. I don't really have anywhere else to go with this, so I'll just leave it up to ya'll to discuss (or not). I've never really been sure what to think of Kenny's disappearance, but it's fun to speculate about government killings and coverups.","""Exploring Abandoned Mines and Unusual Places"" Youtuber Claims to Have Found Kenny Veach's ""M Cave"""

Aside from the extensive damage to the vehicle, there was some red paint found on the car, but no red paint in the area. (I’ll attach a pic in the comments.) The car had 11 miles on it after the air bags had been deployed. According to the Buckeye PD, this is not strange and has been reported before in accidents. 

Although Daniel’s remains have not been found, other human remains have been found in the area. Two have been confirmed to be the remains of other people.

One more sketchy detail, the car was found by a local rancher on July 19th. All prior foot and aerial searches had missed this even though these areas had checked. The Buckeye PD says it could have been missed because it was in a ravine. This all may be understandable except the father said the rancher who found the car was walking through the same area two days prior and told him the vehicle was not there. Considering the aerial searches didn’t find it either, I’d say it’s entirely possibly the car was placed there at a later date.",This case needs your help!

Many people were hesitant to take the word of a murder, especially with such little evidence available. However this story raises a few other points in relation to the media and true crime forums.

- And do you feel pressure to immediately side with the victim ? Within this sub and other subs many of the people who called into question John Eisenman’s story were ridiculed and harassed.

She was reportedly a good student; classmates and teachers alike either loved her or had a tough time getting along with her, as Suzi would speak her mind and didn’t always follow the rules, which got her in trouble at times.  

Melanie took photographs for the high school yearbook, kept score for the basketball team, and worked at Eldora Ski Resort as a valet driver. She also did macrame, painted, made jewelry, wrote poetry, played guitar and sang. She embroidered a large eagle on the back of her denim jacket (the one she was wearing when last seen).  After school she often hitchhiked home with neighbors who lived along Magnolia Road, as she apparently didn’t like riding the bus. Friends saw Melanie with her thumb out near the school the day of her disappearance. 

She never made it home. 

While gas receipts place notorious serial killer Ted Bundy in nearby Golden, CO on the day Melanie disappeared, local authorities say that evidence is inconclusive and continue to treat her homicide as a cold case. 

Given her age, appearance, similarities between the circumstances of Melanie's disappearance and death and those of Bundy victims Debbie Kent (abducted outside her high school), Lynette Culver (ditto), and Melissa Smith (another small-town high school girl, of similar appearance, whose body was discarded in nearby desert), I'm inclined to think Bundy is responsible. The murder took place firmly within his ""Colorado period,"" and gas receipts allegedly put him less than an hour away on the day in question. Bundy lived in Salt Lake City, Utah at the time, so his presence in the area that day is significant. 

Melanie's mother reportedly doesn't think Bundy did it, but she also states that Bundy was ""confessing to anything and everything, with abandon"" in the days before his execution. For one, he never confessed to Melanie's murder, so it's questionable whether the crimes he DID confess to are even relevant; for two, to my knowledge Bundy only confessed to the murders of eight or nine women. Considering the number of crimes he's suspected of, I'd call the number he officially copped to pretty conservative. 

Sadly there's not much info about Melanie online, but here is [her page](https://apps.colorado.gov/apps/coldcase/casedetail.html?id=1337) on the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's website.

She is mentioned briefly in [this article](https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2019/02/11/top-5-takeaways-our-ted-bundy-ama-reddit/2842141002/) on Bundy's Southwest murder spree from the Coloradoan.

SPOKANE, Wash. – Spokane Police have found no evidence a murdered man traded a woman for sex, despite what the woman’s father’s claimed upon his arrest.

John Eisenman is charged with killing Andrew Sorensen in October of 2020. Charging documents say Eisenman told police it started when he rescued his daughter from Seattle, where he claimed Sorensen was trafficking her.

Then a week later he found out where Sorensen was going to be, the documents said. He told detectives he tied Sorensen up, punched him and threw a cinder bock at his head. He then told detectives he stabbed Sorensen several times and locked him in the trunk.

It wasn’t until a year after that Soresen’s body was found. It was discovered in October of this year when someone saw a suspicious car and found his body inside.

Spokane Police announced Eisenman’s arrest in a press release. In that release, police said, “In October 2020 Eisenman learned his juvenile daughter was allegedly sold to a sex trafficking organization in the Seattle area.”

That story made national headlines and people even set up online fundraising accounts to pay for Eisenman’s legal fees.

According to new court documents filed this week, though, investigators said there’s no evidence of sex trafficking. It also said Eisenman was told by his daughter that she was traded for drugs in Seattle.

In the affidavit of facts filed on November 29, investigators said Sorensen and Eisenman’s daughter traveled to Renton together in October 2020. The document said they smoked meth several times on the way over.

According to police, Sorensen dropped Eisenman’s daughter and two others off at a 7-11 and never returned. Investigators later determined his car was stolen.

Eisenman’s daughter eventually called Renton Police to say she was stranded. Renton Police said when they arrived, the woman was uncooperative and walked away.

“I can find no information that indicates that Sorensen and \[Eisenman’s daughter\] ever met up again,” wrote Spokane Police Office Randy Lesser.

Police found evidence the two interacted on Facebook two days later.

“When \[she\] sends Facebook messages to Sorensen… she never mentions anything about Sorensen allegedly sex trafficking her,” Lesser wrote.

The woman showed up at the emergency department of Sacred Heart on October 23, 2020. According to court documents, she told a mental health specialist that she met a guy in Seattle who gave her drugs and sex trafficked her; she never mentioned Sorensen. She later told someone else at the hospital that her boyfriend took her to Seattle and sold her for drugs. She also said she had been homeless for three weeks and had been passed around for sex.",John Eisenman case update: the 'Hero Dad' who was praised all over the media (including on this sub) for killing his daughter's sex trafficker is no hero.
333,aeiourandom,[],1639195819,"On the night of 18th August, 1980, Thomas Cooper, an 18 year old apprentice plumber, and his 16-year-old girlfriend drove to the beachside carpark at Rickett’s Point in Beaumaris, Melbourne, located near the Beaumaris Yacht Club. The car park was a well-known spot for couples to go ""parking"", and Mr Cooper went there several times a week with his girlfriend. The seclusion of the area also provided the opportunity for someone to hide and stalk anyone who happened to visit the carpark that night.

The couple arrived at 7.15 pm, Tom parking his white Holden sedan and the couple remaining inside their car.  They had been there for just 5 minutes when, without warning, a man smashed the driver’s window with a rifle barrel.

As Mr Cooper attempted to drive away, with the gunman yelled “don’t!”

Mr Cooper frantically drove the car back to the main road to escape the gunman, but the gunman fired several shots with a .22 rifle and Mr Cooper was hit three times.

Between Mr Cooper and his girlfriend, they managed to steer the car out on to Beach Rd where it crashed into a fence. His girlfriend was able to immediately flag passers-by and raise the alarm but Mr Cooper had died.

Mr Cooper’s girlfriend told police she saw the murderer for a only few seconds in the darkness, but that he appeared to be alone. She described him as Caucasian, about 25 years old or younger, 182cm tall, of medium build with shoulder-length black hair.  He was unshaven and had a moustache, and wore a dark coloured cowboy hat and possibly a coat. His identikit image is quite distinctive, someone knew this man.

Mr Cooper’s girlfriend was not injured in the attack. Unfortunately she passed away in May 2020, without this case being resolved.

A $1 million reward is on offer to solve the case.

Senior Sgt Ron Iddles, a detective on the 2013 review of the case, stated in the media that police have identified a strong suspect. The suspect had been interviewed soon after the murders but had an alibi from a female friend. “Believing that the tyranny of time might have changed things, we revisited the female who provided him with his alibi,’’ Sen-Sgt Iddles said. “Unfortunately we discovered she is still friendly with the suspect, but we will keep pursuing him.’’

In 2017, 3AW, a local radio station did a segment on the murder and received two calls, one possibly linking the son of an underworld figure to the murder, the other claimed they may have also seen the alleged murder around the same time.

In 2020, Detective Inspector Dean Thomas, from Victoria Police's Homicide Squad, said the motivation for the murder remained unclear. ""There are a number of possibilities, including that the shooting was sexually motivated and the girl in the car may have been the target,"" Det. Insp. Thomas said. ""We know that many couples regularly went to this location so the offender may have been stalking the area in the lead up to the shooting.

""The one thing we do know is that someone out there will know who is responsible for shooting Thomas and we're hopeful that after four decades, this person is ready to come forward and assist us with bringing his family some justice,"" he said.

At the time of Mr Cooper's murder, police released a digital composite image of a man they wished to speak to in relation to the incident.  This image has been forensically updated and aged to show what this man might look like in 2020. See links.

""Thomas's family have had to go 40 years without the answer to who would want to kill their son and brother,"" Det. Insp. Thomas said. ""As we always say, a lot can change over the years and hopefully this reward and the passage of time will encourage someone to come forward and give his family some peace.""

I would really like to see this solved. Just an innocent young man out parking at a Melbourne beach with his girlfriend and a lover’s lane stalker comes up and shoots him. As mentioned, Police believe they know who did this but he is being provided with an alibi by a female friend. Hopefully loyalties change over time and rewards or conscience lead to a break in the case.

The Family murders are the name of the murders of five young men and teenagers who happened in Adelaide, South Australia between 1979 and 1983. There’s a conviction in the last murder in the series, but I will include it due to the similarity and due to the man convicted being suspected in the other murders as well. There’s quite a lot of characters in this story but I will mainly focus on the three main suspects. The crimes are believed to be committed by a loosely knit group consisting of 12-13 individuals. 

# The suspects 

I’ll start with the last murder. 

**Bevan von Einem** was convicted in 1984 of the 1983 murder of 15-year-old Richard Dallas Kelvin. Kelvin was the son of a popular local news presenter and had gone missing, not long from his home on June 5, 1983. His body was found in scrub in Kersbrook on July 24, 1983, but is believed to have died around July 10 or July 11. His cause of death was blood loss due to an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a large blunt object. He had been held captive and tortured for around 5 weeks, and there was evidence that his hair had been cut in captivity. Five drugs were found in his system, Mandrax, Noctec, Rohypnol, Valium, and Amatel. Both the cause of death and Mandrax and Noctec are a recurring theme in these crimes. 

Bevan von Einem, also known as BVE, was born on May 29, 1946. He would drive around and pick up hitchhikers, offer them a spiked drink before raping them. Often he would undo his car exhaust or pull his choke out, before asking young men to help him. He would build relationships with drug addicts and give them drugs in exchange for helping him lure young men into his care. He would also use transgender women or crossdressers to lure young men under the pretense of going to a party. I only mention that they are transgenders due to it being a trait of his. He would also use his female friends as lures. 

**Mr R**, also known as “The Businessman”, was born in 1946, and was 33-years-old in 1979. He has lived with his partner known only as MGL in one of Adelaide’s “money suburbs” since the late 1970’s and is still living at the same house. 

**Mr B**, also known as “The Doctor”, was named as one of the main suspects by South Australian police in 2008. It’s known he was born in the UK in May 1956 and moved to Australia in 1966. He grew up with his six siblings on the outskirts of Adelaide. It’s mentioned that he was a former “child prostitute” but this isn’t elaborated on. He met BVE in 1979 when Mr B was 23, but could possibly have met him before. He’s currently living where he grew up and is working in the hospitality industry. Mr B made contact with the police two days after the first victim was found in 1979. Mr B was the star witness in BVE’s committal hearing. In BVE’s trial he stated:

* That he was present when BVE had picked up young men hitchhiking and drugged them. 
* That he had witnessed BVE with a naked youth who had a torch and an instrument similar to a large stainless steel crochet hook in his anus. 
* Mr B had been in the car when BVE picked up the first victim, and BVE had then called Mr R at a cafe. Mr B stated he left after they had met up with Mr R, but not before BVE invited him to “do some surgery on this guy”, leaving the unconscious first victim in the back of the car. Mr B’s sister testified that he had admitted that he was present when the first victim was killed. 

# The murders 

16-year-old **Alan Arthur Barnes** was reported missing on June 18, 1979, after failing to return from visiting a friend. He was last seen while hitchhiking being picked up by a white HQ Holden sedan carrying three or four people. There were several unconfirmed sightings, but one deemed credible was a sighting of Barnes in the company of two males the night before his body was located. His body was found in the South Para Reservoir on June 24, 1979. 

It was determined he had been held captive for 5 days, tortured and beaten, and his body had been washed and re-dressed. Toxicology showed he had alcohol and the drug Noctec in his blood. His cause of death was blood loss from an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a large blunt object. 

**Neil Frederick Muir** was 25 years old in 1979. He was suspected to be a prostitute, at the very least having sex with a doctor named Peter Millhouse in return for drugs. He frequented gay haunts but was not thought to be gay. Muir had known BVE since he was 18 years old. It’s stated in one source that he was involved in procuring boys for BVE. 

Muir was last seen on August 27, 1979, and his body was found the next day. His body had been cut into 4 sections and his organs had been removed and have never been found. His scrotum was cut open, the testicles off and the penis shaft neatly cut down the midline. I saw someone somewhere mention that this mutilation to his penis resembled genital reassignment surgery. Tattoos had been removed and his remains had been tightly wrapped in garbage bags, and placed inside his abdominal cavity. His head was tied to the torso with a rope going through the mouth and out through the neck. His cause of death was massive blood loss from an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a large blunt object. According to one source, a toxicology couldn’t be performed due to his organs missing, but another said the drug Noctec was found in his blood. 

14-year-old Peter Stogneff’s skull was found in Two Wells, on June 22, 1982, after a farmer had burned scrub off his property. The farmer returned home and called the police the next day, and the rest of the remains were discovered. Stogneff had been reported missing on August 27, 1981, after he failed to return home after having left. He had been supposed to meet his similarly aged uncle at Rundle Mall, but it was canceled the night before. It’s unclear if Stogneff went into the city anyway. There are reports of him having been seen with an adult male at Tea Tree Plaza the day he went missing, but this man has never been identified, though he is reported to have resembled one of BVE’s friends Noel Brook. Due to his remains having been burned, a cause of death couldn’t be determined, but his remains had been cut into three pieces. 

18-year-old Mark Andrew Langley went missing in the early morning hours of February 28, 1982, after leaving a party with two of his friends. A minor argument ensued which resulted in Langley getting out of the car and walking away. The friends drove off but returned shortly after to collect him, but he was nowhere to be seen. His body was found in scrub in Piccadilly, on March 8, 1982, but it was determined he likely died within 24 to 48 hours of his abduction. He died of blood loss due to anal injuries like the other victims. His body had been cut with a surgical instrument from his navel to his pubic region, which had been shaved. A part of his small bowel had been removed, and it’s believed evidence of the object that had been inserted into his anus had been left behind, and the perpetrator(s) had retrieved it. His body had been washed and re-dressed, and a sedative-hypnotic drug called Mandrax which was popular in the 1970’s disco scene, was found in his blood.

On April 10, 1815, [Mount Tambora in Indonesia exploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora), the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history with somewhere around 4 to 10 times the energy of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. It could be heard more than 1200 miles away, obliterated a bronze age culture living on the island, and lead to the deaths of 71,000-117,000 people. On the [Volcanic Explosive Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index), Tambora was classified VEI-7, super-colossal (the Yellowstone supervolcano is expected to be VEI-8, mega-colossal), and somewhere on the order of 100 cubic kilometers of material was ejected into the atmosphere, where it would hang for months, causing anomalies in the global climate leading to the year 1816 being called ""[the Year Without a Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer)"" in Europe, all the way on the opposite side of the planet.

Climate scientists researching the impact of volcanic eruptions on climate have found a clear record of the Tambora eruption in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, including a large spike in the concentration of atmospheric sulfates, as can be expected from the amount of sulfur that was output by the volcano. However, they also found another spike in sulfate concentration that would correspond to another slightly smaller VEI-6 volcanic eruption a few years prior to Tambora, sometime around 1809. This was further refined by tree ring data to late 1808 specifically.

It was the smoking gun evidence that there had been an eruption almost as large as Tambora just 7 years earlier... the only problem was, there was no smoking volcano to go with it. A VEI-6 volcanic eruption is not small. Krakatoa in 1883 and Pinatubo in 1991 were both VEI-6, and Mt. St. Helens in 1980 and Vesuvius that buried Pompeii in 79ce were both VEI-5. If Tambora could be heard up to 1200 miles away, surely *someone* would have noticed this mystery eruption. And if Tambora created a caldera 6-7 kilometers in diameter, surely there should be something similar left behind wherever the mystery eruption took place.

In addition to ice cores and tree ring data, we do have some slightly more direct records to corroborate an eruption. Colombian scientist Francisco José de Caldas was Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Bogotá, and in 1809 he recorded unusually cold weather and a ""transparent cloud that obstructs the sun's brilliance"". This transparent cloud was likely a ""dry fog"" similar one observed in 1816 in relation to the Tambora eruption, possibly comprised of aerosolized sulfuric acid. And in Peru, physician Hipólito Unanue made similar meteorological observations.

Thanks to these observations, the window for the eruption has been narrowed to within 7 days of December 4, 1808. We also know that the source was almost definitely a tropical volcano in the southern hemisphere, but no further south than 20 degrees south latitude. This leaves a swath of the southwestern Pacific ocean from roughly Indonesia to Tonga, an area where European sailors had visited but not yet colonized. There are indigenous accounts of eruptions, one or more of which could possibly our mystery eruption, but none of them are datable with any certainty. There are two confirmed eruptions in 1808, in the Azores and in the Philippines, but both occurred to early in the year to be the culprit.

336,Susan-B-Cat-Anthony,[],1639164449,"[Stacy Pennant](https://charleyproject.org/case/stacy-a-pennant) was a [21-year old Jamaican immigrant living in Laurelton, Queens, NYC](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1329dfny.html). She worked the graveyard shift at JFK airport as a cargo handler and attended classes at Queensboro College during the day. She kept a regular schedule, lived with her family, and had no reason to disappear. On the night of February 9, 1995 she drove with a friend to see the movie ""Higher Learning"" at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream. After the movie, she drove the friend home to Canarsie, Brooklyn, and dropped them off on E. 85th Street between Ave. M and Ave. N at 11:30pm. She was given directions back to the Belt Parkway, a highway which should have taken her home to Laurelton in about 30-40 minutes without any traffic. That was the last time anyone saw Stacy or her 1990 Honda Civic Del Sol. 


We've all seen in the news recent stories of long-missing people and their cars being found submerged in bodies of water. I propose that the reason why Stacy and her car have not been found in 26 years is because her vehicle entered the water that night and has been not easily accessible or visible.


[This is the route Stacy should have taken to get home that night using the Belt Parkway. It is basically a straight line eastward back home to Queens](https://imgur.com/vxKkKPg)


[The Belt Parkway has overpasses spanning 3 creeks which empty out into Jamaica Bay, but there are high barriers along the highway. It's possible her car could have entered the water here, but I think it would have been noticed by the many cars and boats traveling above and through these areas.](https://imgur.com/jfC3JWH)


[The section in red is where the Belt Parkway meets the Van Wyck Expressway. There is often horrible traffic here from airport departures and arrivals. One way to detour around the traffic is to take the JFK Expressway, a highway that circles the airport. Stacy worked at JFK Airport as a cargo handler. I think because of her job, she likely knew about shortcuts to drive into and around the airport, especially the area around the employee parking lot.](https://imgur.com/xxixO4l)


[The JFK employee parking lot is located just off Lefferts Blvd. If there is bad traffic on the eastbound Belt Parkway, and you work at the airport like Stacy did, you might know to exit the highway at Lefferts Blvd, and turn onto Pan Am Road to get you around to the other side of the airport. Pan Am Road is where the employee parking lot is located and it runs very close to an inlet called Bergen Basin. This restricted waterway curves around the area where the airport fuel tanks are located. Signs warn no boating or swimming allowed. The tracks just north of Pan Am Road were renovated in 1998 when the Air Train was built, but I don't know whether Bergen Basin was affected by that.](https://imgur.com/w8lQEDQ)


[As of November 2021, there is a surprisingly low guardrail between Pan Am Road and the marshland surrounding Bergen Basin. There is landscaping between the water and the pavement, but you are only a few feet from the water's edge for most of the course of Pan Am Road.](https://imgur.com/DHfgtXs)



[The weather at JFK on the night of February 9, 1995 was in the 20s and windy.](https://imgur.com/aLF6Ivy)


I think it is possible that Stacy was tired from school and work, it was dark, cold, and windy, with perhaps ice on the pavement. If you are from NYC, you know there is always awful traffic on the Belt going by JFK. If you work at JFK, you might know how to avoid that traffic, especially by detouring down a roadway leading from the employee parking lot. I propose Stacy took a shortcut down Pan Am Road to avoid that section of the eastbound Belt Parkway on her way home to Laurelton. I think it's possible Stacy's vehicle entered the water of Bergen Basin, and because it's a restricted area no one has yet found the car in 26 years. 


I know there have been many theories over the years about what happened to Stacy: [from possible connections to another woman found murdered from the same area](https://medium.com/they-matter/cold-case-stacy-a-pennant-49e65bbad2b0), to a [very tenuous connection to an AC4 victim](https://murderincorp.wordpress.com/2020/05/21/stacey-pennant/). But I always come back to the fact that her car has never been found after all these years. Unlike Stacy, Kimberly Antonakos' car was found soon after her disappearance. Time and again when I hear about a person missing with their vehicle, they often end up being discovered under water. That's why I think it's possible.

337,Environmental_War_62,[],1639162135,"Hello, this is another ecuadorean case that I would like to share. It also takes place in Quito, the country's capital. This unidentified body is tied to the case of a girl name Juliana Campoverde so I'll give you a summary of that case:

**Juliana Campoverde** 

Juliana was a eighteen year old girl who went missing on July 7, 2012. On that day she and her mother were walking together and came across Jonathan Carrillo, the pastor of an evangelist church they had attended until a month ago. Juliana was supposed to go to work and then hang out with her boyfriend, but she never met him like she had planned to. On the following weeks, there was this strange pattern where a member of Jonathan's family would contact Juliana's mother Elizabeth and tell her God had send them visions and that she would soon hear from her daughter, shortly after Elizabeth would get a message from Juliana's number. In 2018 Jonathan Carrillo was arrested in connection to the disappearance, it was discovered he had created a secret Facebook account to stalk Juliana and all the text messages the family received after July 7 were sent from his phone. Jonathan eventually confessed to have killed Juliana and said he had thrown her body in the Bellavista ravine, located in northern Quito.  

**The bones found** 

The same year a search was carried out on that ravine and, as you can guess from the title, human remains were indeed found. Sadly they weren't much, a news article says the search team was only able to find a human jaw and some ribs but nothing more. Four DNA tests were made with Juliana's parents samples, two came back unconclusive and the other two were negative, which begs the question: if that is not Juliana, then who is it? There is very little information about this set of remains unfortunately, just that they are very few and not Juliana's and that's it. It is not even clear if it is a Jane Doe or a John Doe or how did those bones end up there. I couldn't find out if Jonathan was questioned further about the remains, apparently he chose to remain silent after confessing but was convicted of kidnapping which resulted in death and got 25 years. In April of this year more searches were carried out in the ravine but came up empty, no more bones were found and to this day police hasn't been able to locate Juliana's body or identify the skeletal remains found in the initial search.

338,angelcxntt,[],1639151653,"Summer Moon Wells was last seen outside her family home in Rogersville Tennessee. 
Summers mom reports she was outside helping her Grandmother with the garden on June 25th, then at some point around 6.30pm, Summer did decide ventured back inside the home on her own because she ""wanted to go downstairs and play with her toys"". 
The day after she went missing, there was an Amber Alert issued that sadly did not bring any leads. The police also searched the area, but that sadly did not bring any leads either. 
Summers parents both believe that she was abducted from the home. Despite officials saying there is no evidence to support his claims. Summers three brothers have since been removed from the home and placed in the custody of Tennessee CPS. Recently Summers father made a statement after The Church Hill Rescue Squad set out a reward for any information leading up to finding Summer. He stated he did not believe it was right,because the Church Hill Rescue Squad reward is only up for six months, expiring in December. He stated it feels like they are giving up on his daughter in just a few months. Her parents also were interviewed speaking about their daughter in which they seemed to have forgotten the daughters birthdate and other information regarding their daughter. 
In Early September, Police were on the lookout for a maroon Toyota Tacoma between the years 1998-2000, that may have been seen around the area Summer went missing from but there have been no updates on that since then except that Summers teacher did purchase a similar red / maroon truck weeks prior after her father passed away.
Summers mother had a sister who also went missing in 2009, she was reported to be six at the time. This is not believed to be connected at this time, however there is speculation surrounding it. 

Facts to keep in mind when researching this case 
1. Shortly before Summer's disappearance, her previously chin-length blonde hair was buzzed down to a close crop.
2. Summer's three young brothers were removed from the Wells family home six weeks after her disappearance.
It came after Donald claimed that his house was a ""dangerous"" place to be amid a slew of threats being made against him and Candus, which turned reportedly drove him to start drinking heavily.
3. Donald Wells and Candus Bly both previously claimed to have taken and passed a lie detector test in relation to Summer's disappearance.
4. Around three weeks later after the disappearance, in July, Donald offered the grim prediction that Summer is probably no longer alive.
""Statistically speaking, there's a good chance she's already dead,"" Donald told the Kingsport Times-News. ""I hate to think that. I love her with all my heart.""

State investigators have received over a thousand tips in connection with Summer's vanishing but the Hawkins County Sheriff's Office said they have so far yielded no concrete leads.

The TBI is asking anyone with information about Wells’ whereabouts to call 1-800-TBI-FIND or contact the Hawkins County Sheriff’s Office at 423-272-7121.

The family is also asking for direct tips via their website findsummerwells.com.

**Who was Tracey Mertens?**

[Tracey Ann Mertens](https://imgur.com/a/wbvmzpV) met her future partner Joey Kavanagh when she was 16. At first, it seemed like everything was all right. She fell in love with him, and they had two children, daughter Kelly and son Daniel. By all accounts, Tracey was a good mother who doted on her children.

However, cracks started appearing in their relationship, and the couple often fought with each other. Moreover, Joey also had a heroin addiction at the time, and it was thought that he had owed a lot of people a lot of money.

In mid-December 1994, Tracey, Joey, and the children had moved to a new house in [Rochdale](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rochdale,+UK/@52.8350908,-2.6674954,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x487bb88ceb3db3ab:0x9a885edb20da6527!8m2!3d53.6097136!4d-2.1561), a town just outside of Manchester, around 160 km (100 miles) north of their old house in Birmingham. The reason behind this move is not clear.

-----

**22-23 December 1994**

Thursday, 22 December 1994, was a cold day in Rochdale. Tracey was heading south, back to her old house at [Cattells Grove](https://www.google.com/maps/place/10+Cattells+Grove,+Nechells,+Birmingham+B7+5RA,+UK/@52.4974734,-1.8701899,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4870bb42c6a63329:0xa8d61feac7bdc969!8m2!3d52.4974702!4d-1.8680012) in the Nechelles neighbourhood of Birmingham, to pick up a benefits book. She planned to make the trip as short as possible and to return that night but ended up staying the night at the nearby home of her sister-in-law. The next day, Friday, 23 December, she returned to the [Cattells Grove](https://imgur.com/a/XMKO4UX) house at around 11:50 am.

She’d been in the house for no more than 10 minutes when there was a knock at the front door. When Tracey answered the door, she was confronted by two men who grabbed, blindfolded and forced her into the back seat of a yellow Ford Escort Mk2, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/m3h4VHk). She was driven for about an hour to the [Christ Church](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Christ+Church,+Eaton/@53.1855022,-2.1987168,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487a4570c1c2bf79:0xbd34fb4b6de69c05!8m2!3d53.1855134!4d-2.1965275) in Eaton, Cheshire, around 100 km (60 miles) from Birmingham. When they arrived there, she was brought to the [churchyard](https://imgur.com/a/nbl4DIN), doused with petrol, and set on fire. The two men then left her to die. However, she managed to crawl around 30 metres (100 ft) towards the church gate and the main road, where she was found by a passerby who called 999.

Tracey’s wounds were horrific. She had suffered third-degree burns in more than 95% of her body. She was so severely burned that doctors had difficulty finding a blood vessel to start a drip. Her shoes, which was found near her, had been so thoroughly burned, attending officers thought they were pieces of coal. Despite being critically injured, Tracey was still alive, and over the next 12 hours, she fought with all the might she had to tell detectives everything she knew about what had happened.

Sadly, Tracey succumbed to her injuries and died in the early hours of Christmas Eve 1994. She was just 31 years old.

-----

**The investigation and the suspects**

Tracy described the two men who had abducted her as black (possibly Caribbean) men around 20-30 years old, tall and overweight, and spoke in a Brummie (Birmingham) accent. They were wearing brown leather caps and thigh-length leather coats. She said that as they barged into the house, they were asking her where Joey was and that her abductors had argued at some point in a foreign language, which detectives thought could be Patois, a Jamaican dialect. The yellow Ford Escort that she was taken in had a stuffed animal attached to the rear-right window.

When detectives searched the Cattells Grove address after Tracey’s death, they found the word “death” daubed on one of the windows in paint. They also received a tip from a couple with drug debt who were told that if they didn’t pay up, they’d “get what Tracey Mertens got”.

Detectives spoke to more than 2,000 people in the wake of Tracey’s murder but did not come across any information about the possible identities of the two men. When interviewed by police, Joey claimed that he did not know why Tracey was killed but said that it had nothing to do with his drug addiction. The police also have a DNA profile that could eliminate suspects. 

In November 1997, a coroner inquest into Tracey’s death returned an *open verdict*, meaning that there was insufficient evidence to make a definitive ruling on her cause of death. Her family was deeply unhappy about this verdict, wanting her death to be ruled an *unlawful killing*. However, according to coroner John Hibbert, an unlawful killing verdict requires evidence that satisfies the standard of proof, and although he believed Tracey’s version of events, it had to be corroborated by other evidence.

The case is still open and the Cheshire police are offering a £30,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Tracey’s killers.

-----

**Conclusion**

It’s been nearly 27 years since Tracey Mertens was violently killed in that Eaton churchyard. Amongst the many unanswered questions of this case, one thing is crystal clear: she was a courageous woman who did not deserve to die in such a dreadful manner. I sincerely hope her surviving relatives and her children can find some peace.

342,CherryBlossom724,[],1639102284,"As the title suggests, this is not a murder mystery in the traditional sense, in that we do know the identity of the killer. However, there are still some big unanswered questions surrounding this case.

**Background**

Charlie Lawson was born on May 10th, 1886, to parents Augustus and Nancy, in the unincorporated community of Lawsonville, North Carolina.

Fannie Manring was born on October 13th, 1892, in Stokes County, North Carolina. Her parents were John Washington Manring and Ona Lee Manring.

Charlie and Fannie were married in 1911 and went on to have eight children together, one of whom (William), died in 1920 of an undisclosed illness. Their other seven children were Marie, Arthur, Carrie, Maybell, James, Raymond, and Mary Lou. Charlie was a tobacco farmer and eventually saved up enough money to purchase a derelict farmhouse in Germantown (North Carolina), near his brothers' farms, in 1927. The Lawson family was well-liked and respected in the community. 

A few months before the murders, Charlie sustained a head injury while digging a ditch. Shortly afterwards he saw a doctor named C. J. Helsabeck, who assured him that the injury was mild and nothing to be concerned about. However, Charlie often complained of severe headaches and insomnia following his accident. The people around him also noticed a marked difference in his personality. The previously kind and easygoing Charlie was now said to exhibit rude and impatient behavior on a regular basis. 

Two weeks before Christmas in 1929, Charlie took Fannie and their kids shopping in Winston-Salem. He allowed them to pick out whatever clothes, jewelry, shoes, etc. that they wanted. Afterwards, he took them to have a professional family portrait taken, which was costly then. All of this is very odd, because 1. Charlie had never taken the whole family shopping before and 2. He was spending a lot money, despite the fact that they were low income tobacco farmers struggling to make ends meet. I think that his uncharacteristic lavish spending indicates that he was probably already planning to kill them at this point and that he wanted to leave something of them (the picture) that was nice behind for posterity. 

**The murders**

The day of December 25, 1929, started off normally enough for the Lawson family. The oldest daughter, Marie, woke up early that morning to make a two layer Christmas cake as a surprise for her family. Arthur (16) went out rabbit hunting, which was a typical Christmas activity at this time. He ended up running out of ammo though and Charlie sent him into town to buy more. 

While Arthur was in town buying bullets, his father had taken a 12-gauge shotgun and shot and/or bludgeoned Fannie and six of their children (ranging in age from 4 months to 17 years old). He then went out to the woods. Relatives came to the house shortly after the murders, wanting to wish the Lawsons a Merry Christmas, but instead came upon a grisly scene of seven dead bodies. A couple hours later, a gunshot was heard out in the woods, which led to the discovery of Charlie Lawson's body. He had committed suicide. Footprints all around the area in which his body lay and which formed a circle, suggested that he had been pacing, perhaps for hours, after the murders. Was he trying to process what he had just done? Or maybe he was just working up the nerve to end his life? Or perhaps both.

They found two cryptic notes in his pocket, one of which read ""Trouble can cause"" and the other which said ""No one to blame but"".

**The aftermath**

Charlie's brother, Marion, opened up the home as a tourist attraction and it would remain open as such for five years, attracting thousands of visitors, including the mobster John Dillinger. The crime scene was left bloodstained and Marie's uneaten Christmas cake was kept on display as well. They ended up having to protect the cake with a glass cover though, as visitors kept taking raisins off of it as souvenirs. 

The crime shocked everyone and thousands attended the funeral. The bodies were buried in a mass grave, with baby Mary Lou nestled in her mother's arms. 

**Theories**

* 1. Charlie was mentally disturbed and was driven to commit such a horrific act as a result of the head injury that he had sustained months earlier. An autopsy was performed on his brain, but it was determined that his brain had no notable abnormalities. However, autopsies were not as thorough then and medical knowledge was not as advanced, so it's entirely possible that something important was missed in the examination.

* 2. He raped his daughter Marie and had gotten her pregnant. According to Marie's best friend, Ella May Johnson, Marie had confessed to her during a sleepover that she was pregnant with her father's child. Also, Charlie's niece Stella later came forward and claimed to have overheard a conversation once between Fannie and several other women in the family, including Stella's mother Jettie, in which Fannie expressed concern over the incestuous relationship between Charlie and Marie. There was no autopsy done on Marie and as far as I can tell, there was no official record confirming her pregnancy.

* 3. It was a combination of the first two theories.

* 4. The stock market crash of 1929 had occurred two months earlier. Maybe he gave up, decided to blow what little cash they had and then carried out the murder/suicide plan.

**The soul survivor**

Why did Charlie choose to spare his oldest son Arthur's life? Some have speculated that he did so because he believed that Arthur would have stopped him from carrying out his plan. Although presumably he could have circumvented this issue by killing Arthur first. In my opinion, he chose to spare Arthur because he wanted one of his sons to live to carry on his name. This was a still big deal to men during this era. Sadly, Arthur did not live a long life anyway. He died in a car accident in 1945, at the age of 32, leaving behind a wife and 4 children.

343,TTauriSquared,[],1639083893,"The Joshua Guimond case has so many layers — and it's about to get a few more as the legal battle launched by Joshua's father moves forward. Joshua's dad, Brian, sued Minnesota's Stearns County Sheriff's Office for the release of the investigative file pertaining to his son's 19-year disappearance. In January, that case will get a scheduling conference, which will set the date of the initial hearing. 

Brian and his lawyer contend that the investigation into his son's disappearance hasn't been conducted with competency. They refer to the case of Jacob Wetterling as evidence that the Sheriff's Office has a history of incompetence — Jacob Wetterling went missing for 27 years. It wasn't until Danny Heinrich in 2016 admitted to abducting and killing Jacob Wetterling (as part of a plea deal after being arrested for child pornography) that the case was solved. One-time interim Stearns County Sheriff Don Gudmundson referred to the handling of the Wetterling case as an investigation that went ""off the rails."" 

Brian also argues that, from the start, the Sheriff's Office didn't conduct a full investigation, and instead only focused on theory. 

OK, so here's the Joshua Guimond story: 

Joshua was last seen at a card game on campus at St. John's University on Nov. 9, 2002. He left the gathering to go to the bathroom, but never returned. His friends, who claim he wasn't intoxicated despite having beers, assumed he went back to his apartment building, which was located a three-minute walk away on campus. Alarm bells didn't go off until the next morning when he didn't show up to Mock Trial practice. Josh was co-captain of the Mock Trial team and a dedicated poli sci student with plans to go to law school. Leaving without a trace wasn't like him, his friends say. 

His car remained parked and untouched on campus. His keys, wallet, identification, credit cards, glasses and contact lenses remained in his apartment. It also gets pretty cold in Minnesota in November, and Joshua left the gathering in a hooded sweatshirt. 

Three lakes are located on the campus, including Stumpf Lake, which runs between the two apartments (the one Josh was at for the gathering, and the one in which he lived). When the search for Joshua began on the following Monday, investigators and volunteers searched the wooded area around campus, and the Sheriff's Office focused on finding Joshua's body in the water. 

From that point on, Brian claims they only assumed he drunkenly fell into the water and didn't consider the possibility of foul play, which he believes occurred. Despite the nation's top water crime-based investigative body (The Trident Foundation) clearing the lakes and determining that the investigation should look elsewhere, the focus continued to remain on Joshua's body being in the lake. 

Here's where it gets interesting: St. John's University is a Catholic university that includes The Abbey, which houses Catholic monks. In October 2002, The Abbey quietly settled cases involving several allegations of abuse against abbey monks. Since then, 18 monks with credibly allegations of credible abuse have been named and their files have been released. The Stearns County Sheriff's Office says the abbey and the monks have all been cleared and are not suspected to be involved in the disappearance of Joshua. 

It will be interesting to see how the lawsuit goes.

344,PrimeVector19,[],1639077102,"I’m actually a day late with this, so I apologize. 

The disappearance of Trevor Deely is frequently mentioned on this sub, but for those of you who are unfamiliar with his case, here’s a summary below. 

During the early morning hours of December 8th, 2000, Trevor Deely was having a Christmas celebration with some of his co-workers in Dublin, Ireland. Deely and his colleagues had drinks at three different places: Copper Face Jacks, the Hilton Hotel, and Buck Whaley’s. 

At about 3:25 am, Deely left Buck Whaley’s and began walking towards his apartment. There was a heavy storm that night with wind gusts reaching speeds of 60-70 mph; in addition, there was also a taxi strike. 

About ten minutes after he departed Buck Whaley’s, Deely arrived at his office, and he was let in by security. 

CCTV footage showed a still-unidentified man dressed in black waiting for a half hour prior to Deely’s arrival. This man and Deely had a brief conversation. 

Two more men arrived at the gate after Deely entered the building, although those two have since been cleared as colleagues of Deely. 

While inside his office, Deely made himself a cup of tea, spoke to a colleague by the name of Karl Pender, checked his email, and made a note of things to do for his shift the following morning. 

At 4:03 am, Deely left his office, taking an umbrella with him. He continued in the direction of Ballsbridge. He left a voicemail for a friend of his, named Glen. The voicemail was described by his friend was saying “Hi, Glen, I’ve missed you there. Just on my way home, all going good, I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” 

Glen deleted the voicemail, not thinking much of it. 

At 4:14 am, CCTV footage shows Deely walking past the then-AIB Bank on the corner of Baggot Street Bridge and Haddington Road, towards where his flat was. This remains the last confirmed sighting of Trevor Deely. 

About thirty seconds after Deely is last seen, a man in black is seen walking down the same street on CCTV, seemingly following Deely. Authorities believe this is e same man in black who talked to Trevor earlier. No one has ever come forward. 

Some people believe Trevor Deely was a victim of a crime on demand while being at the wrong place at the wrong time; the street he was on was known for gang activity and prostitution. 

Others believe Deely was being stalked as a wanted man. An even smaller number of people believe Deely’s disappearance is linked to the girl he visited in Alaska a few weeks prior. 

What do you think happened to Trevor Deely?

But it is one of those cases that actually never left my human hard drive. Even after consuming everything that was made public (in fact, to learn everything about the case read the Wikipedia article, watch the Fifth Estate Episode and then dive into the fantastic and chilling Series of Podcasts created by the Nighttime Podcast from Canada), Emma or, better, the story of Emma stayed in my mind and I asked myself why I care so much for a person I've never met and, unfortunately, will never meet. I guess one of the main reason is the backstory of her you will learn in the Podcast. Our birthdays are separated by 3 days (yet she is a year older than me) and from what I've heard, she really hated the cold season. Also born in January, I can really confirm this and that this time of the year is also for me the hardest time of the year.

She clearly suffered from a depression and the season was I think a factor for her strange behaviour when she was last seen. What happened after that is, of course, pure speculation.

So, 9 years passed at the end of November 21. I think a little refresher cannot hurt. The Victorian Police released 2 new photos and promised to handle this case still as very important (don't know if this is just PR because they are still riddled with guild that the police offercs had let her go on the day she went missing). Also, the scheduled documentary planned for a release on the 9th anniversary of her disappearance was delayed to 2022 due to the pandemic.

**What happened that day?**

Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home.

Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. 

When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hand. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There’s a bomb, and my dad just blew up!” By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne’s life. He had died almost instantly.

\-----

**Who was Wayne Greavette?**

42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette.

At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. 

\-----

**The Evidence**

This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter.

**The Package**

The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled **[Domaine D’or Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh)**, which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we will get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local.

Apart from this, two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

In the CBC podcast *Someone Knows Something*, the postwoman’s mother (who, alongside her grandson, were riding along as the postwoman did her rounds) said that the package delivered to the Greavette mailbox that day had a very fancy ribbon on it and that it was not at all heavy, as her grandson was able to lift it.

**The Flashlight**

The flashlight used to house the bomb was a Duracell-brand Floating Lantern around 23 cm long and 15 cm tall, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/h7xo02h). According to Justin, the flashlight might have been glued shut, as he was unable to open the flashlight when trying to get it to work. 

A type of mining explosive emulsion called **Superfrac** was used in the bomb. According to investigator Paul Johnson in *Someone Knows Something*, around 1-1.5 pounds (0,5-0,7 kg) of Superfrac was probably used. He also said that Superfrac could be easily bought from the manufacturer without a license, but it was also likely obtained through theft. The bomb was also packed with roofing nails to maximise its destructive effect and was powered by a single-cell AA battery. 

**The Letter and Typewriter**

The letter included in the package was a business proposal and was written by one “William J. French”. In the letter, the writer mentioned that he and his partner were planning to start a new business called “Acton Home Products” in the new year (1997), and that he would like a quote from Greavette on fixing some equipment. The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a [vertical slash](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code ([L7G 2N1](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

However, one thing was chillingly clear: the [postscript](https://imgur.com/a/kH9dxty) of the letter indicated that the writer knew exactly what was going to happen when Wayne switched on the flashlight:

* “Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.**”

\-----

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a [sketch](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

It was suspected (based on the extra postage on the package) that the perpetrator might have dropped the package at a drop-off shoot at the post office or just at a Canada Post mailbox.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

\-----

**Conclusion**

Sunday, 12 December 2021, will be 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a [vertical slash](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code ([L7G 2N1](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

However, one thing was chillingly clear: the [postscript](https://imgur.com/a/kH9dxty) of the letter indicated that the writer knew exactly what was going to happen when Wayne switched on the flashlight:

* “Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.**”
**-----**

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a [sketch](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

It was suspected (based on the extra postage on the package) that the perpetrator might have dropped the package at a drop-off shoot at the post office or just at a Canada Post mailbox.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

\-----

**Conclusion**

Sunday, 12 December 2021, will be 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

First post was removed for “non-standard character”, whatever that meant. Anyway, here’s another go.

**What happened that day?**

Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, \[Wayne Greavette\](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home.

Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a Duracell flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. 

When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight \[exploded\](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hand. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately \[called 911\](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There’s a bomb, and my dad just blew up!” By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne’s life. He had died almost instantly.

\-----

**Who was Wayne Greavette?**

42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette.

At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. 

\-----

**The Evidence**

This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter.

**The Package**

The package was wrapped in \[wrapping paper\](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled \[**Domaine D’or Cabarnet\]**(https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh)**,** which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we will get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a \[flyer\](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at \[700 Main Street East, Milton\](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local.

Apart from this, two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

In the CBC podcast *Someone Knows Something*, the postwoman’s mother (who, alongside her grandson, were riding along as the postwoman did her rounds) said that the package delivered to the Greavette mailbox that day had a very fancy ribbon on it and that it was not at all heavy, as her grandson was able to lift it.

**The Flashlight**

The flashlight used to house the bomb was a Duracell-brand Floating Lantern around 23 cm long and 15 cm tall, similar to \[this\](https://imgur.com/a/h7xo02h). According to Justin, the flashlight might have been glued shut, as he was unable to open the flashlight when trying to get it to work. 

A type of mining explosive emulsion called **Superfrac** was used in the bomb. According to investigator Paul Johnson in *Someone Knows Something*, around 1-1.5 pounds (0,5-0,7 kg) of Superfrac was probably used. He also said that Superfrac could be easily bought from the manufacturer without a license, but it was also likely obtained through theft. The bomb was also packed with roofing nails to maximise its destructive effect and was powered by a single-cell AA battery. 

**The Letter and Typewriter**

The letter included in the package was a business proposal and was written by one “William J. French”. In the letter, the writer mentioned that he and his partner were planning to start a new business called “Acton Home Products” in the new year (1997), and he would like a quote from Greavette on fixing some equipment. The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter \[here\](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

353,[deleted],[],1638994418,,Scuba diving YouTuber discovers submerged car of Tennessee teens who disappeared 21 years ago
354,Johnknowsnothin,[],1638989144,"In 1973 A bank robbery in Swedens capital Stockholm turns into a six day hostage situation. During that time the hostages act in a way not previously observed. The begin to side with the hostages and even ask the police and the prime minister to let the robbers go and to let them, the hostages go with them.  
It culminates in a new psychological concept called The Stockholm syndrome, coined by resident psychiatrist Nils Bejerot who was present at the scene for the entire six days. But was the hostages actions that strange? why did they act the way the did? is the Stockholm syndrome even real?

This is a day by day breakdown of the whole hostage situation:

Sweden had recently begun making regular tv broadcasts and the press was allowed everywhere in so most of the drama is captured on film:  
*here is a video if you'd rather watch:* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOpCfBLjYTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOpCfBLjYTQ) 

  
**DAY 1**  
Its Thursday morning, august 23, 1973. At 10 am a disguised man enters Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, In Stockholm armed with a submachine gun and dynamite. He yells ”the party starts” in English but with a noticeable southern Swedish accent. He’s wearing an wig and sunglasses, a fake mustasch and he’s got shoe cream smeared on his face. he’s trying to appear middle eastern. He fires off some rounds into the ceiling.

One of the tellers presses the alarm button and the police respond.  
But the robber doesn’t go for the money and try to escape. Instead he takes 3 women hostage and wait patiently for the police. He has a plan.

a squad car arrives. When the two officers walk in to the bank the masked bank robber opens fire, hitting one officer in the hand. They retreat.  
The police then arrive and set up up a command center. It looks like it’s going to be a stand off.  
They try to send officers in to the bank once again. But they start shooting and the robber returns fire.  
So the police decide call in to the bank and the robber answers. He has the following demands.

\- 3 million in cash.  
\- A ford mustang, like the one Steve McQueen got in the movie Bullitt  
\- Notorious criminal Clark Olofsson realsed from prison and brought to the bank. (Clark Olofsson was at the time one of Swedens most well known criminals and was serving a 6 year sentence for multiple bank robberies and attempted murder on a police officer)

The police forward the demands to Prime minister Olof Palme and Minister of Justice Lennart Geiger. Their response, yeah sure.

Olofsson is promptly picked up from Norrköpingsanstalten and after being promised a certain deal if he can stop the robbery he’s driven to Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm. Where reporters have gathered outside the bank. They are broadcasting live TV and for the first time in Swedish history there is going to be 24 hour live news coverage.

Meanwhile the police are busy doing three things.  
\- Trying to find out who the mysterious robber is   
\- Giving live interviews on TV and radio on every move they’re going to make  
\- Trying to find different ways to get in to the bank to subdue the robber.

But he seems to be one step ahead of the police at every turn.   
Because he’s listening to the police being interviewed on the radio.

The Police decide to search his known associates and their eye lands on Kaj Hansson, Olofssons former partner in crime, a bank robber, from the south of Sweden (that explains the accent) that is currently on the run from prison. Got him.

**DAY 2**

After being allowed to walk in to the bank the prio evening Olofsson hugged the robber. They’re obviously friends. But the police now have two bank robbers in the bank instead of one. And Olofsson doesn’t convince the robber to give up- Classic backfire.   
Instead he walks around the bank and finds yet another hostage hiding in the back.  
They now have 3 women and one man held captive.

Since police negotiators are not a thing yet the police decide to bring in an expert on prison lingo.  
He calls and using prison slang tries to get them to release the hostages. The robber has no idea what the hell he’s saying. 

Instead Nils bejerot, resident psychiatrist and advisor to the police has a great idea. Bring Kaj Hanssons brother in and let him convince Hansson to give up.   
They find Hanssons brother fly him and his mother to Stockholm. They send him in to the bank while his mother makes a plea live on the radio.

Bejerot escorts the brother to the door and he walks into the bank and down stairs. He’s met with sub machine gun fire. Frightened he runs back up. He doesn’t like the idea of being shot. Bejerot reassures him. ""Tell your brother it’s you, Your brother wouldn’t shoot you"". So he walks down the stairs again only to have bullets wiz by inches from his face and hit the concrete wall behind him.  
The robber yells, get the fuck out of here. Bejerot is confused.  
But then the phone at the command center rings. It’s Kaj Hansson. He calling from a beach in Hawaii and he is very much not the robber. Further more he doesn’t appreciate his name being besmirched (even though he is a bank robber, on the run from a prison sentence for bank robbery).  
He’s promptly arrested by American police and brought back home.

So who’s the robber? The police have been so focused on Kaj Hansson that they’ve ignored tips about another potential suspect.  
His name is Jan-Erik ”Janne” Olsson, a 31 year old small time criminal from Ekeby. (South Sweden it checks out) This time they really have got the right guy. But why is he robbing a bank?   
Well Olsson has just spent a year in prison with Olofsson and he loved the cool stories about Bank robberies Olofsson would tell him.  
So obviously the best thing to do was to break him out of prison and go on a bank robbery tour across the country.

They’re off to a bad start.

**DAY 3**

An officer acting on his own initiative fires his gun a couple of times in to the air to wake up the robbers who are asleep inside the bank. It scares the hell out of the robbers, the hostages the press and the police. Everyone ducks for cover.  
When asked why he did it, he tells reporters that he’s ""kind of a loose cannon"". Great answer.

The requested mustang has arrived and is sitting outside the bank.  
The police have snipers on the roof, ordered to fire if Olsson tries to get to the car. Which is illegal. You can’t shoot somebody who’s running away if they’re not risking a life according the swedish law.

Olsson and Olofsson have retreated to the vault in the basement with the hostages to get away from police. The want to leave with two of them in the car but the police decline the offer. You can go, but without the hostages. The robbers decline the offer. And around they go.  
Until one officer again acting on his own initiative decides to sneak in to the bank and close the vault door.  
The robbers and the hostages are now locked in. without access to food, water or a bathroom.

The press, thirsting for new information during their broadcast realize that there is a phone in the vault. They call and talk to the robbers and the hostages live on TV.  
One of the hostages then uses the phone to call the prime minister.  
She ask him to let the the robbers leave with her in the car. He declines. She explain that the polices erratic behavior is making her feel more unsafe than the robbers are. Our dear prime minister finally says that they don’t negotiate with criminals, but wouldn’t it feel good to die at your post? Like she in the military in a war zone, she works in a bank.  
She says if you don’t want to give the robbers what they want, then you can come down here and trade places with us. Thank you and good bye and then she hangs up the phone.  
Unsurprisingly Palme doesn’t show up to trade places with the hostages.

**DAY 4**

The police decide to drill a hole in the roof of the vault from above to lower down food and water. They call it operation K. Because every good plan has to have a name.

To prevent Operation K Olsson orders one of the hostages to lay down underneath the drill so when police break through the roof she’ll get a big slab of concrete right in her head. Great plan, except the police obviously can’t see in to the vault and they just keep drilling.  
Olsson finally realizes. And she gets to move. When the police break through they send down a camera on a stick to get a look at the place. Then they drop down some food and continue negotiations. Because despite the prime ministers say, they obviously do negotiate with criminals.

The robbers want to leave in the car with the hostages. The police decline. They in turn says that they can leave but without the hostages. The robbers decline. And around they go.

**DAY 5**

You wanna come out? 

Can we bring the hostages

No

Ok, No.

(Basically)

**DAY 6**

The police have been receiving some great tips from the public on how to solve the situation. One person suggest sending a swarm of hornets in to the vault, another to fill it with ping pong balls so they can’t move. Yet Another to just toss a hand grenade down there, that’ll stop the robbers. And Mikael age 10 writes a letter to the police suggesting that they stand over the hole with a gun and shooting the robber when he walks by.  
But the robbers are as always one step ahead. When a young officer stands above the hole, olsson fires a shot hitting him in the hand and the face. He lives.

The police have had it and they decide to use gas to subdue the robbers. What kind of gas? It’s never been established. The police don’t wanna say.

The gas is deployed through the whole in the roof, and within seconds the robber surrender. Two officers with no shirts on open the vault door once it’s unlocked and capture olsson and Olofsson. And the whole ordeal comes to an end after 6 days. 

In the aftermath the following happens.  
It’s discovered that an unknown amount of money is missing from the bank.  
Nils Bejerot explains that since the female hostages sided with the robbers, were okay with going with them in the getaway car and seemed to be afraid of the police they were obviously in love with the robbers and thus the Stockholm syndrome was created.

Janne olsson was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the robbery.  
Clark Olofsson was also sentenced to 5,5 years in prison for the robbery.

Opon appeal he was acquitted when it was discovered that the police had promised him a certain deal. ” if you make sure no hostages are hurt you’ll get a six week furlough from prison. You can rob a bank and flee the country if you want to”. (Actual quote)

**The Stockholm Syndrome:**

One of the stars of the (shit)show was Nils bejerot. The man who almost got Kaj Hanssons brother killed and traumatized him to this day. He was very much involved and giving tips based on his analysis of the robbers psyche throughout the whole drama.   
And when the whole ordeal was over he diagnosed the hostages with what he called Norrmalmstorssyndromet which would later become the stockholm syndrome.

The condition where captives develop positive feelings and a psychological bond with their captors. It is intended to describe a psychological state in which those who are being held hostage begin to relate to their captor and see them as the good guys and the police as the bad guys.

in this case however the behavior of the hostages seems perfectly reasonable, here are just some points that dispute the diagnosis.

\- I understand Olofsson is a bad guy, but you can’t send him in to a hostage situation, what if the robber just wanted him there to kill him. and you definitely can’t charge him with robbery for his trouble. The hostages mention this as sympathetic in subsequent interviews.  
In the aftermath nobody was willing to take responsibility for making the deal with Olofsson or sending snipers up on the roof to take out olsson. Those are unsolved mysteries.

\- Sweden was like one big village in the 70s and crimes of this magnitude was basically non existent. There were no procedures or negotiators until 20 years later in the mid 90s which is was caused most of the problems. police officers just walked around giving interviews and officers not on duty came down just to hang out at the command center. Nobody knew who was giving the orders or which orders to follow and some took matters into their own hands with disastrous (and hilarious) Consequences. This made the police seem erratic and dangerous in the eyes of the hostages.

\- Prime minister Palme talked to the hostages and the robbers for a total of 50 minutes. 20 minutes of that recorded conversation was then edited out. So there’s no proof that he said wouldn’t it be nice to die at your post except for the testimony of the hostages and robbers.   
If you ask me, he definitely said that shit. This statement by the prime minister made the hostages feel like the state and the police where not really trying to save their lives.

From these points it wouldn't seem unreasonable to start to see the police as the bad guys.

Another problem with Bejerots diagnosis is that he never actually met or talked to the victims and one of the hostages Kristin Enemark publicity criticized Bejerot saying that she didn’t develop any psychological bond with the robbers at all. Being friendly and on their side was just her strategy, to avoid being hurt or caught in the crossfire.  
Which actually worked. Olsson later revealed that the bond he developed with the hostages made him unwilling to kill or hurt them.

Stockholm syndrome isn’t part of the DSM-5, and a 2008 literary review revealed that ""most diagnoses \[of Stockholm syndrome\] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists in therapy. 

The whole thing seems dubious at best and it is founded on a complete misunderstanding of the situation and without a clinical diagnosis. So maybe the Stockholm syndrome as a concept should just be left by the way side?

356,mkultra5252,[],1638982392,"At the time of her death in 1986, Christy Lynn Floyd was just 16 years old.

In August 2020, police identified Christy as Chesterfield County Jane Doe, whose body was found on August 7, 1986 in Richmond, Virginia.

Born around 1970, Christy and her older sister Kim grew up together in a foster home in Lexington, Virginia. As the two grew up into young teenagers, they became incredibly close but strived desperately to know their biological mother. Determined, the two sisters one day ran away from their foster home, returning to live with their mom in Richmond.

By all accounts, Christy settled into her new home well. She was kind, sweet, and quiet, and reportedly had a love for animals. In her free time, she could often be found dancing the night away with her sister at a popular teenage hang out spot, The Cellar Door, playing basketball for her high school team, and working at the local Hardee’s to earn some extra cash. 

Two weeks before her disappearance in June 1986, 16-year-old Christy began dating an 18-year-old young man that she had met while working at Hardee’s. The couple evidently fell hard and fast for each other, and Christy ran away from home one night to stay in a hotel with her boyfriend. Her mother immediately realized Christy was missing, so she called the boyfriend’s family to demand that Christy come home or else she would press statutory rape charges since her daughter was a minor. 

Christy complied and returned home the next morning, but she wouldn’t be there for long. Shortly after Christy came home, her mother fell asleep and her sister left to get food. When Kim returned, she found Christy gone, and the home’s back door and alley gate left open. 

Christy’s mother and sister immediately filed a missing person’s report, but felt that police never took their claim seriously. Sadly, two months later on August 7, 1986, workers at a local landfill found the remains that would eventually be identified as Christy while unloading trash collected from a Richmond garbage dumpster. Prior to disposing of her, police believe that Christy’s killer kept her remains in a refrigerator or semi-air tight container to delay decomposition. 

After remaining a Jane Doe for decades, police identified Chesterfield County Jane Doe as Christy in 2020. For years, Kim relentlessly searched for her sister, putting Christy’s face on milk cartons, passing out missing person’s flyers, and submitting her sister’s information to the popular television show “America’s Most Wanted.” In remembering her sister, Kim said, “She was amazing. She was my world. She was like my child, and I feel like I failed her.” 

Her killer is still unknown to this day. Sadly, neither her mother or sister know the identity of the young man Christy was dating and ran away to be with at the time of her disappearance. Anyone with leads is encouraged to contact Chesterfield County Unsolved/Major Investigations Group at 804-717-6024.

After more than three decades, Christy has finally been returned to her family.

&amp;#x200B;

The car of Kyle Clinkscales, an Auburn student who went missing in 1976, has been located in a creek in  Chambers County, Alabama.  Clinkscales was from Georgia, and was a student at Auburn University in Alabama when he disappeared after leaving his bartending job at the Moose Club in LaGrange, Georgia.

[https://www.wrbl.com/news/vehicle-of-missing-auburn-university-student-located-in-44-year-old-cold-case/](https://www.wrbl.com/news/vehicle-of-missing-auburn-university-student-located-in-44-year-old-cold-case/)

There have been several theories and claims made about Clinkscales' disappearance over the years.  In 1981, a man claiming to suffer amnesia due to a 1976 car accident came forward claiming to be Clinkscales, but this was ruled out upon a comparison of dental records.

In 2005, Clinkscales' parents received a phone call from someone who claimed that, as a child, he (the caller) had witnessed his grandfather disposing of a body that had been sealed with concrete inside a barrel.  This phone call led to the investigation of Jimmy Earl Jones and Jeanne Pawlak Johnson, who were both thought to be present during or immediately after the murder of Clinkscales at the hands of a local ne'er do well named Ray Hyde, with Clinkscale's body then being buried in Hyde's salvage yard.  However, searches of Hyde's property did not reveal any remains.  (It's not clear if either Jones or Hyde was the supposed grandfather, and I can't tell if the phone call itself led directly to the investigation of Jones, Johnson, and Hyde, or if it merely got the investigation going again.  /u/beardchester's post, linked below, has much more high-quality information than I have here.)  Hyde was never charged, as this information did not come to light until 2005, by which point Hyde had already died (in 2001).  ~~Johnson~~ Jones, however, was sentenced to 9 years for his role in covering up Clinkscale's death.  (Sorry; I mixed up Johnson and Jones earlier; Jones was the one who served 9 years and has since been released.)

To date, Clinkscales' remains have not been found, and there has been no report yet as to whether there are any human remains in the newly-recovered white 1974 Ford Pinto belonging to Clinkscales.  There is a press conference scheduled for this morning (Wednesday, December 8th); I couldn't find a specific time or link to the scheduled press conference, unfortunately, but hopefully some more information will make its way into the news later today.  One article did report that the sheriff said he'd have ""additional information"" at the press conference, but it wasn't clear if he meant additional info as in, ""evidence or remains we may have found in the car,"" or just ""more details about the process of discovering the car in the creek.""  I hope there's something in the recent discovery of the car that will help in bringing some final resolution to the case; sadly, Kyle's parents have since passed away (his father in 2007, his mother just this year), but it would be nice for Kyle's remains to be found so he could be interred close to his parents.

I know this isn't a ton of new information besides ""they found his car,"" but I recognized Kyle's photo and name immediately when I saw it pop-up in the sidebar of a different news story I was reading, and I wanted to share this update for anyone else who has followed the case.

Still, I want to expand further on it, include more details because of its disturbing nature, and provoke discussion about who could be behind all of this and why she was targeted. 

So, without further ado, this is the unsolved abduction and murder of Maria Bögerl. Pardon my writing skill, as this is my first comprehensive write-up of a single case. Also, English is not my first language.

TW: Suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who was Maria Bögerl?**

[Maria Bögerl](https://www.thelocal.com/20100514/27193/) was a special education teacher and the wife of Thomas Bögerl, a banker and head of a *Kreissparkasse* (a type of local savings bank in Germany). They had two children, Carina (27) and Christoph (24) and the family lived in the Schnaitheim district of Heidenheim, in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

**Timeline of events**

&amp;#x200B;

· **12 May 2010:** 

**Around 10:30 am:** Christoph called Maria at around 10:30 am. He told her that he was on his way home from college, and she asked him what he would like for lunch. This was the last anyone heard from her. Sometime after this call, Maria was kidnapped by person(s) unknown from her house. The kidnapper(s) took her in her car, a black 2009 Mercedes A-Class with the license number HDH-MB 770. 

**Around 11:25 - 11:30 am:** Thomas received a phone call from someone, presumably the kidnapper, asking for a ransom of €300,000 (just under $340,000 in 2021) in specific denominations (I was not able to find which particular denominations were asked for). The caller demanded that the money be dropped off within one and a half hours (around 1 pm). Thomas asked for an extension, which was agreed upon, and the deadline was set at 3 pm. During this call, Thomas was able to speak to his wife for a short time, during which she relayed to him that she had been threatened with death. At this point, Thomas alerted the Heidenheim police.

**3:27 pm:** Thomas managed to secure the ransom money and dropped it at a pre-arranged [spot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B046'09.1%22N+10%C2%B012'35.5%22E/@48.769182,10.209851,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x176d7454081330cc!8m2!3d48.769182!4d10.209851?hl=en) by the A7 Autobahn, marked by a German flag. However, due to delays in obtaining the cash, the drop-off occurred half an hour after the deadline (around 3:27 pm, to be exact). The money was never picked up, and the ransom caller never called again.

&amp;#x200B;

· **14 May 2010:** Maria's car was found abandoned in the parking lot of [Neresheim Abbey](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neresheim+Abbey,+Kloster+11,+73450+Neresheim,+Germany/@48.7558776,10.3415229,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x479924c08000f849:0xb06f8d1d7312fd1f!8m2!3d48.7558741!4d10.3437116), approximately 22 km NW of Heidenheim. Traces of blood were found in the vehicle. Later on, her cellphone was found near the money drop-off site.

Police launched a massive search for Maria, under the belief that she was alive but in extreme danger. More than 350 officers, 100 search dogs, and two helicopters equipped with FLIR cameras were deployed in the search. At one point, members of a local geocaching club and a mountain rescue crew were also involved in the search.

&amp;#x200B;

· **18 May 2010:** The reward for information leading to Maria's return was doubled to €100,000 (just over $110,000 in 2021). A task force called ""Flagge"" (Flag) was formed, and around 80 officers from the *Landeskriminalamt* (State Criminal Investigation Office) were tasked to find Maria.

&amp;#x200B;

· **19 May 2010:** The remaining Bögerl family members (Thomas, his son, and daughter) appeared in the monthly German crime show ""Aktenzeichen XY… ungelöst"" (transl. ""Case number XY...Unsolved) where they plead for Maria's safe return. ""We beg you to help us end this excruciating ordeal on a positive note,"" said Thomas. You can find the segment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XHMaxOV4DU&amp;t=3s), but there is no English sub.

&amp;#x200B;

· **21 May 2010:** The ground search for Maria was suspended. Investigators were now looking into whether a disgruntled customer of the bank where Thomas worked may have been behind the kidnapping.

&amp;#x200B;

· **3 June 2010:** A hiker found the remains of a middle-aged woman covered with branches and leaves in a [forest](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=48.776857,10.199249&amp;z=16&amp;t=m&amp;q=48.776857,10.199249&amp;hl=en) about 10 km north of Heidenheim (and approx. 1 km from the drop-off site). The area where the body was found had been searched weeks prior. A day later, police announced that the body had been positively identified as Maria Bögerl. She had died of multiple stab wounds, and an autopsy showed that she had most likely died within hours of her abduction.

The police also released more details about the ransom caller. The person was described as a male, likely middle-aged and talked with a Swabian accent (Swabia is a region in southern Germany, located about 100 km SE of Heidenheim).

&amp;#x200B;

· **6 June 2010:** The residents of Heidenheim turned out to mourn Maria Bögerl's death. More than 900 people came to pay their respect at a memorial service at the church.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, Maria's murder would not be the end of the Bögerl family's suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

· **11 June 2011:** Just over a year after Maria's body was found, 57-year-old Thomas Bögerl was found dead by his housekeeper around noon. He had committed suicide by hanging himself. He had been battling severe depression following his wife's death, to the point that he had to admit himself into a mental health ward. He left a suicide note behind, the details of which have not been disclosed.

&amp;#x200B;

· **14 June 2011:** Thomas was laid to rest beside his wife. At his funeral, the Bögerl children heavily criticised the media for their handling of the case, particularly for spreading salacious and unfounded rumours about Thomas, both regarding his personal life (how his marriage was pretty much over and that he and Maria were getting a divorce, how he had cheated on her, and how he had fathered an illegitimate child) and his involvement in the crime. None of these rumours was remotely true, but they were enough to get Thomas fired from his job and, by all accounts, pushed him over the edge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The investigation**

&amp;#x200B;

During the initial phase of the investigation (16 May, to be exact), a man was arrested for Maria's kidnapping (it was still considered that at the time). He was let go a short time later. The events that took place during the investigation will be presented in the following timeline:

&amp;#x200B;

· **April 2012:** Police searched an area in the woods near where Maria's body was found. It was not clear what, if anything, was found during the search.

&amp;#x200B;

· **2013:** Following another episode of *Aktenzeichen XY* discussing the case, a man came forward claiming to have information about the case. This turned out to be false; the man was lying to the police for seven months. He was eventually found out, arrested, and sentenced to 2 years probation for fraud (he was given €5,000 for the false information he provided).

&amp;#x200B;

· **20 January 2014:** Investigators announced that a DNA dragnet would be initiated around the area where Maria's car was found (the Neresheim Abbey), which would start in February 2014. All men born between 1 January 1945 and 31 December 1992 (between 23-69 years old) and living in the area between 1 January 2010 and late October 2013 would be asked to give a sample of their DNA voluntarily. This translated to around 3,000 people who would be included in the dragnet.

&amp;#x200B;

· **14 February 2014:** The aforementioned DNA dragnet was initiated.

· **August 2014:** The DNA dragnet was widened to include men between 21-68 in [Giengen an der Brenz]( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Giengen,+Germany/@48.6172309,10.1751832,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47993f206aa0c70f:0x2e0a95b369c17178!8m2!3d48.6223985!4d10.2391536), around 15 km SE of Heidenheim. Around 5,000 people were asked to submit a DNA sample.

&amp;#x200B;

· **January 2016:** Task Force ""Flagge"" was disbanded. The investigation was transferred to a smaller team at the Ulm Police Service.

&amp;#x200B;

· **5 April 2017:** The *Bundeskriminalamt* (BKA), Germany's federal criminal investigative body, announced that a suspect is being sought for Maria's murder. The suspect was a 45-year-old man from Königsbronn, located just north of Heidenheim. He was around 180 cm (6 ft) tall, with black hair, stubble, and a mole under his right eye. He was described as appearing unkempt.

On 26 July 2016, the man had drunkenly approached two passersby in the town of Hagen (located in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia). He started confessing to them that he was involved in Maria's murder. The man's confession was recorded by one of the passersby. When the police arrived, the man was gone. The BKA claimed that the man had talked about the crimes that were withheld from the public. [This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20170405171122/https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/UnbekanntePersonen/PPUlm\_Mord\_MB/MB.html) contains a composite picture of the man.

&amp;#x200B;

· **6 April 2017:** The BKA announced that a man had been arrested for Maria's murder. It was indeed the man described in the appeal released the day prior. The man was mentally unstable and admitted that he hated the Bögerl family. However, the man was released without charges later that day. His DNA did not match the sample taken from the crime scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Allegations and Grave Mistakes.**

&amp;#x200B;

Could Maria's life have been saved? According to a [report](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/fall-boegerl-polizeipanne-kein-loesegeld-wegen-mittagspause-1.982889) by *Stern* magazine, yes. The report suggests that police did not alert the nearest *Bundesbank* (a branch of the German Central Bank) in Ulm, about 30 km SW of Heidenheim, about the fact that they would require them to prepare €300,000 to pay the kidnapper(s) (the *Bundesbank* is the designated institution where law enforcement would get the ransom in cases of kidnapping). As a result, the bank was closed for a lunch break, as was usually the case, when two employees of *Kreissparkasse Heidenheim* (where Thomas worked) arrived at the *Bundesbank* at 1:15 pm. It took another half an hour (1:45 pm) for the employees to acquire the money. By the time Thomas dropped the money off beside the A7, he was half an hour late.

The police, on the other hand, [claimed]([https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/mord-an-bankiersfrau-polizei-dementiert-vorwuerfe-im-fall-boegerl-a-699544.html](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/mord-an-bankiersfrau-polizei-dementiert-vorwuerfe-im-fall-boegerl-a-699544.html)) that Thomas was to blame for the late drop-off.  They said Thomas insisted on getting the money himself, without the police involved. They also said he refused to leave for the drop-off site with only a partial ransom (less than €300,000) and a note explaining the situation, even though the 3 pm deadline was fast approaching. Thomas steadfastly denied these allegations.

The Bögerl children also accused the police of failing to help their father. In a 2012 [interview](https://www.zeitenspiegel.de/de/projekte/interview/vom-ende-einer-familie/article/) with the *Stern* magazine, they presented their version of events and alleged that the process was bungled from the start because Thomas was left entirely alone to gather the cash for the ransom. According to Carina Bögerl, the head of Task Force ""Flagge"", said at one point, ""If a bank director cannot do that (i.e. get the ransom money), who can?"" 

In the same interview, it was also revealed that police had developed tunnel vision for Christoph Bögerl and Carina's live-in partner. They suspected that both had contacted the kidnapper(s) in the days leading to the kidnapping. The police searched their houses and tapped both Christoph's and Carina's partner's cellphones, and many calls were recorded, including those with a priest and a lawyer. Their suspicions were soon proven wrong, as they were based on data stored with incorrect timestamps on their phones. Following these revelations, the prosecuting authority in charge of the case announced that no one in the Bögerl family was being investigated as a suspect.

The Bögerl children also admitted that in retrospect, their appearance in the *Aktenzeichen XY* episode did more harm than good, as it only fuelled the fire on the theory that the family was somehow involved in Maria's disappearance.

Then there was the matter about Maria's body. The place where her remains were found had been searched some time prior. It was suggested through the autopsy that Maria had died not long after she was abducted and that her body had spent a considerable amount of time at the dumping location. Which led to the question, why wasn't her body discovered during the earlier search?

The police also seemed to have completely dropped the ball with trivial things. The ransom money remained where it was dumped until the following day (13 May), when they were removed, not by police or the kidnapper(s), but by highway maintenance workers. Also, it took the police four months to start looking for forensic evidence in the garage where Maria's car was on the day of the kidnapping, and that happened only after the family repeatedly asked them to do it. Christoph also claimed that he only found out about his mother's body being discovered by reading the news, not by anyone from the investigation telling him directly.

All of this is just a very long way of saying that, no matter how you paint it, there were massive errors made by law enforcement in the initial stage of the investigation. And Maria paid for those errors with her life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&amp;#x200B;

More than 11 years have passed since Maria Bögerl was kidnapped and killed. The police have plenty of leads and DNA evidence, but the perpetrator(s) is/are still on the lam. 

Which leads us back to the question at the top: who kidnapped Maria Bögerl and murdered her in cold blood?

From NBC:

&gt;A woman who was likely murdered and had her body dumped in a Davie canal in 1975 has remained unidentified for nearly 46 years, but now cold case investigators say they've identified her.

&gt;The woman's body was discovered in a canal in the 2600 block of Southwest 154th Avenue on Dec. 23, 1975.

&gt;At a news conference Tuesday, Davie Police said they identified her as Carolyn Dunn Moudy, of Indianola, Mississippi.

&gt;Moudy's daughter, Edna, spoke briefly at the news conference to thank investigators.

&gt;""I just thank God that I got courage and know now, cause all these years I was just trying to search for her but I'm just thankful,"" Edna Moudy said. ""She's in my heart.""

&gt;Last year, police had released a digital composite of the unidentified woman. Officials said advances in DNA technology helped identify her as Moudy.

&gt;A genetic genealogist was able to use the DNA to track down family members, who said Moudy had gone missing in July 1974.

&gt;A local anthropologist talks about the work she did with police to create a digital facial approximation of a woman who was murdered back in 1975. NBC 6's Alyssa Hyman reports.

&gt;Police had previously said the Broward Medical Examiner’s Office had determined the cause of death was drowning and the circumstances surrounding the case suggested homicide.

&gt;Officials said Tuesday that a homicide investigation is ongoing.

&gt;""Our detectives were relentless in identifying Carolyn and will now work towards bringing justice to her and her family as this investigation continues,"" Davie Police Chief Steve Kinsey said.

I see a lot of cases get brought up on this thread as 'unsolved' despite the fact that there has already been a conviction made. People are absolutely wrongly accused and convicted of crimes, but I don’t think it is as prevalent as people may believe. 

I also think that some cases ([Steven Avery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Avery) comes to mind) have such bad police practices that it taints the evidence and leads to doubt. Other cases rely on a lot of circumstantial evidence ([Scott Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Peterson)) and once again, I think that puts doubt in people’s minds (I was one of those people until I started listening to [The Prosecutors Podcast](https://prosecutorspodcast.com/) and their explanations of circumstantial evidence has really made me see the value of it).

Out of all these cases however, are there any that you do truly believe the person convicted is innocent? Or even the person found innocent is actually guilty?","There are a lot of solved cases that get brought up on this thread. Are there any of those cases that you truly feel like are still unsolved, despite there being a conviction/trial?"
363,moondog151,[],1638919525,"It was November 28, 2008, and excavators alongside other workers were mobilized to the Daehangno neighbourhood of Seoul The South Korean Capital. The reason for the excavators being sent was to work on the demolition of the main office of The Korea International Cooperation Agency in that neighbourhood. As they carried out their work one of the workers noticed a pile of human bones at the bottom of a dirt pit located in the basement of the building. All the workers soon halted their work and notified the police.

The police soon arrived and started a murder investigation suspecting that the bones belonged to a single dismembered body as the remains were cut up. However they soon changed this hypothesis after determining that the bones belonged to 10-15 different bodies, so the police instead just informed the prosecution that this was just a strange unnatural death and that the matter likely wasn't a criminal matter or if it was it would've been too old for any suspects to be arrested due to either already being dead or due to the statute of limitations.

The question however remained. Who were these people and why were they buried in a mass grave?

Various theories have been considered some more likely than others.

After the police determined it not to be a criminal investigation the first seriously considered hypothesis is that the remains belonged to Korean soldiers killed in the Korean War.

The site where The Korea International Cooperation Agency Office Building once lay was the site of a violent battle between North and South Korean forces with the North Korean military attempting to invade the city of Seoul while the South Korean forces tried to repel them. During the war and invasion the North Korean army would kill any wounded South Korean soldiers and anti-communist they came across. Once word of this discovery reached them the South Korean army known as the ROK sent a KIA Recovery and Identification team to the site to conduct an investigation and possibly identify the soldiers.

The KIA team stayed at the site for only 14 days before leaving. They determined that these were unlikely to be the remains of ROK soldiers killed in battle. They came to this conclusion because there were no artifacts at the scene to substantiate this claim. Nowhere on the remains or in the surrounding area did the KIA recover any firearms, bullets, combat uniforms or accessories. Furthermore, when the remains themselves were inspected there were no gunshot wounds or any other wounds that would indicate that these people died in combat. That's not to say that nothing was recovered at the scene though as during the excavation of the site a Japanese ink bottle and the sole of a boot were found. However, this sole did not belong to the boots worn by American or ROK troops. Furthermore, the remains did not match the body type or age that most ROK soldiers were with women and even a child being amongst the remains.

After this, the third suggested theory was that these belonged to civilians massacred by North Korean Troops or prisoners and political dissidents that the ROK and police killed soon after the Korean War ended.

After this was suggested The Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission was contacted to investigate the mass grave however they soon dismissed this theory as well for much the same reason that the KIA dismissed their theory. There was no evidence or nothing left behind such as bullets that would align with this being a civilian massacre as well as there being no gunshot wounds on any of the bodies. Truth and Reconciliation Commission soon closed their investigation determining that these were not civilians will by the ROK back when South Korea was a dictatorship.

The KIA and The Truth and Reconciliation Commission both believed that these remains belonged to medical cadavers likely from The Seoul National University that had been disposed of (And thus not a matter that warranted their involvement) so the police decided to launch an investigation however they found out that the university cremated all their cadavers and had surviving records to prove this meaning that yet again this theory had to be ruled out.

It was then suggested that these were the remains of Koreans that the Imperial Japanese Empire/Army committed biological experiments on during wartime and occupation. Or that they were medical cadavers used by the Kyungsung Imperial University

This was the last suggested theory to explain the mass grave however yet again it seemed it was not to be. There seemed to be no surviving records that the Japanese buried the remains of their experimentation subjects at this site and furthermore, when the bodies were examined further they showed no traces of being infected by any sort of pathogens or disease.

And as for the now-defunct Kyungsung Imperial University, their records seemed to survive and there was no evidence that a child was amongst the cadavers they tested on. Furthermore, after the liberation of Korea from Japan, their cadavers were recovered and all were cremated and given a funeral.

Eventually, the police who had been doing most of the investigation handed all the remains over to The National Forensic Service and on March 26, 2009, they finally came to a conclusion.

Based on the fact that a medical saw was used to dismember some of the bodies The National Forensic Service disagreed with the police's assessment and figured that the bodies were in fact cadavers from the Kyungsung Imperial University. They also determined that the site they were found in was not the site of their deaths and that the police's initial count of 10 - 15 remains was inaccurate and that there were 28 bodies at the site instead. They came to this conclusion because after reassembling all of the skeletons they realized that there were some bones not belonging to a complete body and that the DNA test returned 28 characteristics. The conclusions also shed more light on the remains.16 of the remains belonged to adults.

1 belonged to a young adult male.

11 belonged to children (including infants) with 4 of the children being male, 5 female and 2 unidentified.

The estimated time of their deaths was 50 - 100 years ago.

Some animal bones were mixed with the human remains.

As mentioned a saw is believed to be the instrument used to dismember the bodies.

None of the bodies seemed to be related to one another and there were no signs of murder on any of them.

Officially the case is considered closed with the remains being determined to belong to cadavers from The Kyungsung Imperial University however this case is still labelled by many others to be unsolved or at least not fully resolved such as the Kyungsung Imperial University bodies being cremated, no records of a mass grave at this site by the Japanese and the remains showing no signs of illness or infection by pathogens. And regardless of what theory is correct all of these bodies remain unidentified.

Eventually, it seems that this theory presented by The National Forensic Service was also dismissed as the case was handed to the district office who closed their investigation without ever giving a clear conclusion and in May 2021 this case was talked about on TV by the SBS Current Affairs Program which yet again treated this incident as unsolved.

The remains were likely cremated in 2019

**Circumstances of Disappearance:**

Laureen resided with her mother, Judith Rahn, in a third-floor apartment on Merrimack Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. She was a student at Parkside Junior High School and made good grades.

Judith's then-boyfriend was a professional tennis player, and he and Judith were out of town at a tennis tournament when Laureen disappeared on April 26, 1980. She normally accompanied them, but that day she had asked to be allowed to stay home and her mother agreed. This was during spring break at Laureen's school.

That evening, Laureen, a male friend and a female friend spent some time drinking beer and wine in Laureen's apartment. The boy later stated he heard voices in the hallway and left through the back door because he thought Judith was coming home and he was afraid he would get in trouble. He heard Laureen lock the door behind him.

When Judith arrived home at midnight, she noticed that the light bulbs in hallways on all three floors of the apartment building had been unscrewed and everything was dark. Her own apartment's front door was unlocked. Judith checked Laureen's room and thought she saw her in bed.

In the morning, however, Judith discovered that it was not Laureen but her girlfriend asleep in her room. Laureen was gone, her clothes and brand new sneakers were in the living room, and the back door was open. Her friend stated she'd last seen her sleeping on the couch.

Although the police initially suspected Laureen was a runaway, Judith didn't believe her daughter had left on her own because Laureen had left behind her clothes and purse. Within a few weeks investigators reconsidered the runaway theory. They stated it appeared as if Laureen had left the apartment willingly and intended to return within a short time.

Judith discovered that she had been charged for three California phone calls on October 1, 1980, three months after Laureen disappeared. Judith did not have any friends or relatives in California at the time, and Laureen had never lived there and had no ties to the area.

Two of the calls had been placed from a motel in Santa Monica to another motel in Santa Ana. The third call was placed to a teen sexual assistance hotline. The physician who maintained the hotline at first denied knowing anything about it, but in 1985 he changed his story.

The doctor said that numerous runaway girls occasionally visited his wife at their home and one of the young women may have been from New Hampshire. The individual claimed that Annie Sprinkle, a woman who allegedly worked with his wife in the fashion industry, may have had information concerning several runaways. Authorities learned that Sprinkle was involved in the pornography industry, and they scanned several of her films in an attempt to locate Laureen. No evidence linking Sprinkle to Laureen's disappearance was discovered and she has never been implicated in her case.

An investigator visited California on Judith's behalf in 1986 and located the two motels involved in the October 1980 phone calls. Authorities said that one of the establishments may have been used by a child pornographer named ""Dr. Z."" Investigators were unable to link ""Dr. Z"" to the teen hotline and it is not known if child sexual abuse images were involved in Laureen's disappearance.

Roger Maurais, Laureen's childhood friend in Manchester, received a call from a woman identifying herself as ""Laurie"" or ""Laureen"" in 1986. Maurais's mother answered the call and said that the person claimed to be her son's former girlfriend. The caller's identity remains unknown.

One of Laureen's family members reported seeing a girl matching her description in a Boston, Massachusetts bus terminal in 1981. For about a year after Laureen disappeared, her mother frequently got mysterious phone calls. They always came at approximately 3:45 a.m. and the caller would never say anything.

Judith continued to receive phone calls around the Christmas holidays for several years from an unknown individual. She said that the person listened silently when Laureen's sister answered the phone, then terminated the call shortly afterwards. The calls stopped after Judith changed her phone number several years after Laureen vanished.

A witness reported that a prostitute in Anchorage, Alaska matched Laureen's description. The unconfirmed sighting occurred in 1988 and authorities said that the witness based his recollections on her 1980 photo. The woman was not believed to have been Laureen as a result of the time lapse.

The boy who was drinking alcohol with Laureen on the night of her disappearance committed suicide in 1985. He was never considered a suspect in her case.

Judith moved to Florida during the years after Laureen's disappearance and remarried. She believes that her daughter placed the three California phone calls in October 1980.

Laureen enjoyed singing and dancing at the time of her disappearance and dreamed of becoming an actress. Judith believes she is still alive and some of Laureen's acquaintances may know more about her disappearance than they disclosed in 1980. Investigators continue to suspect that foul play was involved in her case, which remains unsolved.

Denise Daneault, a 25-year-old woman who lived just two blocks from Laureen, disappeared six weeks after Laureen did and was never found. She and Laureen reportedly closely resembled each other in spite of the difference in their ages, but it has never been shown that their disappearances were linked.

Some agencies may list April 27, 1980 as the date of Laureen's disappearance.

Twenty-one years ago in 2000, Erin Foster (18) and Jeremy Bechtel (17) were last seen in Erin's 1998 black Pontiac Grand Am. It was 10 PM on April 3rd in White County, Tennesse and they were leaving a party. It was the last anyone ever saw either of them.

Over the years there were many rumors and false leads about the two. There were several reported sightings that lead police on a wild goose chase as far as Pensacola, Florida. There were even stories that they'd been murdered and their bodies dumped in an abandoned well, never to be found.

Unfortunately, it appears that they lost control of their vehicle going around a bend in the road and ended up submerged in the Calfkiller River.

[Charline Rosemond ](https://uncovered.com/cases/charline-rosemond)was a fun and active,  23 year old, who lived in Everett, Massachusetts with her family. Charline worked for a Toyota dealership for nearly two year before her death—and was known for her dedication to her job. She took an interest in cosmetology and was looking forward to being an aunt soon.

**The day Charline went missing.** Charline last spoke with her family on the morning of April 6th, 2009. Charline was borrowing her father’s car, since she was having car troubles and hoping to purchase another new one. Charline and her mother discussed returning the car home later that night as her father needed it that evening. Charline obliged,[ as she had recently saved up $4,000 to purchase a Lexus](https://uncovered.com/cases/charline-rosemond/timeline) from a friend who said they would help her get a car at a discounted rate. Later that same day, Charline had plans to look at the car—with cash in hand. She told her mother she’d be home later that night after looking at the car.

However, that evening, Charline never returned home. The following morning, Charline’s parents asked Charline’s sister, Roserlie if she spoke to Charline since she did not come home. Regardless, it was very out of character for Charline to not return the car to her parents like she promised which was a reason for concern. Roserlie called Charline’s phone only to get her voicemail, before calling Charline’s friends to see if any of them knew where her sister was, only to find that none of them were with Charline. Roserlie called Charline’s job because she knew that her sister took a lot of pride in her job, and assumed she would be clocking into her 7am shift. However, there was no sign of Charline. 

By 11am on April 7th, Roserlie and her father decide to go to the Somerville Police police station to report Charline missing. At first, law enforcement dismissed the urgency of Charline’s disappearance telling the family to wait 48 hours before filing a report. This did not sit well with Roserlie, who at eight months pregnant decided to drive around to the spots she knew her sister would frequent. [She spoke to two different friends of Charline who, according to her, both seemed to have very little interest in Charline’s disappearance](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/black-girl-gone-a-true-crime-p-1628420/episodes/unsolved-the-murder-of-charlin-95047785). On April 8th, an official missing persons report was filed.

**When she was discovered.** On April 13th–six days after Charline went missing—Roserlie got a call from a friend telling her to speak to the Somerville Police department.  At the same time, a relative of Roserlie’s father called and spoke to Roserlie’s brother-in-law. When the call ended, Roserlie’s brother-in-law had to inform the family that police had found Charline’s body. [She was discovered in her father’s 2001 grey Honda Civic in an alley near the Mid Night Convenience store with a bullet wound to the head. ](http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/15/missing_everett_woman_23_found_dead_in_somerville/)Law enforcement believe that two assailants were involved; one who entered on the passenger seat and the shooter who was in the back seat of the car. Charline’s family believe she was killed because of the $4,000 cash she had on her at the time to purchase her new car, as the money was never recovered from the scene. 

**Where the case stands today.** In 2019, a suspect was arrested under two counts of perjury in relation to Charine’s case for providing false information. This individual was arraigned on $100,000 bail. However, there has been no further movement in the case, and now, it has been over 11 years since Charline was killed and Roserlie and her family are still actively seeking justice for Charline.

I know its been covered ad nauseum, but I did a write-up for [my newsletter](https://fromthemessengerbag.substack.com/about?sort=about) where I analyze the evidence and try to pick what I think happened. 

My newsletter is free, always will be, and to prove it, I'm uploading the full post here. Enjoy! 

...

Imagine this. It's the 24th of July, 1989. You're sweating in the  shade of a birch tree near Mt. Asahidake in Hokkaido, Japan.  You've been lost for a few days now, and you're starting to feel  delirious.  You look over at your friend,  and he smiles back at you  reassuringly. 

""They have to have a team out already. Someone will find us."" He almost sounds like he believes it. 

Suddenly,  you become aware of the deafening sound of helicopter rotors overhead.  You've never heard such a sweet sound in your life. You run out into the  clearing, waving your hands. Your friend is shouting up at them as  well, trying to get their attention. 

They see you and begin to  descend slowly onto a flat part of the mountainside. You realize you're  crying tears of joy as you run to the clearing, pushing your exhausted  muscles to their spent limit. 

A rescuer embraces you tightly after they've landed. He begins talking to you, his voice a friendly and pleasing baritone. 

""Don't worry. You're safe now. We'll take you back to your families and homes.""

It's music to your ears. Then he says something else. 

""It's a good thing you two made that SOS sign nearby or we might have never known where to look.""

You  look at your friend who breaks off a drink of water to return the eye  contact. You both exchange a look of confusion before you turn to the  rescuer and say, ""What SOS sign?""

...

In the summer of 1989, a Japanese search crew found a giant SOS sign  made from birch trees that had been cut down and laid to make the  letters. Spotting the sign enabled the rescue team to find the man and  his friend after they'd gone missing. But after establishing the man and  his friend didn't make the sign, Japanese authorities were puzzled. Who  made this sign, and why? And were they ever saved? 

In the days following the rescue, the authorities made several puzzling discoveries. 

Investigating  the sign itself, they looked at aerial photographs the Japanese  Forestry Service takes every five years of the area, and saw a  reflection on a photo that the sign existed in 1987. The same reflection  could not be seen on the photo taken in 1982. Close to the sign, police  found a full human skeleton with gnaw marks on some of the bones,  indicating some scavenging had occurred. The skeleton had fractures in  its right shoulder, and left thigh. The coroner concluded that these  were present when the person was alive, and upon further examination,  the conclusion was made that the bones belonged to a woman, with a blood  type of O. 

In the vicinity of the body, police found a backpack  containing three cassette tapes, a Sony tape recorder, some basic  hygiene implements, and one ID card issued to a man named **Kenji Iwamura.** 

These  two findings seem to contradict one another. The bones belonging to a  woman, and the backpack being found near the body implying it belonged  to the deceased containing the ID card of a man. It gets more odd. 

The  first two cassette tapes were anime soundtracks, and the last was a  recording of a man calling for help. The message, according to [barelysociable's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/snWvNkJCCs8), is translated as such: 

""I can't move on the cliff, SOS help me.

I can't move on the cliff, SOS help me. 

The place is where I first met the helicopter.

I can't go up deeply Sasa.

Lift me from here."" 

You  would be forgiven if the translation confused you, because it isn't  great. The obvious questions are going to surround the line ""I can't go  up deeply Sasa"" so let's answer those from the jump. Sasa is a type of  dense, running bamboo that grows around Mt. Asahidake, the setting for  our mystery. The translation seems to imply that because of the Sasa  growth in the area, the person on the tape is unable to move up the  cliff to higher ground. 

The next line I want to examine is ""The  place is where I first met the helicopter."" In this line, the recorder  is telling us that he saw a helicopter, perhaps tried to get it's  attention, and then it flew off before he could be rescued. 

While  it seems odd to have taped this recording, it's been pointed out and  noted that doing so would have allowed the recorder to be able to play  it repeatedly for hours while conserving their own strength for other  endeavors. 

When Japanese authorities presented their findings  (the backpack, the recorder, and the ID card) to Mr. Iwamura's parents,  the parents were able to confirm that the backpack, as well as the  contents, belonged to their son. They were not able to confirm, however,  that it was their son on the tape recording. 

Upon discovering  the contents of the backpack, the police re-evaluated their conclusion  of to whom the bones belonged. This closer look revealed that the bones  actually belonged to a man, with a blood type of A. Which would seem to  indicate the bones belonged to Kenji Iwamura. 

Mr. Kenji Iwamura  was an office worker who went missing on a hike near Mt. Asahidake in  1984. Along the trail he was hiking, there are two rocks that serve as  landmarks. The first is called the Fake Safe Rock, because it looks like  the actual landmark, but if you depart the trail here you end up along  the ridgeline where we found our first two hikers, and subsequently, Mr.  Iwamura's final resting place. The second landmark is the ""Safe Rock""  which is the actual landmark that marks the impending end of the trail. 

Japanese  authorities did search for Iwamura after he failed to show up for work a  week later, and were unable to locate him or his remains in that  search. 

Finally, the coroner's report indicated that Mr. Iwamura  would have had his fractured shoulder and thigh while he was alive. On  top of that, the authorities stated that Mr. Iwamura's frame would have  been ""totally spent"" after laying just eight logs for the sign. I  haven't seen a number exactly, but the sign itself seems to be made of  much more than just eight logs. **On top of that,** there was no axe or hatchet found with Mr. Iwamura's things. So how did the trees get cut down? 

Now that we have our facts, let's look at our theories. 

**#1. Kenji Iwamura made the sign.** 

Each  of the facts seem to indicate that Mr. Iwamura couldn't have made the  sign, right? He had broken bones, was too small, and had no woodcutting  implements. And yet, this is still the theory I'm arguing for, why? 

Let's  start with the woodcutting implements. Mr. Iwamura's body went  undiscovered for five years before it was found, it's not impossible to  think a small hatchet is still laying in wait, waiting to be found. Or  that it was found already and picked up by some unsuspecting hiker.  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 

The coroner  report I mentioned earlier said that Mr. Iwamura would have been too  weak to lay the number of logs necessary to make the SOS sign. Maybe in a  day. But Mr. Iwamura was gone **a week** before he was  reported missing and people started looking for him. If he lays 9 logs a  day over 6 days, that's 54 logs. Not easily doable, but it doesn't seem  so far fetched now. 

Lastly, the bone fractures occurred while he  was alive, but that doesn't mean necessarily they happened immediately.  Mr. Iwamura could have been hurt by a falling tree (logging is an  extremely dangerous industry) towards the end of his log-laying  endeavor. His backpack was found in a hole under some tree roots, which  could have operated as a resting area for Mr. Iwamura while he waited to  be rescued. 

*But, what about the tape that his parents couldn't say was him or not?*

Mr.  Iwamura's parents might not have been able to identify their son's  voice, but how often would they have heard him yell? The recording,  which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/-smTubVC4ec)  (warning: eerie), has a man repeatedly shouting very slow, very clear  instructions. He breathes before almost every syllable. By all accounts,  Mr. Iwamura was friendly but not gregarious or overly expressive, so  the likelihood that someone ever heard him yell before that tape is  minimal, and it had been five years since his parents had even heard his  voice. Their memory of it might not have been extremely crisp. The  recording was found in a bag with all of Iwamura's things, so it seems  more likely its him on the recording, and he would play it on loop while  he worked to cut down trees all day. 

Finally, the timeline fits.  The aerial photo taken in 1982 didn't have the SOS sign on it because  Mr. Iwamura wouldn't go missing for another two years. It shows up in  the 1987 photo because Mr. Iwamura made it in 1984 shortly after he went  missing. 

**#2. It's a hoax.** 

There are a  few holes in almost any theory that's presented. So it occurred to me  while researching this case that things aren't adding up because they  aren't supposed to. Mr. Iwamura wasn't physically capable of making the  sign, so he didn't. There wasn't a chopping tool found because none was  left behind. Kenji Iwamura's parents couldn't identify the man on the  tape because it wasn't their son. 

Short of just throwing  circumstantial evidence at the wall, specifically regarding ""this is  what's possible"", there is no real clean summation of this case if Mr.  Iwamura wasn't the sign's creator. 

So maybe it was a hoax. Some elaborate prank made by someone with a sick sense of humor. 

But then how could Mr. Iwamura's body and belongings end up so close by pure coincidence? 

Too many holes in this theory to be seriously viable. 

**#3. ALIENS**

No, I'm just kidding, blaming the whole thing on aliens is too low effort. 

In  summation, Mr. Iwamura may have been unable to save himself, but his  hard work endured long after his body didn't. And subsequently, that  work saved two people's lives a half decade later.  So while the  evidence doesn't fully support the sign's creator being Kenji Iwamura,  it definitely doesn't support it being anyone else either. 

It's at least viable that it was Mr. Iwamura, and that's the prevailing theory!",The Japanese SOS Incident -- again

The case is neatly summed up in this newspaper article from eight years ago. Cursory googling does not seem to reveal any new developments. Can we do better?

From the Guardian 

The University of Texas at Austin is missing about 100 brains — about half of the specimens the university had in a collection preserved in jars of formaldehyde.

One of the missing brains is believed to have come from clock tower sniper Charles Whitman.

“We think somebody may have taken the brains but we don’t know at all for sure,” psychology Professor Tim Schallert, co-curator of the collection, told the Austin American-Statesman.

His co-curator, psychology Professor Lawrence Cormack, said: “It’s entirely possible word got around among undergraduates and people started swiping them for living rooms or Halloween pranks.”

The Austin State Hospital had transferred the brains to the university about 28 years ago under a “temporary possession” agreement. Schallert said his psychology lab had room for only 100 brains, so the rest were moved to the basement of the university’s Animal Resources Center.

“They are no longer in the basement,” Cormack said.

The university said in a statement that it would investigate “the circumstances surrounding this collection since it came here nearly 30 years ago” and that it was “committed to treating the brain specimens with respect”. It says the remaining brain specimens on campus are used “as a teaching tool and carefully curated by faculty”.

The university’s agreement with the hospital required the school to remove any data that might identify the person from whom the brain came. However Schallert said Whitman’s brain likely was part of the collection.

“It would make sense it would be in this group. We can’t find that brain,” he said.

Whitman’s 1966 rampage, which culminated at the University of Texas, killed 16 people, including his mother and wife. Eleven of the victims were fatally shot by Whitman who had barricaded himself on the observation deck of the University of Texas Tower before he was killed by police.

The 100 remaining brains at the school had been moved to the Norman Hackerman Building, where they were being scanned with high-resolution resonance imaging equipment, Cormack said.

“These MRI images will be both useful teaching and research tools. It keeps the brains intact,” he told the newspaper.

Story continues  from New York Times Dec 2014

There were some reports the brains had been found. Early Tuesday afternoon, there were reports that the missing brains had turned up at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. These have since been discounted.

“We have no evidence that any brain specimens were shared with other universities or health institutions,” the statement said, adding that there was also no evidence that one of the brains destroyed came from Charles Whitman, the tower sniper whose 1966 rampage terrorized the campus and killed 16.

According to the statement, the university will investigate why some of the specimens were disposed of and how all of them had been handled since the university received the collection.

Last year in Indianapolis, David Charles, 21, was charged with stealing 60 human brains from the Indiana Medical History Museum. The police were tipped off by Brian Kubasco of San Diego, who had bought six of the brains on eBay for $600, and suspected they were stolen. About 48 of the brains were returned to the museum, which is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital. All of the brains were from the autopsies of mental patients over roughly a half-century through the 1940s.

“These brain collections go back to the mid-1800s, and it’s not uncommon for their whereabouts to be unclear,” said Brian Burrell, a University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor and author of “Postcards From the Brain Museum: The Improbable Search for Meaning in the Matter of Famous Minds.”

Disposing of such a collection can be awkward, he said, since it may not be possible to give away the brains. Sometimes, he said, an institution does not even know it has them.

EBay policy prohibits the sale of human remains, with the exception of hair and skulls, as well as skeletons sold for medical use. But enforcement is not air tight, as evidenced by the Indiana case.

While a federal law protecting the burial sites of Native Americans prohibits trade in Indian funeral objects and human remains, it is generally left to the states to regulate the trade of remains.

Some extensive collections of brains have simply vanished.

“There was one collection of 600 brains, by a Philadelphia anatomist, and no one knows where they are,” Mr. Burrell said.",A cold case that for once does not involve a terrible murder... **100 ABNORMAL BRAINS DISAPPEAR IN TEXAS!!**

384,Benjilikethedog,[],1638813316,Like most people in the modern western world it strikes me as weird that a John or Jane Doe could happen in 2021… with the amount of smart phones and social media we have nowadays the ability to disappear just seems impossible until I started reading a book by a former sports writer at The Washington Post entitled [“Leave Out The Tragic Parts”](https://www.amazon.com/Leave-Out-Tragic-Parts-Grandfathers/dp/1541757068) about how his grandson became a “traveler” or what amounts to a modern day wanderer and the lifestyle that existence entails including the use of nicknames which got me thinking about [“Mostly Harmless”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Vance_Rodriguez) and also [this post](https://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1411453/1/screen) about an unidentified woman in the middle of the desert in the American South West. The book actually goes into some detail about the community of the travelers in the United States and I thought it would be worth sharing considering that John and Jane Doe posts are fairly common in this subreddit,I wanted to share a book recommendation to help explain how a John/ Jane Doe can happen in 2021

Samantha worked as a street prostitute and St Kilda was the centre of prostitution in Melbourne prior to gentrification from the 1990’s onwards.

Around 9.50pm on Tuesday 29th March, Samantha was seen by two witnesses on Brighton Road, St Kilda, near Blanche Street, speaking to an unknown man. The pair had a short conversation before walking off together towards Blanche Street.  The man seen speaking to Samantha that night has been described as being between 40-45 years of age, of Caucasian appearance, about 182cm tall with a thin build and short grey hair that was parted to the left. At the time he was wearing a fawn coloured zip-up jacket and slacks.

Local residents told police that sometime between 10pm and 10.30pm on 29 March, they heard a woman scream three or four times.

Around 11pm, a passer-by discovered Samantha in an unresponsive state amongst the ti-tree in a garden at the rear of a property at 333 Brighton Road in St Kilda, about 2 kilometres from where she was seen at 9:50pm.

She had been severely beaten with an object and suffered a violent sexual assault, before being stripped and left to die in the bushes.  Samantha’s clothes and belongings were never found.

Samantha was taken to hospital but sadly passed away 10 hours later.

Despite a search of the area, the weapon used in Samantha’s fatal assault was not located. 

Samantha’s case was rarely mentioned in cold case media in Victoria but police in the last few years have taken to promoting the case again.

I suspect Samantha got into a vehicle with her client at Blanche Street. It was here she was beaten and sexually assaulted.  She was was then dumped at 333 Brighton Road.

It’s a cold case with not much to go on. I don’t know if there is any DNA.

387,MistressGravity,[],1638798556,"I first heard about this term from a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP3UkprUh-8&amp;t=154s) on the subject. For those who don't know, ""region-locked"" cases are cases that are very widely known in their countries of origin but are virtually unknown outside of them. A couple of them that I've found in my deep dives include:

**1. Maria Bögerl**

Maria Bögerl was the wife of Thomas Bögerl, the head of a Sparkasse (savings bank) in southwestern Germany. On the morning of 12 May 2010, she was kidnapped by person(s) unknown from her family house in Heidenheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. The kidnapper then called Thomas later that day and demanded a ransom of €300,000 (just under $340,000 in 2021) for her release. Thomas complied, and the money was placed in a rucksack and placed under an underpass next to the Autobahn, its location marked with a German flag. The kidnapper(s) never showed up and cut all contacts with both Thomas and the authorities. The Bögerl family (Thomas, his son, and daughter) made a tearful plea for Maria's return in the German crime show ""Aktenzeichen XY"" (whose format was actually the basis for Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted). Unfortunately, Maria's remains were found by a hiker in a wooded area about 10 km north of Heidenheim on 3 June 2010. An autopsy showed that Maria had most likely died the day she was abducted. Thomas committed suicide less than a year later. As of 2020, police have pursued more than 10,000 leads, and although they have DNA evidence, the case is still unsolved.

**2. Emillie Meng**

In the early hours of Sunday, 10 July 2016, 17-year-old Emillie Meng started her walk home from the train station in Korsør, Denmark. She had returned with her friends from a trip to Slagelse, around 20 km northwest of Korsør. She never made it home. A massive search was launched to find her, to no avail. It wasn't until Christmas Eve that her remains were found by a cadaver dog in Regnemarks Bakke, more than 50 km northwest from where she was last seen. A man was arrested during the initial search but was let go after a search at his house produced no evidence linking him to Emillie's abduction and murder. One prominent suspect that is currently being investigated is Peter Madsen, aka the Submarine Killer.

**3. McDonald's Boys**
Toh Hong Huat and Keh Chin Ann were two 12-year-old boys who vanished without a trace from their school in Singapore on 14 May 1986. Hong Huat was last seen as he left for school, while Chin Ann was last seen at around 12:30 pm during the school break. A search was immediately launched to find the boys. Thousands of missing person posters were spread around the island city-state. McDonald's offered a reward of SGD 100,000 (just over $73,000 in 2021) for any information leading to the discovery of the boys, leading to the name of the case. Despite the large reward and the intense search effort, neither one of the boys have ever been found, and they have been declared legally dead in the years after. Theories ranged from the boys running away, being taken by Hong Huat's estranged father, to them being trafficked to Thailand and forced to beg on the streets, with their limbs cut off.

388,janiceian1983,[],1638797776,"# December 11th, 2008

Rosemont, Montreal, Qc, Canada

&amp;#x200B;

Catherine Daviau was a 26 years old woman living alone in her apartment  at ***5165 5th Avenue*** in the Rosemont neighbourhood of Montreal. On the evening of December 11th, she came home from work at around 6 pm and was seen entering her apartment by neighbours around that time. She also talked to a friend on her cellphone at around that time, which shows that Catherine had originally safely reached her home.

However, about only an hour later at around 7:07 PM, a neighbour would call 911 to report a fire at her apartment. 

When the firefighters arrived at the location, they found that the doors were locked and there wasn't any sign of someone breaking into the apartment. They busted the door down and that's when they found Catherine's body on her bed.

Catherine was nude, had visible marks of violence and had been tied up. Her agressor had beaten her up and raped her before setting her room on fire and leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Evidence

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbour's quick call to 911 had resulted in a decent amount of evidence being preserved. The evidence collected by investigators informed them of a few facts.

1- Catherine's attacker had planned ahead. he had brought tie-wraps and bags with him to restrain Catherine. Which shows that the whole thing was planned and not a random act of violence.

2- The attacker was a smoker and smoked Players filter cigarettes, since a few botched up cigarettes had been left behind and Catherine herself was not a smoker.

3- Setting the place on fire however might have been a last minute decision since the ""accelerant"" used to light the fire was a bottle of Catherine's perfume.

DNA was collected at the crime scene but no match was found in any database. 

&amp;#x200B;

# The investigation

&amp;#x200B;

The investigators deduce that Catherine's killer might have stalked her for a while before the attack and learned of her usual schedule because of the very short time frame between her arrival home and the time by which the fire had been discovered by the neighbour. Which means the time between her arrival home and being attacked was even shorter.

While police wouldn't officially state the exact cause of death, the publicly available coroner report shows that the cause of death was from being repeatedly stabbed in the throat and stomach.

Catherine's family find it hard to understand that nobody would have heard her being attacked considering the type of building she lived in (a typical Rosemont triplex surrounded by entire blocks of similar buildings), circumstances that can remind a lot of people about the Diane Bélanger case of 1982 where a young woman had been apparently abducted from her bedroom without anybody in the apartment or adjacent units noticing.

Unfortunately, the case has gone cold since 2008, with no matches being made in any known DNA database. The investigators are considering eventually turning to DNA genealogy testing to revive the case but haven't done so yet.

DNA phenotyping has been done but the police are hesitant to release the information to the public since all it would give is a very generic idea of what the suspect could look like and wouldn't give the age or any specific bodily detail that would make the suspect recognizable. They're also afraid that it might lead to a ton of false leads.

12 year old Rhianna Barreau disappeared from her home in Wakefield Avenue, Morphett Vale, South Australia on October 7, 1992.

Rhianna shared the home with her mother Paula and brother Shannon. Although Rhianna's parents were no longer together, she remained close to both of them. 
Rhianna's dad Leon, was living on the Gold Coast, Queensland, at the time with his wife Sandra. It was the summer school holidays and while Rhianna usually spent her break with her dad up north, this time she had chosen to stay home with her mum. Her brother Shannon was away on school camp. 

That morning at approximately 8.30am, her mother Paula was about to leave the family home and go to work. 

Rhianna was planning to catch the bus to meet her mother that day at the Colonnades shopping centre, which was approximately 6 kilometres from her home to buy a Christmas card for her American pen pal. 

Paula had heard on the radio that there was going to be a bus strike that day, and went into Rhianna's room to discuss the change of plans. She entered her  bedroom where Rhianna was listening to music. Paula suggested that because of the bus strike maybe she could walk to the Reynella shopping centre instead. This shopping centre was only approximately 1.5 kilometres and around a 20 minute walk away from her house. Paula then gave her daughter a kiss goodbye, and unfortunately this was the last time she ever saw her. 

It is thought that Rhianna remained at her home until approximately 10.30am, when she was seen leaving walking in the directions of the shops. Sources claim that Rhianna bought the card for her pen pal from the news agents at 11.19am.

Rhianna was then sighted again between 12.05pm and 12.30pm walking through the grounds of Morphett Vale High School, carrying a small bag thought that contained the card. Some sources claim this was the last sighting of Rhianna, though I also read a number of articles that stated there was another sighting of her at 4.00pm standing alone at the junction of David Terrace and Acre Avenue which is approximately a 6 minute walk from her home on Wakefield avenue. 

At approximately 4.10pm Paula Barreau returned to her family home to find the door locked. When she entered the house she was met with a record lying on the floor, and the tv still on. On the dinning room table was a card that Rhianna had bought for her pen pal, still there in its plastic wrapper. While Rhianna's personal belongings where still in the house, there was no sign of her daughter. 

Paula searched inside and outside, and knocked on the door of her neighbours houses but there was no sign of Rhianna. Although Paula had hope that maybe she accidently overstayed at a friend's house, she knew deep down this was unlikely. And by 6pm the police where contacted. 

Two days later Mr Allen Arthur was called in to lead the investigation.

""From the time I went through the preliminary statements gathered by the two detectives from Major Crime and read all the additional information that was being gathered, I knew something was wrong, I knew she was in trouble,"" he said.

""At the time we established that she'd been seen at the shopping centre … that she was seen walking through the Morphett Vale school and we can only assume that she was on her way home with the cards from the shop. After that there is very, very little.""

Since this day there have been some potential leads, that have been released to the public but unfortunately haven't lead to an arrest. Many people mention a white 2 door Holden Torana with Victorian licence plates that had been seen circling the area days before Rhianna disappeared. 

One neighbour of Rhianna's has stated that her husband saw a white torana, parked in the street on and off in the days prior to the abduction, but he hasn't seen it since. 

Police thought they had a breakthrough and went public with a sighting of the white Torana, however the sightings of the Torana led police nowhere.

Several women have reported to being followed by the same 2 door torana in that area. Police have asked for the driver of this torana to come forward for many many years, but at this point nobody ever has. 

""I have some doubts whether it was a white Torana and with Victorian number plates, only because we hadn't found it and we spent a lot of time looking at white Toranas,"" Mr Arthur said.

Another neighbour of Rhianna's also reported hearing a young girl screaming on the afternoon of the disappearance, but was unknown if this was related to the case. Searches for Rhianna at the time where widespread and thorough, and unfortunately nothing has been found to lead to any arrest. Police believe due to Rhianna's age and lack of contact from her for nearly 30 years they can assume Rhianna is no longer alive. They believe she was likely murdered not long after she was abducted. 

Police are offering immunity and a $1 million dollar reward for information and leads to the arrest of the disaperance or murder of Rhianna.

391,Due-Faithlessness,[],1638749959,"This case is incredibly mysterious, with almost no details available from most sources. Branton's family has apparently made few efforts to publicize his disappearance. However, one person has put significant effort into compiling information about Branton - a high school classmate of his.

Branton was born on July 17, 1960. His father was a pediatrician, and his family was socially prominent. He graduated from Allen High School in Allentown, PA. Allentown is  a small city located in eastern PA, about an hour's drive from Philadelphia. In high school he was a good student who was involved in many extracurricular activities, including serving as class president and competing in swimming and golf. Branton's high school classmate remembers him as possessed of a biting, sarcastic wit. He also recalls that Branton frequently expressed homophobic attitudes towards men he perceived to be gay. 

Branton graduated from Lehigh University with a Bachelor's in American Studies, and attended law school at Temple University. He appears to have been admitted to the bar around 1986, when he was 26 years old. Few details are available regarding Branton's life between 1986 and his disappearance in 1993. Branton worked as a lawyer, and at the time of his disappearance worked at a law practice at 921 Hamilton St in Allentown. Sources are unclear as to which type of law he practiced, or whether the practice was a group or solo practice.

In 1985, when he was 25, Branton was the victim of a mugging and abduction at knifepoint. The perpetrators, brothers named Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, forced Branton to withdraw $175 in cash from an ATM and then drive them to a house where they purchase drugs.

Branton was quoted in a 1990 article as the Special Projects Coordinator for the Lehigh Valley Red Cross AIDS Service Center, saying that he'd surveyed volunteers with the program and found that they primarily chose to volunteer because it made them feel good. ""You're doing the right thing,"" he told the volunteers. ""Your work is really appreciated.""

Branton had a problem with substance abuse. According to his roommate, it wasn't unusual for Branton to disappear for as long as a week, only to reappear. His sister said that his family often didn't hear from him for months.

At the time of his disappearance, Branton was living with a roommate on the 20 block of N 16th St in Allentown.  He was last seen leaving the Allentown Racquetball Club at Sixth and Union Streets in Allentown, Pennsylvania at approximately 11:00 a.m. on January 7, 1993. When his roommate returned to their apartment that evening, he noticed Branton's car parked across the street, instead of in its usual place behind the building. All of Branton's possessions, including his medicine and clothes, were inside the apartment, but there was no sign of him. His roommate waited several days to report him missing, since Branton had disappeared before. 

Branton's family apparently initially believed that he had vanished of his own accord. A news article states, ""Lancaster \[Branton's sister\] was hesitant to discuss her brother's disappearance or the family's experience since then. She said she and her relatives were skeptical that publicity could do little more than rekindle the pain they've tried to overcome.""

At the time of his disappearance, Branton was 5'10"" and 170 lbs with light brown hair. 

Could Branton's disappearance be related to his drug problem? To homophobia? Was his disappearance related to an AIDS infection, perhaps due to cognitive symptoms of the disease? We may never know.

393,AckReik03,[],1638740959,"# The I-70 Killer

The I-70 killer is an unidentified American serial killer who is known to have killed six store clerks in the Midwest in the spring of 1992. His nickname derives from the fact that several of the stores in which his victims worked were located a few miles off of Interstate 70 (I-70).

His victims were usually young, petite, brunette women. One of the victims was a man, but it is believed that he was mistaken for a woman by the killer as he often wore a ponytail. All of the stores attacked were speciality stores and were usually only robbed of a few hundred dollars. He is also suspected of shooting three more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived.

Despite the case being featured on Unsolved Mysteries and Dark Minds, the killer is yet to be identified and investigators have not publicly identified any suspects.

# The Murder of Billy Brossman

On November 30, 2001, at approximately 6:30pm, an unidentified man entered the 7th and 70 Liquor Store located at 2701 Prairieton Road, Terre Haute, Indiana, where he robbed, then shot and killed the store clerk, 31-year-old Billy Brossman, with a 38. caliber handgun, without any known motive, while the whole incident was caught on surveillance camera.

Police describe the suspect as a white man about 5'8 to 6'0, medium build with thinning hair, between 30-40 years old. Several photos of the suspect were recovered from the store video, and have been distributed since the homicide more than 20 years ago.

The shooting occurred just seven blocks from the murder of Michael McCown during the 1992 serial-murder-spree. The investigation received national attention when it was featured on the show America's Most Wanted.

In 2021, multiple sources close to the investigation told News 4 they were closely looking at a convenience store homicide in Terre Haute in 2001, Terre Haute police sergeant Troy Davis confirmed to News 4 there are similarities between the 2001 murder, and the I-70 serial murders.

Davis said investigators have identified a person of interest in the 2001 case. That person is not in custody. Investigators emphasize they are looking at each case separately before drawing any conclusions at this point.

Investigators are cautious to publicly make any connection between the cases at this point. But another police source told News 4 he is confident the person who killed Brossman is definitely a suspect as the I-70 serial killer.

Police have long speculated as to why, after killing six people in one month in 1992, the killer suddenly stopped. If the Brossman case can be connected, then he clearly did not.

The unsolved murder of Billy Brossman in Terre Haute, Indiana."

**The murder of Bernie Williams, Gisborne, Australia, 1984.**

Bernie Williams was executed with two shots from a pistol to the head on March 3, 1984, near Gisborne, Victoria, Australia. He had been walked 20 metres off Hobbs Road, in Bullengarook, into a scrubby patch of bush with his hands tied behind his back. Reports indicated there was evidence he knew what was coming, but I haven’t found a report as to what that evidence is. His body showed no other injuries and so police believe he was killed by a professional hitman. His body was found hunched over by a trail bike rider, five days after he disappeared. 

Williams was the doting father of a three-year-old daughter.  He was married to the girl's mother, but they were separated and remained on good terms.

It may be that Bernie had a premonition something was going to happen to him, telling his mother several weeks before he disappeared that he was “in big trouble”. Asking if she could help he told his mother:  ""No … it's something I have to do for myself.""

Bernie was a champion footballer and well-known around his home town of Melton. Melton at the time was a small country town and football was one of the hubs of social life. The other thing that Bernie had a reputation for was having affairs with various women, some of whom were the wives and girlfriends of other men.

This meant that police had several suspects when Williams' body was discovered murdered in the bush. 

Four days after his disappearance, a phone call to a police station north of Melbourne was received claiming the be Williams and that he was one a “binge” and camped just outside Adelaide, South Australia . He would be back in two weeks. A junior constable initially took the call, hearing the initial STD beeps indicating the call had come from interstate. He then handed the phone to Officer B. Officer B claimed to investigators that it was Bernie Williams on the call as he knew him well. However at the time of the call Bernie Williams was already dead, the state of his body suggesting he had died within hours of going missing.

Based on this sexual jealousy theory, detectives theorised that ""The way he died is consistent with somebody having paid a hit man to do the job,"" Homicide Squad Detective Sergeant Bob Snell told the media in 1985. ""An irate husband would probably want to make sure he suffered before being killed.  Mr Williams had not been touched.  His only injuries were caused by the two shots.""

In June, 1985, a coroner delivered an open finding, saying there appeared to be no motive for killing Williams. Police found Mr Williams had no known enemies or involvement in drugs.

Now, cold-case police are looking again at sexual jealousy as a possible motive. There are several suspects, but one of whom is the now retired Officer B.  It is suspected Williams was having an affair with Office B’s wife and may have even been discovered in the family home.

Williams was a man who made no secret of his sexual exploits, according to evidence given to police by an apprentice plumber who worked with him.

""He would brag to me of his sexual habits with other women and he would tell me the next day what he had done with the girl, and sometimes who it was,"" the apprentice said. ""Some days he would go off leaving me on the work site and he \[came\] back an hour or so later and tell me he'd just screwed some girl”. ""During the time I knew him he told me of dozens of girls he had sex with, after a while I used to get sick of it and didn't listen to him.""

Bernie Williams drove a dark blue Ford LTD, and several locals gave evidence about seeing him in a carpark the night before he was reported missing. The carpark was about halfway between his house and his parent's house, where he had just finished his last meal.

One witness told police about a man he saw talking to Williams in the car park, and how it was unusual the man had greeted Williams as Bernard, not Bernie. ""I know Bernie Williams by sight and I have seen him round town,"" he said. ""I am familiar with his car, the LTD. I knew it was Bernie's car as soon as I saw it.""

There is not much more information online about the murder of Bernie Williams and it doesn’t rate much mention when cold cases are raised in Victoria.

When Gloria's blood was removed there were beige or tan particles/crystals/flakes in her blood. One of the staff members who was infected, Dr. Gorchynski, also had the same particles in her blood when she was examined at another hospital. Her symptoms included trouble breathing, double vision, full body tremors that were notably painful. Another nurse claimed to experience having trouble with her hearing and aphasia. I forget her name, but I don't think it's known if the same thing was found in her blood. The blood samples revealed that there was a reduced amount of cholinesterase in the blood. That is something that happens when someone is exposed to pesticides. If you look at the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning, it does kinda line up with the symptoms presented. But not 100%. The things that stood out to me were the double vision explained by Doctor Gorchynski, and the other nurse's symptoms. Everybody's different and does react to things in their own way tho, so having some uncommon side effects isn't too crazy of a theory. So, let me wrap this up. My theory is that Gloria had been exposed to Parathion methyl, also known as O,O-Dimethyl O-4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate. Either that or somehow a chemical reaction in her body was quite literally producing it or something very similar to it. Parathion methyl can cause heart problems, kidney failure, and SWEAT. When exposed to your skin, Parathion methyl can sleep through into your blood stream. She could have been all sweaty and covered in pesticides, causing a garlicy, smell. The renal failure could cause the ammonia smell. I'm not sure how long the chemical is traceable. They could have very well not detected anything after the toxic exposure happened if it had a short halflife. Also, there could have been a huge cover up as to how she got poisoned in the first place, so they tried to make people believe it was mass hysteria, and when that wasnt accepted, they had to make up this crazy DMSO to Dimethyl sulfate. I do believe that the hospital may have had a gas leak of Parathion, or Gloria got exposed to so much that it was toxic to everyone around her. Parathion Methyl would be become a banned substance just 3 years and 11 months after the tragic events that occured the day that Gloria Ramirez died. I even think she may have attempted suicide after finding out she had cancer 6 months prior to her death.

397,TaraCalicosBike,[],1638638240,"Hello all! I wanted to discuss my/our thoughts on the trial transcript of Lizzie Borden, at the trial of the murders of her father &amp; step mother. 

[Wikipedia on Case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Borden)


I’ve had my own opinions on this case, and after reading the trial transcript, they’ve begun to shift.

[Trial Transcript of Lizzie’s Testimony](https://famous-trials.com/lizzieborden/1444-inquest)

Now, I get the witnesses can be unreliable, or get their statements twisted… but Lizzie seems to be doing a lot of misstepping, backtracking, and holds a lot of confusion around her own statements. 

For example, she claims she went to the barn to find lead sinkers for her upcoming fishing trip. She goes on to say that the farm she plans to fish at and holds her equipment already gas lines, rods, and… sinkers. The lawyer proceeds to question her on why she would need a sinker if they’re already there. She seems thrown off by this, and goes on to say that she doesn’t know if sinkers are at the farm, and she wanted to search the barn, upstairs, for them… so she doesn’t need to buy any if she already has them. This seems fair enough. But, her trip isn’t until the following Monday, and she happens to be in the stifling hot barn exactly the time of the murder of her father, on Thursday prior. Does Lizzie need 20 minutes in the barn searching a small box for sinkers? The lawyer is stuck on this point. She claims she spent some of that time eating pears. The lawyer wants to know why are you eating pears when you were too sick for breakfast? She backtracks a lot here, regarding whether she at breakfast. 

She backtracks about her Wednesday evening dinner, and whether she was even there for that. This is important, because if she was, she would have encountered Uncle John Morse. 

Another small but sticky point for me: she stumbles over what she was doing in the kitchen. She claims to be reading Harpers Magazine, waiting for her iron flats to heat. Later, she goes on to say it was Providence Journal. The lawyer notices the misstep, and questions which she was reading. She more or less then says both. 


But for me, this is the most important part: when asked where she was when Bridget answers the door to her father, she first claims she was at the top of the stairs. This correlates with Bridget saying she heard a small giggle, at the top of the stairs, from Lizzie. Slightly later on, Lizzie claims she wasn’t at the top of the stairs at all, but elsewhere in the house. Why does Lizzie have so many different versions of her activities that morning? 


Questions: 

1. The family was all very sick, the maid included. Lizzie was seen at the pharmacy asking to buy Prussic acid the day before. Was Lizzie’s initial plan to poison the family? Did she manage to find something to put into the food, making the family sick, and then faked her own illness? 

2. What took 20 minutes in the barn? The lawyer is right that it should have only taken a few minutes, and her eating the pears seems like an after thought answer to buy time for her being in the barn. 

3. Where was Lizzie when her father came home? It sounds like her first answer is truth,  that she was at the top of the stairs, as Bridget heard a giggle. Why did she backtrack and say she was elsewhere in the house? 

My thoughts: I think Lizzie knew and worked with the killer. They were both in on it, but she didn’t wield the axe. I also believe the uncle had knowledge. I find it no coincidence that the murder occurred on his first visit to the family in 5 years. What are your thoughts?

This was a case I recently came upon and found very little coverage here, and given recent developments thought it worthwhile to summarise the key events of the Starved Rock murders of 1960 and recent updates. Whilst Chester Weger was convicted of the crime, accusations of a forced confession, police coercion, contaminated evidence and an alleged deathbed confession have created persistent doubt as to his guilt since. Does Chester Weger have a case to test his innocence? Will new evidence testing yield new leads, or do you think they convicted the right killer?

There’s a fair bit to cover, so in order to manage the length of this piece I have covered only key details, so the below should by no means be considered comprehensive. It’s still turned out quite lengthy, so fair warning.

**Starved Rock State Park**

Starved Rock State Park became the first recreational park owned by the state of Illinois when it was purchased in 1911, but had been developed privately as a destination for vacationers in the late 19th century. Situated on the bank of the Illinois River and famed for its many canyons, visitors can enjoy 13 miles (21km) of hiking trails, with overlook views and waterfalls, as well as recreational fishing, boating and camping. Only ninety miles (150km) south-west of Chicago, Starved Rock remains the most popular state park in Illinois.

**Three friends take a trip**

Lillian Oetting, 50, Frances Murphy, 47, and Mildred Linquist, 50 all resided in the Riverside neighbourhood of Chicago. Wives of prominent businessmen, they planned a four day getaway to Starved Rock State Park and set off on Monday, 14 March 1960. After checking in to the Starved Rock Lodge, they ate lunch before heading out for a hike to St Louis Canyon, an approximately 2 mile (3km) return track with views to a spring-fed waterfall. They took Frances Murphy’s camera and set off through the snowy landscape. 

Oetting’s husband George was expecting to hear from his wife that evening – when he received no call from her, he rang the hotel. Staff told him she wasn’t available, and suggested she might call the next morning. Unconcerned, George wondered if perhaps they had gone out for the evening. He called again the next morning, and was told the three women had been at breakfast together that morning, and must have gone out. George was reassured by this, even though the sighting would prove to be mistaken.

A late winter storm hit the area later that night, with near-blizzard conditions blanketing the area with several inches of snow.

On Wednesday morning, George Oetting called the lodge again, and when he could not reach his wife for the third time, insisted staff check on their room. They discovered the beds unslept in and their bags still packed. The station wagon belonging to Murphy remained parked outside the lodge. The women had been unaccounted for at this point by almost 40 hours. Alarmed, George phoned his friend, Virgil W. Peterson, operating director of the Chicago Crime Commission. Word of the missing friends soon reached the LaSalle County Sherriff’s office, who prepared to begin the search. 

**The Discovery in St Louis Canyon**

The bodies of the three women were soon found by several boys, recruited to the search from a nearby state correctional camp. Found on their backs under a small rock ledge, two of the women were naked from the waist down, while the third was found still wearing a girdle. Two of them were bound together with white string, and all had been viciously beaten around the head. In clearing the recently fallen snow, the site was disturbed by investigators and potential evidence may have been destroyed.

Nearby they found Murphy’s camera, case smeared with blood and the strap broken; a pair of bloodied binoculars and a frozen tree limb, also covered in blood. They determined the branch was likely the murder weapon, and after studying the scene, considered it likely that the murder had taken place deeper in the canyon, and then the bodies dragged under the ledge. 

Autopsies concluded that the women had been killed shortly after lunching at the lodge, but were unable to determine if sexual assaults had taken place. Robbery was considered an unlikely motive as the women had left their valuables behind in the hotel room. Initial theories held that more than one attacker was likely involved as it would have been very difficult for a single person to overpower and control three able women.

**Few leads and mounting pressures**

With little evidence to go on, the investigation failed to make headway for months following the murders. Matters were further complicated by jurisdictional tensions between the state’s attorney and the state police; state investigators suggested that Chicago mobsters had committed the murders in an act of retribution against Crime Commissioner Virgil Peterson, a close family friend of all three women. State attorney Harland Warren doubted that gangsters would travel 100 miles to commit such a murder and not bring a weapon with them. 

Pressure from the press to solve the crime was constant and investigation costs mounted. A small gold ring belonging to Oetting which was thought missing sparked hopes of a new lead, but instead caused more scandal when it was found – overlooked inside her bloody glove.

Against these increasing pressures, Warren Harland decided to spend his own money to purchase a microscope and take a closer look at the two kinds of twine which had been wrapped around two of the victims. This led him to match both kinds of twine to that found in the Starved Rock Lodge’s kitchen, where it was used for wrapping food. All the lodge workers had already been subjected to questioning (via polygraph, an unreliable method), but Warren ordered them to be questioned again.

This is when Chester Weger came under suspicion.

**Finally, a suspect**

Chester Weger was a 21-year-old man with a wife and two young children. At the time of the murders, he was working in the Lodge’s kitchen. Weger’s failure of the subsequent polygraph test brought him under suspicion. Weger co-operated with investigators, surrendering a buckskin jacket with suspicious dark stains. Testing confirms the stain is blood, although sources differ as to whether it is confirmed to be human. By September, investigators had begun constant surveillance of Weger and attempt to connect him to a robbery and sexual assault which occurred two months before the Starved Rock murders in a nearby park, where the assailant bound the female teenage victim with twine.

After failing another series of polygraph tests, and with the victim of the earlier assault identifying Weger’s photograph as that of her attacker, Weger is arrested. He is questioned about the 1959 assault, in an interrogation that lasts beyond midnight. Weger confessed to the murders, saying he attempted to rob the women and killed them when they fought back.

Weger signed a confession typed up for him and led a re-enactment of the crime for police and reporters at St Louis Canyon. Following his first meeting with attorneys however, Weger retracted his confession, stating investigators threatened him with a gun and told him they would send him to the electric chair.

Weger maintained this retraction throughout his trial and conviction for one of the murders, that of Lillian Oetting. Prosecutors sought conviction for only one of the murders so that further trials could be pursued if a conviction was not secured for Oetting’s murder. Weger received a life sentence on March 4, 1961, despite the death penalty initially being sought.

**Doubts cast on conviction**

 Chester Weger maintained his innocence throughout his incarceration. In a letter to the Chicago Tribune on April 20, 1963, Weger wrote, “Now there’s nothing in the world that I needed bad enough to kill for.” He refused on multiple occasions to admit guilt to secure release at parole reviews.

There appears to be no physical evidence linking Chester to the crime scene and no witnesses place him at the scene of the crime. There is however physical evidence which suggests Weger could be innocent. Blonde and black hairs found on the victims, including on the finger of Frances Murphy’s glove and in the palm of Lillian Oetting, were found to be dissimilar to Weger’s hair. No hair or fibre evidence was presented at trial, despite numerous samples being collected at the scene. The presence of both black and blonde hairs on the victims strongly suggest the presence of two killers, in line with the investigators’ own initial assessment. 

Weger claimed that his initial motive for the attack was robbery, however all the victims still had their jewellery on them when found. Decades after the conviction, a juror admitted to the Chicago Tribune in 2016 that she found Weger’s confession “implausible” at the time. Weger’s current attorneys, Andy Hale and Celeste Stack, argue that a case such as this would have never made it to trial under today’s standards.

An alleged deathbed confession surfaced in 2006, in an affidavit signed by Chicago Sergeant Mark Gibson. Included in a motion to support new DNA testing, Gibson states that around 1982, he visited a woman in hospital to help her “clear her conscience.” The woman told the officer “things got out of hand” at a State Park and “they dragged the bodies.” Gibson reported that this confession was cut short by the woman’s daughter, who said her mother was not of sound mind. The affidavit did not name the woman, nor did it address whether there had been any follow-up after the initial reporting of the incident. 

The DNA testing was granted, allowing hairs found at the scene and the buckskin jacket to be tested, but failed to provide any new information as the samples were corrupted.

**Parole after almost 60 years**

Weger was denied parole 23 times over the course of his sentence. He was finally granted parole on November 21, 2019, but his release was delayed until February 21, 2020 under review against the state's Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act. At the time of his release, he was the longest-serving inmate in Illinois’ prisons.

**October 2021: A new chance to test evidence**

On October 26, 2021, new permission was granted to test evidence using contemporary techniques. This includes cigarette butts, hairs and string found at the crime scene. LaSalle County prosecutors  opposed the testing, claiming the evidence has been improperly stored, and even handled by students on field trips. It remains to be seen if this testing provides any further information, or if contamination interferes as it did in the 2006 tests.

A forthcoming HBO documentary *The Murders at Starved Rock* could be interesting viewing, as it follows investigation into Weger’s conviction by the son of the lead prosecutor in the original trial.

As I mentioned, the above is just a summary of events related to this case, but I recommend reading further in to the details of the investigation if interested as I couldn’t cover everything here. Troy Taylor’s account, available via Google books and linked below, is a great place to start.

Lucy was asleep on her living room sofa when Parle shot her and then poured petrol around the house and set it alight. The target for the murder was Lucy's boyfriend but as he was not home, Parle killed Lucy instead. 

After being arrested for Lucy's murder and questioned, Parle was released on bail but absconded and is yet to be re-arrested.

It is believed Parle could be in Europe but there have been reports of him being seen in the [Canary Islands](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/double-murder-fugitive-confronted-british-18308304), [Dubai, Thailand](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/double-murder-fugitive-kevin-parle-17995594) and [mainland Europe](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/suspect-killer-most-wanted-list-20841924.amp).

But where is he??? 

Is a criminal underworld hiding him? Offering him freedom in return for utilising his size, sterength and intimidating appearance?

Is he hiding away and keeping to himself?

Or, as the police and NCA suspect, is he indeed deceased himself?

Greetings everyone!

I am here to provide a follow up to a post I did on this subreddit nearly 8 years ago about my mother. You can find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2r37i8/the_disappearance_of_my_mother_deborah_sykes/). 

Reddit loves updates so I am here to hopefully provide some insight. (I asked the mods about making this post a few months ago and was give the go ahead). 

Anyway, what sort of stuff can happen on a case like this over 8 years? Glad you asked! Basically, the case was picked up by a detective working at the department and she has worked on it while she could over the last few years. I can't provide all the details of what she's done but she put forth a valiant effort in attempt to close the book on this case. 

As of early 2021, my step dad, Del, died in his home (wasn't COVID). Any truth he had died with him, and despite all the effort, he never gave any useful information. 

As of May 2021, my grandfather has also passed (also not COVID), which pretty much wraps up this case and any hope that it would be solved unfortunately. 

The detective working the case questioned many people, and even met with Del a few times in hopes to get some information on what happened. They had a formal questioning with him about the case, but he did not confess or provide any information (side note from my original post is he did admit to killing the family dog). 

After Del passed, his belongings were searched and there was nothing that provided any insight to the case.  

I've done a couple podcasts over the years which I'll link below:

In the end, my mother has been missing for almost 17 years (damn) and I personally feel by now we'll never know the truth. If she was in hiding I had hoped the passing of her father, and the passing of Del might pull her out, but I guess not. 

Alright, sorry this post is lacking anything super interesting but I am more than happy to answer any questions I can. Obviously a lot more has happened in the 8 years it's just difficult to remember and summarize it all here.

In 1999, Brittney Simpson and her siblings would awake to what is still an unbelievable nightmare til this day: their doting mother Kitty Wyanette Simpson had not returned home since the evening before.

On the evening of February 15th, 1999, Kitty Simpson, a 27 year old mother described by most as a fashionista, went for a night out at Cool Daddy’s Bar in Oklahoma City, OK. She left her purse with a friend at the bar and left with an unknown male in his vehicle to a local motel. She has never been seen again.

In February 2021, Brittney Simpson took to Facebook for more information on her mother’s disappearance. In a saddening post, she revealed their family indeed believes their beloved mother was murdered. 22 years later their family still yearns for an answer. 

Kitty is described as being Native American, standing 4’11, 135lbs with brown hair and hazel eyes. She has two tribal tattoos (possibly blue or purple in color) on her right ankle and in 1999 her tongue was pierced. She was last seen wearing a white shirt, jeans (possibly by Levi), black boots or sneakers, and lots of tribal rings and bracelet.

The description on the author's site mentions that it was loosely based on a real crime, but the author, keeps very tight-lipped about the killer's identity... so, naturally, I started looking for it.

TOWSON, Md. (WJZ) — Forty years after the murder of a Halethorpe teen, Baltimore County police have identified her killer.
The police department said Wednesday that cold case detectives have determined John Anthony Petrecca, Jr., who died in 2000, was responsible for the 1981 murder of 13-year-old Heather Porter.
“As a result of advances in forensic technology, Heather Porter’s family members now know the identity of the person who took their loved ones life,” the agency said. “The Baltimore County Police Department would like to thank Bode Technology, the Hackerman Foundation

and the FBI for their expert analysis, assistance and support in solving this cold case.”
Porter’s body was found in the woods near Ridgewood Road and Goucher Boulevard in Towson on Sept. 24, 1981, a day after she went missing from her Halethorpe neighborhood. An autopsy found she had been sexually assaulted and strangled.

Though investigators had some of the suspect’s DNA, the homicide case turned cold and went unsolved for four decades. It wasn’t until last year that detectives gave Porter’s killing a second look.
The suspect’s DNA was sent off lab testing and the results were provided to the FBI.

In February, police zeroed in on Petrecca as a possible suspect. A search of his criminal background found he had multiple rape arrests over the years, and police determined that he lived near the area where Porter was last seen alive.
After getting permission to exhume Petrecca’s remains from a local cemetery, police sent his DNA off for lab testing. The results showed it was a match for Porter’s killer.",40 Years Later: Police Solve Baltimore County Teen's Cold Case Murder

I came across the Jamie Fraley story, and I feel for the family since it's pretty much fallen off the radar. Personally, I feel the bf's dad was involved, he definitely had motive and access, and a track record - although, with the latest breakthrough's in missing persons cases where they find a car in some water (decades later it seems), it's made me re-think a lot of these cases.

Seeing that there were sightings of Jamie in 2015, that turned out to be false, do you think this case is as obvious as it seems, or did she take off in a car with someone unknown?

(see links at bottom for more info / videos)

Intense stomach pain has left a young woman seeking a ride to the hospital for a third time in 24 hours. Her last known phone call at 1:30 am ends abruptly when an unidentified man pulls up to give her a ride. Two months later, with authorities and family desperate - could the answers be connected to the awful smell coming from a hot car trunk?

22 year old Jamie Fraley was described by her mother as sweet and feisty and driven to do good. Jamie had suffered from bipolar and anxiety throughout her life, which had made things like graduating high school or getting a driver’s license difficult. AT the time she was last seen, Jaime was living on social security disability and regularly meeting with a social worker. In the few years leading up to her disappearance the young woman had made huge strides in her life and was now attending a local community college with plans to become a substance abuse counselor – although she had never used drugs her self.

In 2006, Jamie met her fiancé Ricky Simmonds, Jr and the two moved in together at the Copperfield apartment complex in Gastonia. The happy couple wouldn’t be together long though, Simmonds had a criminal record, and in early 2007, he was sentenced to 15 months in state prison for theft. During this period Jamie would keep in regular contact with him.

Although, her fiancé was in prison, his father, Ricky Simmonds, Sr lived in the same apartment complex just two doors away from Jamie. A former felon himself, Ricky Sr – who worked part time as a maintenance guy at the complex – had served 6 years in prison in the 1980s on manslaughter charges related to the strangling of his then girlfriend.

Now in 2008, Ricky Sr’s love life was on the rocks again, he had recently been dumped by his girlfriend, Kim – who had accused him of stalking, but more on that later. With no girlfriend and a son in prison,- Ricky Sr had some time on his hands, some of which he spent helping out Jaime with errands around town.

It is known that Ricky Sr gave Jamie one ride to the hospital on the last day she was seen. Law enforcement has not released any evidence to tie Ricky Sr to Jaime’s disappearance, but he was a person of interest. Some sources have reported that Ricky Sr was obsessed with his son’s fiancé, and given his own criminal history of stalking and sexual predation, may have crossed one too many lines.

Feeling awful, Jamie attempted to get a ride to the hospital for a third time in the early morning of August 8. After a midnight call to her mother, where she refused a ride – Jaime made a call to an unidentified friend at 1:30 am, which she cut short due to her ride showing up – she reportedly referred to the driver of the car as a “he”, but didn’t say who. That was the last time anyone would see Jamie Fraley. She never made it to the hospital for that third visit.

The next day a healthcare provider visited Jamie’s apartment, but she was not home.

Alarmed by hearing she missed an appointment, Fraley’s family went to her apartment. The unit was locked and their daughter was not home. Upon entering there were no signs of a struggle or foul play, with only Jamie’s cell phone gone the apartment still contained her wallet, purse, keys, and ID. The family did report that Jamie had vomited several times in the apartment, and also that the shoe laces from her favorite shoes were gone.

It was then Jamie’s family reported her missing to police.

The first clue in the case arrived 2 days later, when Jamie’s cell phone was found by a utility worker in some overgrown grass by the roadside about 3 miles from her apartment. The phone appeared to have been tossed out the window of a vehicle. Despite this clue, finding the phone didn’t reveal any fingerprints or scents for search dogs to follow.

Soon after Jamie’s fiancé, Ricky Jr, was released from prison, and moved in with Jamie’s family joining them in their search. But it must have made for some awkward father son moments.

Since Jamie’s disappearance, suspicion had immediate fell on to Ricky Sr, as he was the last person to have seen Jamie, and had been interviewed by police. Police became more suspicious of him when he became linked to a bag of trash found on a roadside – prompting them to seek a warrant they were never able to fully serve.

Because - The most bizarre thing about Ricky Sr was yet to happen.

As we mentioned, Ricky Sr had been stalking his ex-girlfriend Kim, who had got a restraining order against him in May of that year. On June 7, two months after Jamie’s disappearance, Kim – who recently had her purse and car keys stolen – noticed a strange odor which appeared to be coming from her car. After a few days, Kim opened the trunk to find the lifeless body of Ricky Sr.

Authorities believe Ricky attempted to ambush his ex by hiding in her trunk. Things didn’t go according to plan, and between the drugs and alcohol found in his system and the intense oven like temperatures the former convicted felon had died from accidental heatstroke – with Kim’s car keys and stolen purse on his body – along with a knife which authorities suspect he planned to use against his ex.

With the death of Ricky Sr the investigation was almost at a standstill. Now a key witness and person of interest was dead, and with him the possible answers about Jamie’s disappearance.

Law enforcement does not believe she left on her own, and since she lacked a license or a vehicle, it would have been nearly impossible for her to do so – so they believe someone else has to be involved.

Although it has been over 10 years, Jamie’s case remains unsolved. Her family’s hope that she may be alive was recharged around 2015 by a tip which suggested Jaimie may be living in Arizona or Nevada and had been seen in an online ad working as an escort. Unfortunately, the lead in question was tracked down, and the woman seen in the ad was not Jaime.

Over the years new clues have dried up, and media coverage has waned – but Gaston County PD revisited the cold case in 2019. Jaimie’s mother is now in a race against time, as she battles her own mortality . As the years go by with no answers, Jaime’s mother remains spiritual and said she is seeking peace and is still hoping for a reunion with her daughter.

Over a decade later this case has scarcely any more clues than it had within the first 48 hours - but Jaime’s mother is convinced someone out there holds the answers – someone out there knows what happened.

407,TheBryanWorters,[],1638475029,"The Jasper County Coroner’s Office, in collaboration with Redgrave Research Forensic Services, will be holding a press conference regarding updates in the case of Jasper County John Doe, who was an unidentified victim of serial killer Larry Eyler.  The press conference will take place at 5:00 PM CST (4:00 PM PST, 6:00 PM EST). A livestream of the conference will be available on both WTHR.com and on WTHR’s FaceBook page.  

**Case Summary**  

On the morning of October 15th, 1983, an individual setting and checking fox traps on private property near the town of Rensselaer in Jasper County, Indiana came across what he believed to be human remains. He immediately contacted Jasper County authorities, with responding officer Paul Ricker being the first on the scene. Ricker and his colleagues observed partial skeletal remains strewn about the property, with many of the pieces fragmented. After the bone fragments were gathered, they were sent to Jasper County’s (then) coroner, Dr. Stephen Spicer. In collaboration with Dr. John Pless of the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis, the two would deduce much from the sum of thirty bone fragments recovered.

The victim was estimated to be a white male, approximately 18 to 26 years of age, had shoulder-length reddish-brown hair, stood at an estimated 5’6” (168 cm) to 5’8” (172 cm), and was believed to have previously fractured his left femur. Stainless steel tooth caps were noted at teeth #19 and #30, along with amalgam restorations at #2, #3, and #12. Anthropologist consultation suggests that one of the restored teeth was applied backward. Several articles of clothing were also discovered at the scene, including a gray hooded sweatshirt, a pair of Levi brand jeans and a brown belt in a size 28”, gray/burgundy socks, and suede athletic shoes in a size 11 ½. Additionally, a zippo lighter with the name ‘ARLENE’ engraved onto it was found near the remains. Officials determined that the young man was the victim of a homicide and estimated that he had been deceased for approximately one to two years prior to his discovery. Despite the numerous identifying characteristics, no missing person reports in the area fit the man’s description, nor did anyone claim to know the identity of John Doe.  

Not long after this discovery, authorities linked the remains to a rash of murders in Indiana and Illinois, with many of the victims speculated to be hitchhikers, sex workers, and/or were members of the LGBTQ+ community. The murder series ended with the arrest of Larry Eyler, who was later convicted of two counts of homicide and sentenced to death. But before Eyler’s execution date was slated to happen, he died from AIDS-related complications on March 6th, 1994. Two days after his death, his attorney, Kathleen Zellner, held a press conference which disclosed that Eyler had confessed to a further 19 murder victims, including the unidentified young man found in Jasper County over a decade earlier.

Eyler recalled picking up a hitchhiker — a young man possibly in his early 20s — along Highway 41 on or around the weekend of November 20th, 1982. He believed that his encounter took place somewhere near Vincennes, Indiana. Eyler murdered the young man and dumped his body in the field near Rensselaer, where the fox trapper found his body just over one year later.   

To assist in the search for John Doe’s identity, Anthony Redgrave has rendered a new forensic image of him based on photos of the skull, the description that Eyler had provided, and in consultation with anthropologist Dr. Samantha Blatt of Idaho State University. Redgrave Research would like to thank DNA Solutions for DNA extraction, HudsonAlpha Discovery for the whole-genome sequencing, and Kevin Lord of Saber Investigations for bioinformatics. We would also like to thank investigators Andy and Diana Boersma of the Jasper County Coroner’s Office; Kathleen Zellner; everyone who has been involved in Ellis’s case since his discovery; and those who have continued to spend their time, effort, and dedication to honoring a young man who they never personally knew.

A passerby strolling the alleys of New York City would come across a deceased body that had clearly been strangled. Later it is identified as an African American woman.

Meanwhile, in Pleasantville, NJ, a father and his two daughters lie waiting for their mom and wife. Last seen leaving her home on Pleasant Ave for work, Viola A. Butler never comes home. Her family immediately files a missing persons report. 

It is determined that Viola made it to her workplace via cab, parked her car in Atlantic City Expressway, and waited for the shuttle to take her to the entrance of the Bally’s Park Place Casino where she worked  the midnight to 8am shift as a parking attendant. A witness came forward at that time stating that she seen Viola get into a mid-sized red sports car with tinted windows. She never boarded the shuttle to work. 

In 2000, Viola’s house was foreclosed and purchased by a development company. Before demolishing, K-9s checked the property for remains to no avail. In 2019, a group nicknamed the WebSluethers would post Viola’s case on their blog, where coincidentally one of her daughters was internet searching her mother’s name and stumbled across the blog and commented her heartbreaking attestation that law enforcement had “lost her mother’s case”.  Later, a  “WebSluether” from the blog would make the connection between missing person Viola and NYC Jane Done UP9629. Several members from the blog would then make efforts to contact Viola’s daughter so that she could contact law enforcement to confirm the NYC Jane Doe and Viola were one in the same.

Just months after web surfing for any existence of her mother, Viola’s daughter received confirmation that NYC Jane Doe was indeed her mother. Posting confirmation for “Websluethers” and thanking them for their assistance. While a mother has finally been laid to rest, the circumstances surrounding her disappearance and death are still needing answers. How did she get to NY and whom did she leave with? These are questions Viola’s two daughters ponder.

417,gaycatdetective,[],1638427124,"Background and Identification: 

Rebecca Boyd was 29 years old with two young children when she disappeared in 2002. Her estranged husband reported her missing on July 30, 2002. She had last been seen near Lawton, Oklahoma on July 26, 2002. Rebecca, a resident of Muskogee, was not from the area, but was known to visit family in the area.

On July 13, 2005, a farmer discovered a human skull in his field. No other remains were recovered, and a cause of death could not be determined. The site where the skull was discovered was just a quarter mile away from where a victim of a serial killer operating in the area had been discovered two years earlier. In September 2021, University of North Texas discovered a match when Rebecca's DNA profile was uploaded. Now the OSBI is hoping her identification could lead to her killer. Her son Todd, who was 9 when she disappeared,  fears he may never receive answers.

Although Rebecca was reported relatively quickly after her disappearance, I could find only one search result about her case from before she was identified. A Facebook page titled Oklahoma Cold Case made a post about her on March 7, 2020 which provided a few details about her appearance, but there was not much information available otherwise. Rebecca had four tattoos, but this would ultimately prove unhelpful in her identification since it was three years before remains were recovered, and it was not a full recovery. 

Theories:

I would be very interested to know who Rebecca was visiting, how frequently she visited, if anyone traveled with her, and what the arrangements were like. Did she ever take her children with her? Did she always go alone or travel with a friend? How did she get there? Did she stay at someone's house or in a hotel/motel? Unfortunately there is just not a lot to go on here.

There was a serial killer operating in the Lawton area between 1999 and 2003. (I will not go into much detail about that on this post, but will link to a thorough write up from this sub down below.) Though 5 of the 6 victims were known sex workers in the Cache Road area, we do not know enough about Rebecca to know if she may have been a sex worker or not. No news articles about her identification mention her as a possible victim of the Lawton serial killer except to say her body was discovered very close to where one of the victims had been dumped (likely Pamela Woodring). However, the OSBI made comments that alluded to this being a homicide investigation despite the cause of death being unknown. (4 of the other victims' cause of death could also not be determined, and the remaining 2 were initially classified as overdoses.)

The timeline and geographical location of where she was discovered fits well with the Lawton serial killer, but the other victims were discovered in or near water. And a major difference is that in this case, only a skull was recovered. It is unknown if she was doing sex work in the area but I don't think it matters. If she was from out of town and was staying in a motel along Cache Road, the killer could have mistaken her for one just for being in an area known for sex work. Or maybe he was not specifically targeting sex workers, just vulnerable young women in the area. 

Do you think she could have been a victim of the Lawton serial killer? If not, what are your theories?

Regardless, I am glad Rebecca has been identified and reunited with her family. I hope this does lead them one step closer to answers, and possibly answers for the other women's families as well.

418,unsolvedbb1,[],1638424945,"I mentioned this case in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/r54hqt/when_researching_missing_persons_cases_do_you/) I started. Just a few days ago, the Doe Network updated her case file with some new information.

On Friday, June 10, 1983, 25-year-old single mother Graciela ""Grace"" Esquivel dropped her six-year-old daughter Angie off with her (Grace's) parents for an overnight visit. She said she was going out with friends. When her parents Armando and Manuela went to drop Angie off the next day, they discovered a chilling scene.

Their daughter's driver's license and wallet (I've read no mention of her car or keys also being present, so I'm going to assume they were both gone) were in the house and her bed had been neatly turned down as if she were ready to go to sleep. Everything was there...except for Grace. She has never been seen again and there has been no activity on her social security number since 1983.

On November 29, 2021, The Doe Network updated Grace's case file to include a piece of info which may or may not be relevant. A few weeks before her mysterious disappearance, Grace called her sister who lived in Texas and asked if she could stay with her for a few weeks; the sister declined her request. 

There is admittedly very little info about this case which appears to have gotten no coverage locally even at the time. In the thread I linked to earlier, I mentioned that cases such as this with such short summaries and no real media coverage often lead me (and I'm sure other people who like researching cold cases) to really question the few nuggets of information contained in said summaries. Here are some of the questions and observations I made re: Grace Esquivel:

&amp;#x200B;

* Was it ever confirmed that Grace actually went out with friends that night? The reason I question this because if you read the wording of the Charley Project page (which hasn't been updated), it says that she asked her parents to watch her daughter ""because Esquivel ***said*** she was going out with friends"" (emphasis mine). Indeed, [the original Doe Network write-up](https://web.archive.org/web/20180929094347/http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/111dfia.html) also uses that phrasing, although the updated version simply says she went out with friends. I'm going to assume she most likely did and that said friends were questioned.

&amp;#x200B;

* I mentioned in the aforementioned thread that Grace's keys and car were intact. This appears to be an error on my part as I have been unable to find any description of the case that mentions either one being present. So that begs the question — was Grace's car and/or keys found at the house?  If not, then it would appear that she decided to go back out or was forced to do so by an unknown party after arriving home from her night out. If the car was never found, it could be that she simply had an accident and crashed into a body of water. A tragic but not uncommon scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

* If Grace was abducted from her home, I have a feeling that it was by someone she knew and trusted based on the fact that there were apparently no signs of a struggle. Could it have been one of the friends she was with that night? Or perhaps another friend or partner that her family and social group weren't familiar with?

&amp;#x200B;

* When did Grace's parents first realize she was missing? I ask this because I could swear that I read a summary of the case which said that Grace planned to go to her parents' house herself the next day to pick up Angie. If that was the original plan, had they tried calling her and got no answer, which prompted them to take Angie home themselves? And what time of day did they bring her home? If it was later in the day, then we may have no real way of knowing exactly when Grace went missing.

&amp;#x200B;

* Without more context on the phone call to her sister, I can't say whether it's related to Grace's disappearance or not. The piece of info seems kind of random and almost added as an afterthought to the case summary. It literally just says that she asked her sister in Texas if she could stay with her for awhile and that the sister said no. And? Was Grace frantic about staying in Texas? Did she indicate that she feared someone or something in Iowa? Did she name any names?

419,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1638404258,"On the afternoon of May 18, 1969, 10-year-old Cynthia Warrick left her New Haven, Indiana home to go out and play. It was 3:30pm and Cynthia planned to walk to the local drugstore, a popular place in town where kids went to browse the comic books, buy candy, and use the pay phone to call friends. When she failed to return home on time later that evening, Cynthia’s parents, Ruth and Billie Warrick, assumed Cynthia was at a friends house. However as the night wore on, and Cynthia failed to make contact, her parents grew more concerned. Shortly before 11pm Ruth and Billie reported their daughter missing. 

Cynthia was the youngest of the Warrick’s three children, and their only daughter. She was a fourth grade student at Sunnymede Elementary School and was in the special education class, however by all accounts she was a very bright, lively, and independent student who never let her disability stop her from doing what everyone else did. 

Cynthia was also known as quite the “tomboy.” According to her teachers, she preferred pants over dresses, didn’t like her hair to be brushed or styled, and could always be found challenging, and mostly beating, the boys on the playground at races or other “playground competitions.” She was also known to be somewhat of a “daredevil.” Less than a week prior, Cynthia had leapt from a swing at a neighbors house, resulting in a broken wrist and a trip to the hospital where her arm was wrapped in a white plaster cast.  

When police arrived at the Warrick’s home, located at 177 Sturm Street, they took the report from her parents and the search for Cynthia began. It was learned Cynthia *had* made it to the drugstore, her intended destination. The clerk immediately recognized a picture of Cynthia, as she had been to the store countless times in the past. He informed police that he had seen Cynthia earlier that day. According to him, she had used the pay phone, browsed the candy and comics, and then exited the store. 

A second witness recalled seeing Cynthia walking nearby a short time later past a place called “Pal’s,” a truck stop where Cynthia’s parents worked during the week, located near the junction of highways US 30 and US 24. A third and final witness claimed to see Cynthia walking through the parking lot of “King’s,” a department store located just a short distance from the drugstore in town. After the last sighting however, it appeared as though Cynthia had vanished. 

Police continued to search throughout the night, however found no trace of her. The following day, around noon, a truck driver from Fort Wayne, Indiana named Raymond Evard, pulled off of Indiana Highway 14 to take a nap. When he awoke, something white protruding from the nearby woods caught his eye. Upon closer inspection he discovered the lifeless body of a young girl with a white cast on her arm. Raymond flagged down another passing truck driver and together, the pair summoned police. 

The body was quickly identified as belonging to Cynthia Warrick. The location Cynthia’s body was found was approximately two miles from New Haven, in a muddy, wooded area, 37 feet off of Highway 14. She was found partially nude, and had multiple bruises and lacerations on her face and head. An autopsy would conclude however, that Cynthia’s killer had ultimately strangled her to death with a rope. The autopsy also confirmed that Cynthia had been sexually assaulted. 

Cynthia was laid to rest the following Friday in Greenlawn Cemetery. Her parents, two brothers, and her eleven classmates accompanied by their teacher and school principal attended the small funeral service. News of Cynthia’s murder rocked the small town of New Haven. A group of local business owners and citizens rallied together and raised more than 2,000 dollars as a reward for information about her murder, however the few tips they received ultimately led nowhere. Sadly, with few clues and no suspects her case quickly faded from the headlines. 

52 years later, the murder of Cynthia Warrick remains unsolved.

420,JonWilso,[],1638399346,"On September 23 1981, 13-year-old Heather Porter went missing from her Halethorpe neighborhood. A day later, a man walking his dog discovered the teen’s body in a wooded area near Ridgewood Road and Goucher Boulevard in Towson. Based on the condition of the victim’s body, investigators believed the person responsible dragged the girl’s body into the woods. An autopsy later determined the teen had been strangled and sexually assaulted.

While detectives had a DNA sample of the suspect, it has taken decades and advancements in DNA technology to identify a suspect. Baltimore County detectives with the BCoPD Homicide Cold Case Squad, reviewed the Porter case and requested the suspect’s DNA profile be submitted for forensic genealogy. Bode Technology analyzed the sample and forwarded their results to the FBI for further analysis.

In February of 2021, results identified John Anthony Petrecca, Jr., as a possible suspect in the murder of 13-year-old Heather Porter. A check of Petrecca’s criminal history showed prior arrests for rape in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Baltimore County Homicide Cold Case detectives determined, at the time of the killing, Petrecca resided in the 100 block of Ridge Ave., in Halethorpe, Maryland. The location is a short distance from where Heather Porter was last seen. 

In an effort to identify Porter’s killer, detectives obtained written authorization from the Baltimore County State’s Attorney’s Office to exhume Petrecca’s remains.On the morning of March 11, 2021, police personnel and members from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner gathered at a local cemetery in Baltimore County where Petrecca was buried in 2000.DNA recovered during the exhumation process was sent to Bode Technology for processing. 

On November 12, 2021, detectives learned the DNA obtained from Petrecca matched that of the suspect’s DNA profile. As a result of advances in forensic technology, Heather Porter’s family members now know the identity of the person who took their loved ones life. The Baltimore County Police Department would like to thank Bode Technology, the Hackerman Foundation and the FBI for their expert analysis, assistance and support in solving this cold case.

421,CherryBlossom724,[],1638397065,"* **The Newton family**

Francis Newton was born in New Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1853. He moved to Brookfield, MA, as a young man where he got a job as a milkman. Later on, he managed a bakery in Hartford, Connecticut, and married a woman named Sarah. Together, the two adopted a baby girl from Sweden, whom they named Ethel and whose nickname was ""Elsie"". They continued to live in Hartford until 1896, when they moved into a dilapidated home on Sturbridge Road in a rural area of Brookfield. Francis worked hard to fix up their new home and barn, and made their property into ""a very fair farm"". 

Paul Mueller, a German immigrant, arrived at the Point of Pines resort, north of Sturbridge, MA, in 1897. He was poor and looking for work. The man who ran the resort, Captain H. D. Hodgson, offered to allow Mueller to stay at his resort for free in exchange for doing carpentry (at which Mueller was said to be very skilled) and repair work. During his time there, Mueller even built a brace (something he claimed to have learned in the German army) for a horse's leg, saving the horse's life. 

In October, 1897, Mueller and Hodgson had a falling out, the reason for which is unknown, and Mueller left the Point of Pines resort. In need of a new living arrangement, Mueller sought employment from Francis Newton, whose farmhouse was only a few miles from the Point of Pines resort. Newton agreed to hire him and in addition to paying him for his work (something that Hodgson never did), he also allowed Mueller to live with him and his family, giving him his own room to stay in. Newton was reportedly pleased with Mueller's work and Mueller himself was described as being generally ""efficient and agreeable"", though he was known to have a bad temper at times. 

The last time any member of the Newton family had been seen alive was on January 7th, 1898. Their neighbors, Elmer Newcomb, William Bemis, and William Eaton started to become concerned when they noticed that the Newtons' cows were lowing loudly and desperately and found, upon investigation, that they were unfed and that they hadn't been milked in a couple of days. It was not at all like Francis Newton to neglect his livestock, but his neighbors didn't assume the worst just yet. Their best guess at this point was that the family had decided to leave for the weekend and just didn't tell anyone. After another day went by with no sign of the Newton family, Eaton and Newcomb decided to form a search party and the group went over to the Newtons' house around 10pm. No one answered their knocks or calls, except for the Newtons' dog, who was barking frantically. They walked around the house and found an unlocked window and entered that way. They found Francis, Sarah and Elsie dead in their respective beds, each having been bludgeoned to death (apparently in their sleep) by the blunt side of an axe. Nothing appeared to have been stolen and there was no evidence of sexual assault.

The doors were locked from the inside and it appears that the killer attempted to set the house on fire before he left, as there was a pile of wood soaked in kerosene inside, but only a few sticks had caught on fire and then fizzled out before the fire could spread to the kerosene soaked wood. Conspicuously absent from this scene was the farmhand Paul Mueller, who had last been seen buying a train ticket nearby at 1:05am on the (presumed) night of the murders. Mueller, being the obvious suspect here, (though it's unclear what his motive was) was searched for by detectives but was never found.

This brings me to my next point. The authors of *The Man from the Train: The Solving of a Century-Old Serial Killer Mystery* believe that this case was just the first in a long series of murders by Paul Mueller. From their extensive research, they feel certain (or just reasonably certain in some of these cases) that the following series of axe murders were all committed by Mueller:

* **The Moore family** (8 victims, including two sisters named Lena and Ina Mae Stillinger who were friends with the oldest daughter, Mary Katherine Moore) was murdered on June 10, 1912, in Villisca, Iowa. This is by far the most famous of these cases.

* **The Pfanschmidt family** (4 victims) was murdered on September 27, 1912.


It's important to note that in many of these cases a suspect was arrested, though often based on little to no evidence. In some of these cases the suspect was released before the case went to trial. In a couple cases, someone was convicted of the crime but later released due to the belief that this person had been wrongfully convicted. In other cases someone was convicted and eventually executed (or murdered by a lynch mob).

However, in all of these cases most (or in some cases all) of the following elements were present:

* The blunt side of the axe was used

* The axe belonged to the victims and was left at or near the crime scene after the murders

* A young girl was present in most of these cases and this serial killer seemed to have a fixation on young girls. Often times, the body of a young girl was the only one that the killer seemed to pay much attention to and was posed postmortem. It is also hinted at in several cases that the killer masturbated over the dead body of a young girl.

* The mirrors were covered in cloth. The heads of the victims were covered with a blanket.

* The crimes took place in rural areas or small towns

* Close proximity to the railroad tracks (typically within a quarter of a mile) and in many cases the location was near the intersection of two railroad lines

* The murderer either setting fire to the house or locking it up tight and/or jamming the door before leaving

* Leaving a lamp burning without its glass chimney at the crime scene

* Nothing being stolen, despite valuables being left out in plain sight

At a few crime scenes, bloody size six footprints were found leading away from the property. 

For reference, here is Paul Mueller's description: He was a short man, with long greasy dark hair, a mustache and occasionally a beard. He was said to be about 35 in 1898. He had small, widely spaced teeth and wore a *size six* in shoes.

Many of these crimes occurred in logging areas, so the authors believe that it's possible that the killer may have worked in the logging industry.

Alexandre was a 20 year old young man. On the 22nd of February 2002, he had gone out to drink with friends at said friends' home at  11 150 , 127th street in Saint-George. At around 9 pm, Alexandre's friends wanted to go out to grab a bite to eat, but Alexandre felt too inhebriated and decided to stay put and wait for his friends to come back.

By the time his friends came back, the house was completely ablaze. His friends naturally thought that Alexandre was in the house while it was burning and that he had died as a result. 

However, on the next morning, officers from the Sureté du Québec (Quebec provincial police) who were investigating the scene of the fire could not find any trace of a body inside the ruins of the burnt-down house.  However, they would confirm that the fire had started under suspect conditions.

According to people interviewed afterwards, it seems that Alexandre was hanging out with questionable people and that it might have led to problems for him.

His mother would bring up an incident from the day before his disappearance where Alexandre had called her and said he ""had something to talk about"" with her. When pressed to be more specific about it, Alexandre had told her that it ""was not something that can be discussed over the phone"".

She is also convinced that something bad had to have happened that night because, acccording to her, Alexandre was absolutely not the kind of person who'd just burn his friend's house down and then take off to go on a road trip across the country without warning anybody.

But at the same time. While they knew their son struggled with substance abuse problems and had questionable relations, they couldn't imagine Alexandre doing something so bad that he'd get murdered over it.

Almost 20 years later, the case is still unsolved and no traces of Alexandre have been found after repeated searches of the location where the house used to stand.

425,Puzzleworth,[],1638366711,"A 22-year-old cold case is believed to have been solved. On Tuesday NYPD arrested **Joseph Martinez,** 49, of New Rochelle, on charges relating to the 1999 abduction, rape, and murder of 13-year-old Bronx girl Minerliz ""Minnie"" Soriano. 

This marks the first time the NYPD has used partial DNA matching to identify a suspect. DNA evidence taken from Minerliz's hoodie produced a familial match in a state database, pointing to a close relative of the source's as the killer.

* Case background 

On February 24, 1999, 13-year-old Minerliz (pronounced min-AIR-leese) Soriano, who went by Minnie, was abducted on the way home from her middle school in the Bronx. Her body was found four days later in a dumpster, sexually assaulted and strangled. 

The case quickly went cold. Investigators initially focused on Soriano's stepfather and a handyman at their apartment complex, but both had alibis. They also questioned residents of the complex and the teenager's many friends and relatives. All were cleared. All that the killer left behind was a patch of DNA that had no matches.

* Recent developments 

The murder of Minnie Soriano went unsolved for 22 years. But in 2021, NYPD detectives decided to try a relatively new investigative technique called ""familial DNA matching."" Unlike their previous DNA database searches, which relied on a 100% identical profile, familial matching looks for partial matches indicating closely related sources.* 

Using this technique, detectives found a very close relative of Minnie's killer--likely his biological father. That man had since died, but investigators tracked down his son, Joseph Martinez. Martinez lived in the same apartment as the Soriano family in 1999, and was even questioned in the initial investigation, but was never a suspect. Investigators obtained a sample of Martinez's DNA and found it was a 100% match to the sample taken from Minnie's sweater.

On November 30, 2021, the NYPD arrested Joseph Martinez. He was arraigned and pled not guilty to murder. Martinez, 49, is an amateur astronomer and Youtuber under the name ""Jupiter Joe."" He was a fixture in local parks, where he offered passers-by lessons in astronomy and a look at the stars through his telescope.

Minnie's family expressed their relief to reporters, but said the arrest comes far too late to bring closure. They mourn everyday for the girl taken so painfully from them on that day in February, 22 years ago. Minnie's relatives remember her as a kind, diligent young girl who loved to write poetry, ride her bike or roller-skate around the complex, and read romance novels. Neighbors called her the ""Cinderella"" of their apartment complex. 

Minnie's family also spoke of their disgust with her killer. Her aunt Amelia Soriano said ""He threw her in the garbage--in the dumpster, [like] she was the garbage. She was not garbage, she was a human being."" Her father, Luis, had only this to say to Martinez: ""I hope you go to hell.""

*Note that the technique used in this case is different from forensic genetic genealogy, which is the process used most famously in the Golden State Killer investigation. FGG uses very distant (second or more cousin-level) matches to build a family tree of the suspect. Investigators in this case were only looking for nuclear family matches of the suspect. They did not use public genetic databases like GEDMatch or 23andMe. Martinez's father was in the state offenders' database as he served time in a New York prison for unknown reasons.

Sure, when you have a missing person it is important to examine the events leading up to the disappearance, but I think people get way to caught up on all the little details of her life. The events beforehand are only relevant in the sense that they explain why she took off in the first place: she was under a great deal of stress and simply wanted to get away for a few days. I don’t think any of it has anything to do with what happened to her after the accident.

On July 8th, 2002, a homeless man wandering through the cold San Francisco winds stumbled onto the streets of Treat Ave and 17th/18th Street.  Known as the Mission District, this area was known for its Latino culture and colorful art that painted the shops and stores up and down the block. Seeing a trashcan, he decided to wheel it down the block. After finally opening the container,he would discover the lifeless body of a young woman stuffed face first in a trash can, later to be identified as recent high school graduate, Nadine Reyes. 

Nadine Reyes had recently graduated high school and turned 18 years old. Residing in Sacramento, CA for her last years of high school, the teen had done quite a bit of moving. First attending high school in San Francisco before finally graduating at Del Campo High School in Sacramento. Though not mentioned in the articles, I found a few high school friends that vividly remember Nadine, and it revealed why the teen attended several high schools.

Nadine’s father, Stephen Reyes, and other family members described the teen as “a good student who was about to join the Army”. Her obituary lists the teen as a member of the JROTC. However, her high school mates remember a different, more promiscuous Nadine. It was apparently a well known fact that she was involved in a couple sex scandals at Thurgood Marshall High, resulting in her having to transfer to Raoul Wallenberg Traditional High in early 1999 while still in her freshman year. At this new school, she continued to be proud of her hyper- sexuality, gloating about being sexually active. Nadine was even reportedly caught in the bathroom with several boys. Sometime between 2000 and 2001, the teen moved from her father’s in SF to her mother’s home in Sacramento. 

While living in Sacramento, the teen kept in touch with her SF friends. Allegedly weeks before being found deceased, she reached out to one of those friends to confess that she was working as a prostitute and “hated” it. She would also confide in this friend an even deeper secret: she was being molested by a close family member and had been for years. 

Weeks after the teens brutally chilling confession, she decided to celebrate her 18th birthday in San Francisco. She had also just graduated high school. While in San Francisco, she intended to visit her father and his family and some of her old friends. On July 2nd 2002 , the same day as her birthday, Nadine headed to San Francisco. Only July 3, she visited her father and phoned an Aunt  and that would be the last time the teen is seen. No missing person report has ever been found to be filed. And days later, the teens body is found stuffed into trash can.

Nadine’s murderer has never been caught and no suspects have been named over the 19 years since her death. Did the teen’s alternative lifestyle play a role in her death? Did she meet someone for a “date”? The are several hotels in the area, could one have been the original crime scene? 

20 years later, no leads and no suspects. Someone knows what happened. A young, beautiful teen, scared by sexual abuse. I can’t imagine what she may have gone through.

The murder of 16 year old Kim Bryant has been solved through DNA testing. 
On Jan. 26, 1979, Bryant was reported missing when she didn’t return home from school. She had gone there to register for classes. The Western High school sophomore was last seen that morning near a Dairy Queen restaurant on Decatur Boulevard near U.S. 95. Her body was found on Feb. 20 in a desert area near Charleston Boulevard and Buffalo Drive.

Police determined that Bryant was abducted, sexually assaulted, and killed. The man responsible was 19 year old Johnny Peterson, who died in 1993. 

The same Texas-based forensic sequencing lab, Othram Inc., that solved the Bryant case also solved another Las Vegas cold case earlier this year involving the 1989 murder of 14-year-old Stephanie Isaacson. The suspect in her case was Darren Marchand. He died by suicide in 1995. His DNA was matched to the Isaacson crime scene and one other murder scene.

Police searching for the bodies of missing Victorian campers Russell Hill and Carol Clay have found human remains in bushland near Dargo, in the state's remote High Country.

Dozens of officers have been scouring a camping ground at the site of a former gold mining town called Grant in Victoria's east, looking for the bodies of the pair.

The campers went missing from their remote Wonangatta Valley campsite in March, 2020.

Last week, Caroline Springs man and former Jetstar pilot Greg Lynn was charged with two counts of murder in relation to their disappearance.

He has been remanded in custody until a court hearing scheduled for May next year, and is yet to enter a plea.

Police said the remains were yet to be identified.

The discovery comes after five unmarked police cars were seen travelling to the remote search site early on Tuesday morning.

Dense shrub and dangerous terrain have made the search difficult.

Police had postponed their investigation over the weekend, with wet weather hindering their efforts.

Clearer weather on Monday aided investigators, and police were seen carting an all-terrain buggy to the search site.

It is expected it will take some time for investigators to formally identify the remains.",Human remains discovered in the search for Russel Hill and Carol Clay

Daryl Crouch was murdered by a pipe style car bomb placed under the seat of his Mercedes coupe.  He was 36 and his wife and daughter were right beside the blast and suffered minor injuries.  


He was 36 and had no known enemies and served on a few local boards.  Was head of Walsh Lumpkin (a company that made things for medical care) and was involved with humco manufacturing, etc.  None made narcotics or had any dealings that were exposed that showed any immoral or illicit dealings.  


I've never heard any reason for his death only a person that may have been involved. Local information is that the device was remotely detonated.  Meaning someone likely targeted him.   He was a young man with a promising career taken from him.  No one has ever seen justice.  

I've only seen photos of the car aftermath and not the device used or anything.  He deserves some time of justice for this.

439,crystalized17,[],1638237596,"I may have spent all day reading everyone else’s theories and compiling what I think is the most reasonable explanation…. Feel free to add to it or refute below.

Whoever committed the crime was a genius mastermind or super lucky.

If Lizzie did it:      

1. Lizzie was not naked. She wore one of her father’s coats on backwards to protect her dress. And then she folded it up and put it next to his head. I think she wore the coat for murdering the stepmother, took it back off, and then put it back on later to murder the father. She wrapped a scarf or something around her head to keep her hair clean and she was barefoot to avoid her shoes getting splattered. Anything she wrapped around her head could be hidden amongst her menstrual rags. The dress she burned had nothing to do with it, even though it was idiotically stupid to burn it because it made her look more guilty. She is a criminal mastermind, but also really stupid when what she’s doing is truly an innocent act.
2. Murdering the stepmother was planned. Murdering the father was less-planned, though happy to take the opportunity when it arrived. Maybe the father would have been murdered at a later date if no opportunity presented itself on that day.
3. The stepmother was attacked by someone she knew. Hence why Bridget never heard any screams. Even if she was outside washing windows, surely a woman screaming because a total stranger has entered the room would alert her. Which means stepmother was attacked by a face she trusted and wasn’t given enough time to scream. Bridget being outside is the only reason she didn’t hear the body thud to the floor.
4. The “giggle” Bridget hears is probably Lizzie. It could be the dead body releasing gas or gurgling in some way, but Bridget seems to think it is a human voice.
5. Lizzie tries to get Bridget to go fabric shopping to get her to leave the house again. Bridget chooses to lie down on her bed on the 3rd floor. Lizzie didn’t know her father would come home early, but she sees an opportunity. She just has to get Bridget out of the way.
6. Lizzie tells those lies about the stepmother being gone so he doesn’t go looking for her upstairs.
7. The ax or whatever she used was put in the cellar or thrown onto the roof or hidden in plain sight.
8. She wanted the money. Her dad might soon die of old age, and then leave all the money to the wife. There might of been other perceived wrongs or abuses (we have no proof), or she may have just been incredibly angry over her inheritance being passed to someone else. Emma and others may suspect what happened, but as long as they get their inheritance too, they don’t care. They too were angry about the inheritance going to the wife, but they just weren’t as psycho as Lizzie to enact actual murder.
9. Despite how much they harp on about what a good Christian woman she is, we know she was quite the thief. If she can teach Sunday school, but then go out and steal stuff, then that means it’s an act and she doesn’t fully believe in it.
10. Lizzie might have talked thru her plan with the uncle, so he could look for flaws or blind spots in her plan. But I think it was all her and his only job was to have a solid alibi and not be involved.

If it was not Lizzie herself that swung the ax, then she 100% hired someone and let them inside and helped smuggle them out. But it’s harder for me to believe this since as far as we know, no mysterious payments were sent to anyone nor did anyone ever get caught bragging about what they had done etc.       
It’s hard enough for me to believe the uncle was in on it, despite his odd behavior, just because it’s easier to keep a crime secret if you’re the only one who knows what really happened.      
I think Bridget was absolutely terrified and not in on it at all. I think she’s lucky Lizzie didn’t murder her too, which might have happened if Lizzie hadn’t been able to get her to leave the first floor where her father was.      
But I think she wanted to leave Bridget alive so there would be someone there to bear witness to Lizzie being cleanly dressed with no signs of blood.    

I could believe she was just a good Christian woman in the wrong place at the wrong time, it’s certainly happened before *(Lindy Chamberlain),* but we know she was a repeat thief and therefore not a good Christian woman. Plus, all of the strange excuses *(lies)* she had for why she wasn’t there to hear these murders in the house.

She may or may not have tried to purchase poison. That doesn’t really matter to me. What I think stumped them is they couldn’t figure out how she stayed clean of the blood, when it was really her father’s coat that saved her. Going totally naked is too outlandish and unnecessary. She just needed something that could be hidden in plain sight. I think the same for the murder weapon, whatever it was, it was something that could be disposed of quickly or hidden in plain sight.

The three properties of ""significant"" interest, where searches will begin from 9am, are located at Bellevue Hill, Bondi Beach and Potts Point.
Ms Balmain, then aged 22, was last seen in the Kingsford area on November 5, 1994.  

&gt;Her personal property – including a make-up bag, keys and a shoe – was later found scattered near Ainslie Street.
She was reported missing later that evening and hasn't been seen or heard from since.
""We are now exploring a new line of inquiry and believe these locations are of significance and will help us progress the investigation,"" Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Bell said.
A $1 million reward for information about Ms Balmain's disappearance, announced in May, was linked to today's sudden search developments.
""Following the $1 million reward announcement and additional public appeals for information, we are now exploring a number of new lines of inquiry,"" Detective Chief Inspector Bell said.
""This includes whether Revelle was scheduled to meet with any individuals – clients, friends or associates – previously unknown to police, on the evening of her disappearance.""
Despite extensive investigations by local police at the time and over the years, no one has been charged in relation to her disappearance.
Before her disappearance, Ms Balmain had told friends she had fallen in love and was about to embark on a six-week dance tour of Japan.
She was working as a sex worker but November 5, the day she was last seen alive, was meant to be her last shift.
But she wasn't seen again publicly after her agency's driver dropped her at an address in Kingsford.
Ms Balmain's boyfriend at the time reported her missing that night, followed by her mother the next day.
A 1999 coronial inquest found Ms Balmain had died at the hands of a person or persons unknown, and the matter was referred to the Unsolved Homicide Unit for future investigation. ""

I remember seeing Revelle's picture on the missing posters around Sydney train stations back in the 90s.  For some reason I always connected her with Caroline Byrne who died at The Gap in Sydney - Gordon Wood was convicted of her murder but had his conviction quashed later - most people still think he's guilty I would bet.  Anyway I probably only conflated them because they were both models and died or disappeared around the same time.  Revelle was a bit more fringe though as she worked as an escort occasionally and many believe police weren't as thorough for this reason.    
  
I wonder what has brought forth the new interest in this case.  NSW Police have put up a number of $1 million rewards lately and Revelle's case was upgraded to this amount in May this year.  
  
Everything points towards her murder but with no body or clear suspect it remains a long standing Sydney mystery.  Here's hoping for some closure for her family.","Search for Revelle Balmain clues at three properties in Sydney's east, as police chase 'significant' lead (missing since 1994)"
441,Academic_Internet,[],1638218285,"The Vanished Podcast just put out an episode about James today and I was blown away by how weird this case is. There is not a ton of information out there but I encourage you to[listen to the podcast episode](http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/episodes) to get the entire story and all the details. There is frustratingly little info out there. From a news article linked below:

**Chance is described as 6’1” tall, weighing about 175 pounds, with red hair and blue/green eyes.**

**His vehicle was found abandoned at the Arkansas Welcome Center on I-30, just northeast of Texarkana in March.**

**While detectives said there are no signs of foul play, they have exhausted all leads to include having the Welcome Center and area surrounding it searched by K9 teams. Detectives are seeking information from any acquaintances who may have knowledge about his whereabouts.**

The podcast has way more info and the details are weird. James disappeared sometime between January and March 2021, no one is exactly sure of the date. He had some of his bills on autopay because he had a large sum of money from selling a property he owned (I believe it was a second home). Most of Texas was out of electricity during the time he went missing, but his apartment building did not lose power. His landlord let his family know he was missing after he autopaid rent for two months and then stopped paying. 

The podcast episode is interesting because it's clear his family members who are interviewed are in the dark about his life. He did not stay in regular contact with his family and they didn't even know he hadn't had a job in years. IMO it would be very likely he had a completely separate life from them that he kept secret. They checked his phone records and the only calls were regular calls to a pizza place, a utilities company, and somewhere else mundane. There were no personal calls to friends or family or text messages at all. In one month he sent 2 text messages, and only 19 the next month before he went missing. 

One thing that made me think he may be living a double life is that a family member (perhaps his mother?) on the podcast was talking about how in the early days of the pandemic he was ""overreacting"" and had rules for going to the grocery store and was ""panicked about COVID"". The family member said he wouldn't come visit them and said they hadn't seen people in two weeks so it shouldn't have been a big deal. They really stressed that he seemed paranoid about COVID but IMO --- this is how everyone I know was behaving in the early days of the pandemic. Most people I know did not see ANYONE for months and wiped down groceries or wore gloves to the grocery store, and there were several months where it felt absurd to even consider traveling to see family especially pre-vaccine, so I don't think his actions here show that he was being paranoid - instead, I think it demonstrates the incongruencies between his beliefs and his family's.

When you look at the some of the cases you've researched, is there usually some aspect of them that many of them seem to have in common? I'm not talking about cases that you think could have the same perpetrator or suspect. I'm referring more here to specific types of cases.

I tend to be drawn to cases where there's just enough info to be mysterious, but little else. One such case that I've started threads on but got little in the way of responses (presumably due to said lack of info) is the 1983 disappearance of [Grace Esquivel ](https://charleyproject.org/case/graciela-esquivel). A woman leaves her child with her parents overnight to go out with friends. When her parents came back to her house the next morning to drop off the granddaughter, Grace is nowhere to be found despite no signs of a struggle and everything in the house (including her car, keys, and wallet) being intact. Very mysterious, right? And yet outside of Charley Project and a few other sites, there's basically no other information about this case. Not necessarily unheard of for cases in the pre-internet age, but kind of frustrating.  

I also tend to gravitate toward cases from the pre-internet age (often from 70s and 80s). With so much information constantly at our fingertips about more recent cases, I find it sometimes overwhelming  to sort through. I like to be able to read and digest things at my own pace as well as the challenge of researching. I live in central Florida and only about a year ago, started reading a little bit into the Casey Anthony case. Without it being in the media so much, I feel like I can kind of take my time and form my own opinions.

I ran across a court of appeals case dealing with a trust issue, that involved both Shelden and Starchild.

Including a deposition made while Shelden was a fugitive in Europe. 

From the case, I though it was interesting Shelden was permitted to give a deposition while a fugitive:

   *Over the objection of Appellants, on November 24, 1981 Judge Joiner ordered that the deposition be taken de bene esse in the Netherlands at a date and time to be arranged between counsel for the parties. Full opportunity to be present for the deposition was accorded by the district court to counsel for Appellants, but they did not participate.* 

This is Shelden's version of why he fled, and how:

*In July 1976 Shelden received a telephone call from Deyer Grossman who said that a mutual acquaintance by the name of Gerald Richards was having severe ""difficulties"" and that Richards might involve Shelden in these ""difficulties""; and that Shelden might become the subject of blackmail by Richards. Shelden testified that Grossman ""suggested that it might be wise for me to leave the country for awhile . . . to await events."" Shelden said that his immediate concern was protecting his assets, especially his negotiable stocks. He asked Grossman for advice. Grossman suggested that Shelden contact Adam Starchild, an investment counselor specializing in offshore investments. Shelden had never met Starchild but telephoned him in New Jersey and asked for his advice. Starchild recommended that Shelden bring his stock certificates to New Jersey and discuss the matter with him further.*

444,mysteryconfidential,[],1638200896,"**Where is David Miscavige’s Wife?**

Scientology is one of the most controversial ‘religions’ in the world. This is due in part because of their high-profile celebrity connections, their strange genesis (from the wicked imaginings of a Science Fiction writer — L. Ron Hubbard), their history of ‘shunning’ those that they deem suppressive to the belief system and the reputation of being an expensive religion for their disciples.

Scientology gained a lot of notoriety within their short fifty-year history with films based on their lure (Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master), documentaries about the inner workings of their organisation (Going Clear by Lawrence Wright) and some of the most famous people in the world propping up their public image or former members that are ‘exposing’ the truth behind the religion (actress Leah Remini’s more recent defection).

From their less than humble origins to their status as an official religion in the USA (according to the IRS), and outlawing the religion in countries such as Germany and France — Scientology has been shrouded in mystery, dodgy press and the church has arguably been damaging to many of their celebrities’ reputations (Tom Cruise’s image has certainly taken a hit).

But one mystery that has somewhat been swept under the rug is the disappearance of Shelly Miscavige, wife of the COB (Chairman of the Board) David Miscavige.

David Miscavige is the current leader of the church and has the designation of **“Chairman of the Board”** as well as **“Captain of the Sea Org.”** The Sea-Org was a literal Navy originally commanded by Hubbard himself which sailed the high-seas in the name of Scientology.

David Miscavige is a close personal friend to Tom Cruise. David was an original deputy to the late founder L. Ron Hubbard and had been working in the upper hierarchy of the Church since he was a teenager. David’s rise to the top of the church has been meteoric. From humble beginnings in Pennsylvania (where he maintains a thick Philly accent) to COB for Scientology. Although David’s reign as head of the church has seen the religion unquestionably rise and rise, and despite the numerous controversies Miscavige has been linked to (beatings, imprisonment, bullying, vulgar behaviour towards underlings) — the *real* hot question that remains unanswered as far Mr. Miscavige is concerned is — where is Shelly Miscavige — the leader’s wife.

**Shelly Miscavige**

**Shelly was last seen publicly in August 2007 (some reports state 2006).** 

**Apparently, the week before Shelly’s disappearance, David went ballistic at his wife while she carried out late night administration on behalf of the church. This was the same week that her father died.** 

It was actress Leah Remini that brought the missing spouse to the forefront of public consciousness. Leah Remini is famous for her role as sassy Carrie Heffernan on the extremely popular sitcom the King of Queens. But Leah was also a devout Scientologist during her stint on King of Queens and her recent defection has seen her labelled as an enemy of the church.

Remini spent millions of her own money to fund the church (as well as $300,000 to leave the Church) and Leah had the inside ear of the church during her time within. Remini attended Tom Cruise’s wedding to Katie Holmes in 2006 and it was there that she first noticed that the First Lady of Scientology was not in attendance at the Scientologist’ event of the century. She questioned where Shelly was, as amicably as possible, to David and was dressed down by church officials with the words “you don’t ever ask about Shelly.” Leah was taken to one side and severely remonstrated for asking the question about the missing wife.

***“You do not ask about Shelly!”***

Leah’s break from the church came soon after this incident and this has been extremely acrimonious. In 2013 Remini filed a missing person report for Shelly with the Los Angeles Police Department — which the LAPD decided not to pursue.

Rumour has it that Shelly’s initial transgression (and where the ‘split’ started) was for filling out job applications without David’s knowledge or permission (as reported by The New Yorker’s Lawrence Wright). Shelly was also concerned about David’s cold and hostile behaviour towards her and allegedly had stopped wearing his wedding ring (or so Shelly believed).

Misbehaving Scientologists have been known to allegedly get themselves locked up in “The Hole” — a group of buildings where people are held ‘captive’.

**Scientology denies the existence of any holes.**

Since her lack of whereabouts there has been rampant speculation and intrigue into where exactly Shelly is. David Miscavige’s own father Ron Miscavige gave an interview to Australia’s Sixty Minutes in 2019 where he was quoted as saying the following:

***“Shelly*****,** ***she’ll never be free… I know it’s difficult to believe, but the worst thing about this is that I’m telling you the truth… they don’t have a conscious and that lets them do it…”***

When asked if she believed Shelly to be alive a stone-faced Leah Remini said:

***“I hope so.”***

Ron Miscavige left the church in 2012 and was subsequently shunned by his own son David since his departure. This is a common act in Scientology. Those that wish to leave the church will be deemed a ‘Suppressive Person’ by those within the church and all contact must cease immediately. This of course is a common trait of many “destructive cults”. The philosophy that — those that are not with us will therefore be deemed as against us. David has shunned his own father. And the rumour mill believes that Shelly has been forced away from both the church and the public eye in the same way David did to his own father Ron. Thereby Shelly is deemed a SP (a Suppressive Person).

The LAPD police have stated they will not pursue any missing persons enquiries into her disappearance deeming the missing persons report is “unfounded.”

**The Hole**

“There was no end” — Mike Rinder on the Hole.

The Hole is an unofficial nickname for the Scientology Gold Base. Located in the town of Hemet in Riverside County, California. It is two double wide trailers joined together with bars on the windows and guards on the door.

Mike Rinder (former international spokesperson of the church) was ‘imprisoned’ in the Hole for two years. Rinder claims that he was beaten by David Miscavige *many many* times. Rinder also claims that he has witnessed beatings from Miscavige hundreds of times. Mike Rinder was sent to the hole under the pretext of lengthy reflection.

The purpose of the Hole (which the church denies is a prison) was an intended place of both reflection and ‘figuring’ it out for residents. However, the claim is that the Hole is a prison and many people have been subject to imprisonment for over a decade. The Hole could very well be hiding the former Queen of Scientology — Shelly Miscavige.

In July 2012 the speculation was finally addressed by the Church where they wrote a letter to two UK newspapers stated that Shelly is fine and devotes most of her time to the church and cannot be deemed as “missing.”

**A Match Made in Xenu**

The Miscaviges — Reincarnated South American revolutionaries and now modern day Religious leaders.

When David married Shelly in December 1982, Shelly viewed Miscavige as the reincarnation of Simon Bolivar. While Shelly herself viewed herself as Manuela Sáenz. The pedestal of which they placed themselves was a very strange and yet, very large one.

Shelly had been within the church since the age of 12. Supportive of her husband’s rapid rise within the Church, Shelly’s own mother had died in 1985 from three rifle shots to the check and a superficial slash mark on her wrists — the death was deemed a suicide. A former Scientologist remarked to hear David Miscavige state that ‘the bitch got what she deserved’ when he mentioned his Mother-in-Law’s death.

The fall-out of Shelly’s mother’s unusual death and the preceding divorce from the church did not affect her status during this period. Shelly was closely involved in the Church’s relationship with the Church’s highest profile member, Tom Cruise.

Shelly helped audit (think Catholic confessional) Penelope Cruz when she first entered the Church of Scientology during her relationship with Tom Cruise. Shelly was involved in the Purification Rundown program endorsed by the church. After the Cruise-Cruz breakup Shelly was allegedly heavily involved in the pursuit to find Tom Cruise a new partner (which eventually lead to his relationship with Katie Holmes).

Shelly’s role within the Church was clearly not pedestrian. She was (or still is…) an active member with high profile relationships and rigorous programmes within Scientology.

**So, where is Shelly?**

Shelly had spent her whole life conveying orders and gathering intelligence for her husband. She and David had a respectful relationship towards one another in public. In the eyes of other Sea Org members Shelly was brittle and imperious. However; she was also one of the only members that openly challenged David Miscavige’s physical assaults against Scientology members. She may have strayed just a bit too close to the sun in challenging her husband.

***“She’ll be out of sight and out of mind until the day she dies.”***

***A former Scientology member.***

There’s very little concrete to go on beyond rampant speculation (and we all want to avoid any slander suits from the church). However, what we do know is that Scientology has (rightly or wrongly) been labelled a cult with a history of purging those that they deem to be enemies.

We know that allegations have been made that David Miscavige is a violent bully with further allegations of humiliating and degrading behaviour towards those beneath Mr. Miscavige. He is not adverse to violence, intimidation and ‘shutting people away’.

We know that a pseudo prison is operating in California and that members are given lengthy periods of ‘reflection.’ We know that David Miscavige’s wife has not (or barely) been seen since 2007 and we know that, despite LAPD’s lack of interest in the case, there have been demands by Miscavige’s own family to know where Shelly Miscavige is.

She is more than likely still alive. But what kind of life would that be if you are being heavily suppressed by a destructive cult. A morbidly punishing life.

Wherever she is… we should all wish her well.

446,AckReik03,[],1638169681,"Nearly 30 years after a serial killer terrorized the Midwest, and just days after multiple police agencies and the FBI launched a task force to re-examine the cold case, News 4 has learned there may be a dramatic development unfolding.

Multiple sources close to the investigation tell News 4 they are closely looking at a convenience store homicide in Terre Haute in 2001, nearly 10 years after the I-70 killing spree ended.  Terre Haute, along with Indianapolis, Raytown, Wichita, and here in St. Charles were the sight of random homicide scenes along interstate 70 in 1992.

Tuesday morning, Terre Haute police sergeant Troy Davis confirmed to News 4 there are similarities between the 2001 homicide, and the I-70 homicides.  Davis said investigators have identified a person of interest in the 2001 case. That person is not in custody.

Investigators emphasize they are looking at each case separately before drawing any conclusions at this point.

The 2001 case was a convenience store robbery, where the killer shot and killed clerk Billy Brossman. The shooting occurred just seven blocks from Terre Haute's 1992 homicide scene. Now, according to multiple sources involved in the task force, the Brossman case was discussed at length behind closed doors to see if the suspect could be tied to the I-70 killings.

Investigators are cautious to publicly make any connection between the cases at this point.  But another police source told News 4 he is confident the person who killed Brossman is definitely a suspect as the I-70 serial killer.

Police have long speculated as to why, after killing six people in one month in 1992, the killer suddenly stopped. If the Brossman case can be connected, then he clearly did not.

447,mkultra5252,[],1638155511,"In 1973, Wanda Deann Kirkum was born in Steuben County in New York, and grew up in the rural towns of Hornell and Pavilion. 

In June 2020, police identified Wanda as Valentine Jane Doe, whose body was found on February 15, 1991 in the Florida Keys.

Wanda had a difficult, isolated childhood, and was allegedly abused by her parents, who are both now deceased. By all accounts, Wanda did not have much contact with any extended family, leaving her largely cut off from the outside world. According to Wanda’s cousin Brenda, “I was the only cousin who would play with her and spend the night. I didn’t see much of her. She kept to herself and when her parents would come to my house, she would stay in the car with her mother.”

In keeping with trends at the time, Wanda wore her brown hair in a shaggy mullet and had multiple piercings in both ears. Her life in upstate New York likely felt claustrophobic and bleak— the region is characterized by small farm towns and brutal winters that probably left her daydreaming about sunny, warm beaches far from the abuse and neglect she endured at home.

When she was sixteen, Wanda decided she couldn’t take any more abuse from her parents, and she ran away from home. In a clear sign of their care for their daughter, Wanda’s parents never reported her missing or attempted to find her. According to her extended family, they believed that Wanda had decided to start a new life, but they had drifted away from her and her parents by this point and never suspected she had met foul play.

Details of Wanda’s life from here are scant, although it’s likely she spent a couple of years hitchhiking around the east coast, eventually ending up in southern Florida. With its white, sandy beaches, warm breezes, towering palm trees, and lively, diverse cities, nearby areas like Miami and the Florida Keys must have seemed like a paradise straight out of her childhood dreams. However, investigators do not believe she had been in the state long at the time of her death, as she had no tan lines and was found wearing clothes more suitable for cooler weather.

At some point, Wanda got two tattoos: a heart with the word “Love” in it on her left shoulder, and a tiny cross with sun rays emanating from it near her left thumb. Perhaps these tattoos signified what Wanda wanted so desperately for her future: a life full of love, brightness, and hope. 

Investigators also suspect that she may have carried a baby to full term due to stretch marks on her stomach, however her family denies that she ever gave birth. At the time of her death, Wanda had ovarian and Fallopian tube cysts and was suffering from salpingitis, an inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, which likely would have caused her a great deal of pain. 

On Valentine’s Day 1991, witnesses reported seeing Wanda hitchhiking out of Key West, traveling northbound on U.S. 1 at Mile Markers 10, 15, and 17. She was last seen still hitchhiking at around 6:30 p.m. on U.S. 1, which is the sole route from the Keys to Miami. 

Early the next morning, windsurfers discovered Wanda’s body off of a dirt road in a recreational area approximately 20 miles from where she was last seen. 

The identity of Wanda’s killer is known, and he himself was murdered less than a year after he took Wanda’s life.

Wanda’s short life was an unfair one, full of hardship and loneliness. By all appearances, Wanda was an incredibly brave girl, unwilling to settle for a life of cruelty when she knew she deserved better. Despite having no money or support, Wanda was determined to make a new life for herself that would bring her happiness and contentment, perhaps for the first time. 

After three decades, Wanda’s body was returned to her remaining family and she has been laid to rest.

Hi everyone I’m trying to look into a certain case but I can’t seem to remember the names involved.

I know that it involves a young woman from New Jersey(?). She was part of a well to do family but met a man much older than her, married him and moved to Oklahoma to live with his parents. She got pregnant and had a baby then went missing. She went on a trip(?) with the family in the days before her disappearance. Her body was found some time later in the woods and suspicion is on the husband and parents even though they’ve never been charged with anything. 

I’ve googled these details multiple different ways but can’t seem to find the right sources. Does anyone know?

Mine was solved a few years ago, but the murder of Arlis Perry. I really thought her husband was related to her death in some capacity. It had never even entered my mind that it could’ve been the security guard! 

One solved this year was the murder of Kaitlyn Arquette. Based on the big fight they had, the note he seemed to have forged, and the timing of the breakup, I was so certain it was her boyfriend! There was also a connection to a criminal organization. Paul Apodaca was on the police report, but didn’t seem to be someone the police- or Kait’s mother, Lois Duncan- focused on.

454,powerpuck,[],1638108215,"The ""Hickey Theory"" (Mortal Error/Smoking Gun) was proposed years ago by Maryland gunsmith/marksman Howard Donahue and the subject of a book by Bonar Menninger and a video by Colin McClaren.

But in [this newer information](https://mokan9997.medium.com/what-if-hickey-didnt-pull-the-trigger-dd9fae6a664c) by Menninger the earliest versions of the AR15 which Hickey would have been using had a defectively large firing pin which after cocking and loading would hit the bullet and make it accidentally discharge.

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269NiovMgrs) McClaren repeats Donahues assertion that Hickey picked up the gun, flipped off the safety mechanism, put his finger on the triger, and as he swung around to return fire on Oswald, the car lurched and he accidentally fired at JFK. 

But if you look at transcripts of Hickey's statements, he says ""*I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, and turned to the rear.*""  &lt;-- google that to find it on may JFK assassination sites.

So is it plausible that instead of having an AR15 with a round in the chamber and Hickey accidentally pulling the trigger, that instead there was no round on the chamber and he's ""cocking and loading"" the AR15 as he's turning around and the firing pin ""slamfire"" discharges a bullet toward JFK?",JFK Dallas -&gt; Hickey theory ... could a faulty AR15 firing pin (slamfire) be the culprit?
455,September_Daze,[],1638060922,"*Sorry if this a long read, I wanted to include all available information.*

**Background:**

Fair-haired and blue-eyed, [Christine Vivian Butcher](https://imgur.com/a/6GI852g) was born in April of 1944 in Windsor, a town in Berkshire, England. She was the only daughter of Charles Ernest Butcher (1912 - 1976) and Barbara Eva Butcher (née Quine; 1906 - 1984). She had an older brother named John, who was born in 1939. The family lived on [Peascod Street](https://imgur.com/a/JAN4PvR), near Windsor Castle. From a young age, Christine had an interest in famous people, especially boxers, her favourite of which was the American Sugar Ray Robinson.

**The Disappearance:**

Christine's home was just 30 yards from the [Star and Garter Hotel](https://imgur.com/a/veWRTk5), and on the 8th of July 1951, she found out that Sugar Ray was staying there in preperation for his fight on the 10th against the British middleweight boxer Randy Turpin. Christine had a black porcelain doll she nicknamed 'Blackie' (this was the 1950s!) that she thought looked like Sugar Ray, and she was desparate to show it to him, hoping that the resemblance would impress him so much that he would take her on a ride in his [pink Cadillac](https://imgur.com/a/GWlFlom).

Between 3 and 3:30pm, Christine's mother waved her daughter off as Christine set off on the short walk to the hotel, dressed in a green and white gingham dress and a blue gabardine raincoat and clutching the doll and a small bag of sweets. This would be the last time Christine would be seen alive, and her parents contacted authorities a few hours later (I could not find exactly how long after) when she did not return home when it got dark.

**The Initial Investigation:**

The Berkshire police immediately started their search. It was believed that Christine had reached the entrance of the hotel, 'disappearing' into a crowd of people waiting at the steps, but they found by talking to Sugar Ray that Christine had stepped foot the hotel, as he, anybody in his entourage or any hotel employees had not seen Christine at all. Sniffer dogs and soldiers brought in from the famed Household Cavalry to search the area and draggings of the nearby River Thames also yielded no results.

Christine's connection to Sugar Ray meant that her disappearance was in headlines across the word, the news spreading even to Australia and the USA. Sugar Ray himself was quoted as saying  “I am very sorry about this - if I had known she wanted to see me, her daddy could have brought her in and then this never would have happened.”

However, it would not be until two days later, when attentions had by now turned back to the fight, that the case would get any answers - and unfortunately, they were not happy ones.

**The Discovery:**

On the 10th of July 1951, at dusk, whilst over 18,000 people were travelling to Earls Court to watch Sugar Ray fight Randy Turpin, Christine's body was found in a copse in a meadow near Windsor Castle (a mile away from the hotel) by two members of the public out on a walk. She was found half-dressed, and it was found that she had been raped before sucuumbing to strangulation with the belt of her own raincoat. The porcelain doll and half-eaten bag of sweets that she had been seen with when she set off were found nearby.

It was believed she had been killed on the day that she had disappeared, and exactly where she was found as the pathologist found grass still rooted in the earth was found caught up in the knot of belt used to kill her. 

**Continued Investigation:**

The investigation now ramped up. The police made over 6000 calls to nearby houses were made, and took over 1800 statements - in one, Christine's 15 year-old female friend (?) claimed that she had seen Christine on the 8th, walking with a white man of indeterminate age dressed in a grey suit, and that when she had waved to Christine, the girl had waved back. Furthermore, she said that this man and an 'elderly' man had asked her to sit with her underneath some nearby trees - she declined. Although she said that she would be able to identify this man if she saw him again, her description could not be conclusively matched to anybody. Other witnesses included a coach driver, who said that he had seen Christine (and her doll) watching a sentry in a car park at approximately 4pm, 

The last confirmed sighting of Christine came from a local woman, who saw her at 4:07pm walking behind a group of people down an alley known to locals as 'Drive Slowly Alley' or Death Trap Alley'. It ran down the side of the Star and Garter and was next to the steps that led to the main railway station (it was a shortcut to the River Thames, which runs through Windsor). 

The police also reviewed three donated films that had recorded the masses of people as they waited outside the Star and Garter (one by a local girl, one by Edna Robinson, wife of Sugar Ray and one by a television company). At least one of these films showed Christine among the crowds towards the back, still holding her doll (I'm unsure at what time this was). Whilst this did prove that Christine did make it at least to the hotel's surrounding area, the video did not show where she went after and who with (several people seen near her on the tape were questioned and ruled as suspects).

On the 15th of July, a 're-enactment' of the murder was held by the police in the 45-acre meadow where Christine was found, and whilst over 30,000 people attended, this provided no new leads. 

**Suspects/ Persons of Interest:**

* On the 17th of July, the police made a public appeal for the four adults seen in Death Trap Alley near Christine. They were:

1. A man aged 20 - 25 years-old, 5ft 11in, well-built, wearing a sandy-coloured sports jacket and grey flannel trousers.
2. A woman (with a child).
3. A woman (with a child).
4. A man aged 40 - 45 years-old, 5ft 9in, medium to stocky build, clean shaven.

It was reported that they, at approximately 4pm, they had been discussing the boxing match, with the 20 to 25 year old saying to another ""'I hope Turpin gives him a good hiding."": the other man replied ""Don't worry, he will.""

* The police later announced that they were also searching for a man seen outside Christine's house on the 8th of July. He was hatless, red-faced and approximately 35 years-old.
* Another description of a person of interest was released later in July, possibly of the man above: he was 5ft 10in - 5ft 11in, approximately 35 years-old, with a 'reddish' complexion, fair hair brushed back with a clean shaven face and wearing a plain navy-blue suit but no hat. 

**Aftermath:**

On the 21st of September, the inquest into her death came back with a verdict of 'murder by some person or persons unknown'. 

As the investigation into Christine's case had been unfolding, journalists across the country had been eagerly reporting on it in their papers - and one of these was read by 21 year-old convicted child-rapist [John Thomas Straffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Straffen#Child_killings). Most likely making the connection that murdering (specifically strangling) young girls made massive trouble for the police, Straffen went on in the upcoming weeks and months to kill  5 year-old Brenda Goddard (whose case was initially connected to Christine's) and 9 year-old Cicely Batstone. Although he was soon caught, he actually escaped from Broadmoor Hospital, where he was serving his sentence, in 1952 and killed 5 year-old Linda Bowyer before being recaptured. 

The murder of Christine Butcher remains unsolved today, and her case is currently considered cold.

Despite the cold, it had been a decent day. Late March is sometimes like that in London. More winter than spring, the grass often still frozen half solid underfoot. It’s rarely a time that speaks too loudly of renewal. This year wasn’t any different, as far as I can remember. The occasion that afternoon was a friend’s 30th birthday party, if that’s what you’d call a few faintly desultory beers in a barren Peckham Rye Park.

Back at home, my partner and I had settled down to watch a florid period drama. About half an hour in, that’s when it happened: the moment my life changed. My phone lit up with an unfamiliar name on Facebook Messenger. “Hello Francisco, this might be a shock. It’s your father’s family in Spain. Twenty years may have passed, but we have always remembered you.""*

Body of homicide victim was tampered with, police say

By Kate Allen Staff Reporter
Fri., Aug. 26, 2011
Police launched a second probe into the death of a Gatineau teenager on Thursday, saying they believe the woman’s body was tampered with after she was killed.

Valerie Leblanc, 18, was found dead on Tuesday in a wooded park behind the Gabrielle-Roy campus of the CEGEP de l’Outaouais, where she was a student. Police are calling the death a homicide.

Four teenagers told police they were walking through the park on Tuesday afternoon when they saw smoke rising from an off-trail area. They went to investigate, and discovered Leblanc’s body with evidence of burns and other signs of violence.

The teens later told police that they did not realize the body was real, so they returned to class. Eventually they decided something was wrong and phoned police.

The killing, Gatineau’s first homicide this year, has rocked the community, says Mariane Leduc, a communications officer with the Gatineau police.

“The (school) is in a very quiet neighbourhood. It’s a good neighbourhood. So of course people are shocked and the students are shocked as well,” she said. “It’s very hard on everyone.”

Media outlets have reported that Leblanc and her boyfriend had recently broken up, and that they were seen entering the woods together. But police, while confirming the split between the couple, have said that investigators met with the boyfriend and that he is not considered a suspect.

Since Tuesday, police have sectioned off a huge swath of the park and as of Thursday night were still searching the crime scene. An autopsy report is expected tomorrow.

On Thursday, police launched a parallel investigation to the homicide probe, saying they believe Leblanc’s body was tampered with after her death. They are investigating charges of obstructing justice and causing an indignity to a body.

Officers have identified suspects in the second investigation, but no charges have been laid.

Investigators do not believe that the suspects of the second probe are also Leblanc’s killers. “The people who tampered with the body are not responsible for the death of Valerie,” said Leduc.

Leblanc had just begun her first year of studies at the college, according to police. A vigil in her honour was held Wednesday night.

If you follow the stories of missing people you probably know that there is a epidemic of missing Native American people, so I wanted to share a few of their stories on this very important day. The following pieces were mostly written by myself, but please feel free to add other cases you know of in the comments below.

Bryce Herda, a 7 year old Makah boy disappeared while with a group of relatives at the beach. A local criminal, a nearby homeless encampment, and a sneaker wave have all been looked at as potential culprits. His story can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/g5unfg/a_missing_child_a_nationwide_problem_and_a_serial/)

Teekah Lewis, a two year old girl of Chippewa, African American, and Caucasian descent went missing from a bowling alley in Tacoma, Washington. She was abducted but has never been found. Her story can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/fm3yhc/timeline_and_lengthy_write_up_of_the_teekah_lewis/).

Helen Doe, an unidentified woman of Native American or Hispanic descent, died in a fiery car crash near Kalama, Washington in 1991. The Washington state patrol is still trying to find her identity.  In this piece I profiled about 20 women who could be Helen Doe. This story as well as possible matches, can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/lo154i/extensive_write_up_on_the_bizarre_case_of_helen/)

Over 50 people are missing from the Yakama Indian Reservation. A long form write up on 30 women missing from the Yakama Nation as well as a similar write up on missing men can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/htvnv6/extensive_write_up_on_missing_and_murdered/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/l36nnm/gary_leon_ridgway_confessed_to_71_murders_but_was/) These pieces may be out of date. For example some John Does on the reservation were recently identified as men who were previosuly missing. And some people who previously had no Charley Project or Doe Network pages, now do, so keep that in mind as you read.

My write ups on Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, can be found [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/gpbcll/what_everyone_has_wrong_about_ridgway_extensive/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/gpbiav/what_everyone_has_wrong_about_ridgway_extensive/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/l36nnm/gary_leon_ridgway_confessed_to_71_murders_but_was/) Several victims of Ridgway were Native American such as Carol Chistensen who was of blackfoot descent, Kimi Kai Pitsor who was Native Hawaiian descent, and Patricia Yellow Robe who was from the Rocky Boys Indian reservation in Montana. Contrary to popular belief, The Green River investigation is still active.

Carlota Sanchez, 12, and Elsie Luscier, 13, were cousins who went missing in 1979 from the Quinault Indian reservation. I am currently working on a piece regarding their cases so stay tuned.

459,Benend91,[],1638033085,"Hi everyone,


Hopefully this case is allowed on this subreddit. I know it's UFO-focused but it's grounded in some actual evidence. Also as somebody who lives 10 miles away from the scene and had never heard about it, I wondered whether it had been discussed much before. A search through Reddit only produces a handful of results and none on this forum.


**What is the Pentyrch Incident?**

The Pentyrch Incident is an alleged UFO sighting that happened in a small village outside of Cardiff, Wales in 2016.


**What allegedly happened?**

Multiple witnesses reported a loud apache-type helicopter flying over the area, multiple unusual lights in the sky and a large explosion at around 4am. Social media posts and phone calls to local police provide a wide array of people who experienced this phenomenon.

A local woman, Caz Clarke, went further and claims to have seen a triangular UFO being chased around the sky by multiple military planes. On the next day, at the end of a field, a large patch of grass and bush was left completely dead and with abnormal levels of radiation. And in the following weeks army personnel were seen at the site, claiming to be there for a routine training operation.


**Why is this a mystery worth exploring?**

Through testimonials from multiple witnesses and seismology reports at the time, there *was* an unusual disturbance that evening. 

Intriguingly the RAF do not deny their presence there and they claim that the lights/sounds and explosion were all part of a routine op. Many people have tried to gain more information about the op using the Freedom of Information act but this has been blocked as the information is deemed to be important for national security.

Also, although there is a MOD site at nearby St Athan, locals are familiar with the sounds of the smaller aircraft and all have said that this was unlike anything they've experienced.


I'm not a UFO conspiracist and I would usually find a way to pick holes in a story like this but Caz Clarke is very convincing. In addition to the actual physical evidence in the surrounding area, it seems something DID happen that evening. 

Was it a training drill? Perhaps it went wrong and that's why the aircraft were flying so low? Or was it something else?

On September 23rd, 2012, the house the children lived in caught on fire. The remains of Leon and Molli McClaran were discovered deceased inside the house. The dog and the bird were also found dead. However, no trace of either Chloie or Gage was found. The police who investigated the scene believe that the children died in the fire, but forensic anthropologist say that nothing points towards that. Some remains of the children should have been discovered if they had died in the house. Inorder for the children's remains to have been cremated, the fire would have had to reach over 1500 degrees. It's very unlikely that the fire reached that temperature, according to fire experts.

The fire has been declared accidental, but the exact cause is not known. There were over 30 propane tanks in the basement, and authorities say some of the tanks had ruptured. However, there's no sign of explosion.

In 2013, a witness saw a young girl who looked like Chloie at a restaurant. The witness took a photo of the girl, and Chloies mother is sure that the girl in the photo is her daughter. The authorities were not able to determine the identity of the girl in the photo.

461,SleepawayCamp,[],1638016335,"""Theresa resided with her family in Fresno, California in 1987. She was last seen at 7:20 p.m. on June 1, 1987, while on a camping trip with Russell Welch in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Theresa and Welch,  whose nickname is Skip, camped in the area of Shuteye Peak, approximately 25 miles northeast of Bass Lake. He was 43 years old at  the time. They were reportedly searching for the legendary creature  known as Sasquatch or Bigfoot. Welch considered himself a ""student"" of the legend. Theresa disappeared during the trip and has never been heard from again.

Authorities questioned Welch when he returned to Fresno several days  later. He initially claimed that Theresa ran away from him on June 1,  then he changed his story. Welch eventually stated that Theresa had been  forcibly taken by Bigfoot.

Welch was charged with child stealing. In September 1987, only three  days before he was supposed to go to trial, authorities dropped the  charge. They had offered to recommend a one-year sentence if Welch  signed a waiver allowing them to go forward with murder charges if  Theresa's body were located, but Welch refused. The prosecution decided  to drop the case to avoid double jeopardy if they wanted to charge him  with murder later.

Searches of the Shuteye Peak area produced no clues as to Theresa's  whereabouts, but foul play is suspected in her case. It remains  unsolved."" [Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/theresa-ann-bier)

Many of you are thinking why would a parent/s allow their under age daughter to go camping with a middle-aged man? According to this lengthy, but very informative article, Theresa and her sister didn't have the best home life. A few years back, I read a comment left under a article on Theresa that stated she was her twin sister. This could be Vicki who is referenced below. I cannot find this page, so take that with a grain of salt. This case is ice cold and all involved failed this young lady.

""Theresa was born on April 16, 1971 to Shirley and David Bier. Shirley had a mental illness and David had been in the Vietnam War. When Theresa was about three years old, she was severely injured, ending up in the hospital. Shirley wrapped Theresa’s leg around the crib slats and twisted until it broke. She also beat Theresa, breaking several ribs.  At this point, Social Services intervened and took Theresa and her sisters away. This was also when Theresa's parents split up. Theresa was placed foster care and Sylvia Pierce, a friend from church, took in Theresa and her sister Vicki. Theresa lived happily with Sylvia for a few years, until her father wanted her back.

David had  married Margie Richmond, who had daughters of her own and had once been  married to Shirley’s half-brother, John Richmond. David petitioned the court to get his little girls back and was awarded custody. Theresa and Vicki became reunited with their father, moving to Southern California where both he and Margie worked as janitors. Allegedly, Margie would lock her refrigerator and just sit there and eat her lunch and not feed her kids anything.

Theresa eventually returned to Fresno and stayed with her great-grandmother for a little while with Theresa’s uncle, John Richmond, who also lived in Fresno. He was well known to Fresno law enforcement. Cops knew him as “*Blind Johnny.”* He fenced stolen property. And he actively began to pursued custody of his niece. John had two young sons when he took in Theresa. His new wife and presumably the mother of these young sons was reportedly a prostitute. He also had  a 17-year-old girlfriend, Tammy, who often stayed over at his place.

Theresa became very, very withdrawn. She  would stay in her room and keep to herself. Johnny would make Theresa babysit his little boys, often causing her to miss school. They lived in a filthy apartment. At one point Johnny’s wife took Theresa to Southern  California with the boys where she turned tricks while Theresa watched the kids. Johnny began molesting and raping Theresa and would let his friends do the same.

In June 1987, Theresa had nearly completed her freshman year at Central High in northwest Fresno. At  age  16 she was a year or more older than most of her classmates. Teachers saw Theresa as slow and immature and was placed in special education classes. 

A man named Russell *“Skip”* Welch  pretended to take Theresa to school, but both Skip and Theresa had other plans. They decided to go on a camping trip in the Sierra Nevada mountains and look for[ ](http://darkmatter69.blogspot.com/2018/06/things-you-need-to-know-about-big-foot.html)Bigfoot around the Bass Lake area.

Skip was a 43 years old meth addict. He was obsessed with Bigfoot and would often take girls into the  mountains. Before Theresa went on the camping trip with Skip, Skip had taken a young girl named Michelle on a previous trip. She was warned by friends not to go with him, but she did anyway. Michelle was smart enough to bring two big male friends with her. It's a good thing too,  because Michelle thinks she was drugged. She was screaming that someone  was going to kill her and almost fell off a cliff, but one of her friends saved her.

By mid-morning, the school called Johnny  to inform him that Theresa was not at school. He told them she was home sick. He would later explain that he lied because he preferred to handle the matter on his own.

Before they headed to the mountains, Skip and Theresa made a stop at his daughter, Chandra Welch's, place. Skip was having trouble with his beat-up, 1976 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. 

At 9:30 p.m., when Theresa still wasn't home, John finally called the Fresno police to report her missing.

On Friday, June 5th, Skip’s car was spotted parked by a trailer park near the town of North Fork, a small  foothills community that serves as a kind of gateway to the Shuteye Peak region of Sierra National Forest. Skip had driven down from the mountains to the residence of his friend, Dorothy Davis, who lived right behind that trailer park. Days later, Dorothy told authorities that Skip was extremely upset and possibly high on something when he showed up. He told her about a girl that he had left up in the mountains. A satanic group had gotten control of the girl and had physically changed into something all *“white looking.”*

A week after Theresa was reported missing, John received a threatening phone call from a young female. She  told him that Skip was packing a pistol and wanted her to tell him *“if you continue to make trouble for him, you will have more trouble from him, even your kids can get hurt.* And *“tell the police that Skip had taken Theresa to school, dropped her off, and some unknown blond girl had picked Theresa up.”*

Two days later, Skip was picked up by police at his mother's house in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Fresno. He claimed that he had dropped Theresa off at school, but the police weren't buying it and he was arrested. 

Back at the police station, Skip claimed that Theresa ran away from him on June 1st, but eventually  stated that Theresa had been forcibly taken by Bigfoot. He said that  she would be happier there, because they were super intelligent  beings... 

Skip agreed to show authorities where the campsite that he and Theresa allegedly stayed at. He led them to a small grove of trees at the meadow’s edge along Brown's Creek. At the inner area of this grove there was a smoldering fire among the heavy layer of pine needles that appeared to be somewhat damp. This smoldering burnt area was approximately 3½ feet wide by 8 feet long.  There were these blankets that were put up, and they were in a certain formation. There was a camera, a purse, a off-white bra and a T-shirt,  pictures of the  countryside, along with a picture of Welch playing guitar as he was sitting by what appeared to be the blanket that was in the grove area. There were also pictures of Theresa.

The campsite where all this was found,  turned out to be staged by Skip. From the topography in the photos, the local deputies were able to guess that the actual camp was 20 miles away, possibly in Ghost Canyon. Even though he allegedly lied about the campsite, both the meadow and the Canyon were searched.

A helicopter that was searching for any clue or sign of Theresa's whereabouts spotted something on the hillside above the Brown’s Creek camp. It turned out to be a blue shirt that belonged to Skip and it had meth in the pocket.

One of Skip's relatives told authorities that Skip had told them about a rock at Ghost Canyon where a girl needed to be tied up as a sacrifice to the devil....

Skip was charged with Theresa's abduction, but the case against him was dismissed due to a lack of evidence in October 1987. He was also offered a deal for an extremely light sentence, if he were to confess and show them wear her body was. He refused, sticking to his Bigfoot story.

Searches of the Shuteye Peak area produced no clues as to her whereabouts.

**Theresa has never been found. Foul play is suspected in her case.**

Theresa  was 5'5 ft tall and 110 lbs at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans and laced sandals. She had brown hair, hazel eyes. Theresa's upper front teeth protrude. She has a  surgical scar on her lower right leg due to a childhood fracture. Her nickname is Sam.

In March 1998, Skip died at age 54, from severe coronary artery disease.""

New Hampshire unsolved case file: Who killed Louise Chaput? 

In 2001 Canadian hiker coming to an area of New Hampshire where she often hiked. She arrived late in the day, around 3pm. And thought she would get in a short hike before sunset. 

She had reserved a room at the Appalachian Mountain Club Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch, New Hampshire. When she arrived, she asked an AMC worker at the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center where she could take a short hike that would get her back before dusk. 

The clerk suggested a short walk around Lost Pond Trail, which began right across the street from the lodge. She never returned to the lodge. 

She was as last seen on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2001. When she failed to return home the following Monday, friends and family called police and she was reported missing on Tuesday Nov 20, 2001.

464,SnoopyDog21109,[],1637982245,"Edward and Stephania Andrews lived in the affluent Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. Edward was a semi-retired manager and bookkeeper at Miller-Peerless Mfg. Stephania was a credit investigator for Local Loan Co. They were both aged 62 and had plans to retire at the end of 1970. This marriage was not the first for either Edward or Stephania. Although they had no children together, Edward had two children that he adopted with a former spouse.

The couple attended a cocktail party at the Sheraton-Chicago Hotel in Chicago, IL on May 15, 1970.  The party was sponsored by the Women's Auxiliary of the Beverage Institute, of which Stephania was a member. They arrived at the party between 5:30 and 6 p.m., and left around 9:30 p.m., taking an elevator to the hotel garage. Edward reportedly had been complaining that he felt ill and was hungry (the party had appetizers, but no meal). Friends that had lunch with Edward earlier that day said that he turned pale during lunch and couldn't eat. Was he suffering from some medical condition as early as lunchtime?

The last person to see the couple was Anthony Morelli, the parking manager for the hotel. He claimed that Edward was staggering when he walked to his car and that he hit the garage exit door while attempting to exit the garage. Morelli told Edward that he shouldn't be driving. A tearful Stephania agreed with him. Edward refused to listen and drove away in their black and yellow 1969 Oldsmobile sports coupe with the Illinois license plate number BB9986. They turned out of the hotel garage onto lower Michigan Ave. There are differing accounts of Edward either turning north into the southbound lane, or south into the northbound lane when he exited the parking garage.

The party was on a Friday. The couple wasn't reported missing until the following Monday when co-workers were concerned that Edward and Stephania hadn't shown up to their respective jobs. A neighbor who had a key to their home let the police in to search the house. Everything appeared orderly and there were no signs of foul play. Their clothes and suitcases seemed to all still be in the house.

Investigators theorized that Edward turned the wrong way into oncoming traffic when he left the hotel parking garage, and tried to make a U-turn when he realized that he was going the wrong way. The Chicago River had an area close to the hotel that wasn't protected by a guard rail. Police believe that Edward and Stephania's car plunged into the river. They found a place on a bridge on Lower Wacker Drive where there were scrapes on a concrete pillar and skid marks on the road. Numerous searches of the river have been made. Although other vehicles have turned up during the searches, the Andrews' Oldsmobile has not been located. 

In 1994, Lake County law enforcement received a tip that Edward and Stephania were killed and buried with their car in a pond near Green Oaks. The crime was supposedly committed by a gang known as the Lake Forest Losers. A Knollwood man came forward with a story that when he was 12 or 13, he witnessed the Losers dump a car with the Andrews' bodies in the trunk in a retention pond south of Atkinson Road and east of the Tri-State Tollway near Green Oaks. A search of the pond failed to turn up any additional evidence of what happened to Edward and Stephania. 

The most obvious solution seems to be that Edward drank too much at the party and/or had a medical incident, took a wrong turn when exiting the parking garage, and ended up plunging the car into the Chicago River. Law enforcement has dragged the river several times. During a search of the river in 1980, twelve cars were located, but none were the missing Oldsmobile. Where did the couple disappear to on that fateful spring night?

He was reported to be a well-known and well-liked young man who had grown up in Moston. He attended the North Manchester School for Boys and was a huge fan of his football team: Manchester United. He stood at 5'5"" (1.65m) tall, roughly medium build, and had ginger hair with brown eyes. 

On August 31, 2008, Jordan was with his Aunt Kimberley Pierce. Jordan had lived with his aunt since he was only 20 months old, but things were changing at his Aunt's home. Pierce was in the process of moving Jordan's grandfather into their home, as he had recently become ill and required a caregiver. Pierce was to be that caregiver.  Jordan had planned to spend some time at a hostel in Manchester while his aunt cared for his grandfather. The [Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/jordan-ratcliffe-missing-police-search-15094325) reports, ""\[I\] think he was a bit of a troubled teenager who had gone to stay in this hostel because his grandad was not in good health with all of the intentions of moving back home."" 

At about 16:45 that evening, his aunt and her boyfriend dropped Jordan off in Tib Street in the Northern Quarter. He wore a black and grey jacket, black Nike tracksuit bottoms, and black trainers (tennis shoes). Jordan was traveling light; he only had a small black rucksack, a package of crisps, and £5 in cash. 

""Call me when you get yourself settled,"" Aunt Kimberly Pierce had said as he exited the vehicle.  

Jordan waved goodbye to his aunt with a smile, heading in the direction of the hostel he was to stay at, Men's Direct Hostel in Longsight. He never arrived. 

Because Pierce had not expected to hear from Jordan immediately, she didn't panic when she failed to hear from him that evening. Days passed without word, and by September 8th, the family had notified Manchester Police of the missing teen. 

Julie Potts of the Greater Manchester Police's Missing Person Unit has been working on the case since its initial report. In the decades since Jordan's disappearance, Potts has carried out numerous checks to try and trace the teen. [She states](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/jordan-ratcliffe-missing-10-years-15091374), ""He has been gone for ten years and I will guess everyone knows that. The £20,000 reward is still out there. But there are no other lines of inquiry and Kimberly knows that well. She just wants Jordan to know that if he wants to come home then he can come home."" He could not be spotted on CCTV within the city center because of the gap between his last sighting on Tib Street and when he was reported missing. 

In 2010, a British Transport Police PSCO stopped a young man that matched Jordan's appearance in Waterloo Station. Before letting the person go, the young man told the officer that he was from Manchester. This sighting would generate many inquiries in the London area amid concerns that Jordan was perhaps homeless and living in the area. 

In 2012, Jordan was reportedly sighted in Liverpool, which was later discounted by police. In 2014, there were more reported sightings of Jordan in Portsmouth. Police visited the area, and although initial optimism was held by the force, the team was unable to find anything further. Then, in April 2017, the Piccadilly Basin was drained as part of the hunt for Jordan. The North West Police Underwater Search and Marine Unit searched the canal shallows but found no evidence of Jordan. 

As of writing this, there have been no further discoveries or movement on Jordan Ratcliffe's case. Jordan's aunt has never moved from her house in hopes that if he were to return, he would know where she is. Best said by his aunt, Kimberly Pierce, ""Sometimes the smallest fragment of information can lead to important new lines of inquiry. As the years pass, memories fade. But we will never forget Jordan or give up the search for him.""

Where is Jordan?"
466,Environmental_War_62,[],1637958408,"Hi, a few weeks ago I posted a local case that got some attention, so I decided to also share this one. This is a more recent mystery that I have always found disturbing, so here it goes. This also takes place in Quito, Ecuador's capital. The case is somewhat convoluted, I made my best to break it into parts. 

**David Romo**

David Romo was a 21 year old student, he lived with his mother Alexandra Córdova (his parents are divorced) and attended Universidad Central, he was studying social communication. David is described as a very sensitive and friendly person.  

**Thursday 16, 2013**

According to everyone in his life, friends, classmates, teachers and family, this was a seemingly normal day for David and he behaved as usual, there was nothing off about him that day. He went to University, after classes he hanged out with some friends, had some drinks with them and then headed home. As always, he took a bus. 

**The call** 

At around 22:22 p.m David called his mother, now this wasn't unusual, since he would always let her know when he was getting close to the station and she would pick him up. However, on this occasion, Alexandra claims her son sounded anxious and was speaking in a very low voice, almost whispering. He told her  that there were two men with him in the bus, he said they looked like cops and that they wanted to take him off the bus, he didn't elaborate much more. The last thing David said to her was: ''We're getting close.'', then he hang up. Worried, Alexandra went to the station as soon as she could and waited for him, but David never arrived. The family contacted his friends and girlfriend but none had heard from him since that night. His mother then reported him as missing. 

**The investigation**

The initial investigation managed to identify the exact bus David took that night and focused on three main suspects: the bus driver, the bus counter (the person in charge of collecting the bus fee) and the bus counter's assistant. When questioned about that night, each suspect gave a different version. One claimed David was asleep, that they woke him up and he got off, other that David was never asleep and got off at a different bus stop. After some research, the police found David's cellphone in the bus counter's bother's house, when questioned, this man, referred as Edgar M., said he had ''found'' the cellphone in the bus and gave it to his brother. Edgar M. was then convicted for theft and served one year in prison. In all the articles I read, there is no mention as whether any of these men ever mentioned the two supposed cops. I didn't find any reference to there being any more passengers that night either. Searches were carried out in the areas near the bus route but they came up empty. 

**The Union and Hope ''Clinic''**  

In November of that same year the police raided a clandestine clinic in Pisulí. I'm not very familiar with that part of town, but apparently the area was part of the route the bus was supposed to follow the night David disappeared. Anyways, police said they had received a tip, saying David Romo was or had been in that ''clinic''. This place operated as some kind of rehabilitation center for alcohol and drugs addicts as well as a camal (a place where animals are killed and cut up, more or less like a butcher shop). Seventeen people were being held there and many claimed they were electrocuted, starved and forced to work in the camal as a form of ''therapy''. One person, named Juan Francsico E.  claimed to have seen David inside the clinic. The clinic's owners, Carlos Lodoño, his wife Blanca, a colombian man named Arvey Acevedo (a.k.a Jaleo) and at least two other people were arrested in connection to the disappearance of David but also faced charges related to human trafficking and other offences. One news article mentions that ''a female worker for the justice system'' with ties to the ''clinic'' had also been apprehended but I couldn't find more details about this person. 

Based on Juan Francisco's testimony, those five people were charged with David's murder. According to Juan Francisco and the prosecution, David was brought to the clinic, during a search some drugs were found under his bed, he was then beat up and Jaleo killed with an axe. His body then was dismembered and burned with a blowtorch until there was nothing left. However, it is worth mentioning that Juan Francisco has changed his story multiple times, at first he said he had seen David but didn't mention any murder and at some point even recanted all of what he had said. Besides his testimony, no physical evidence linking David and the ''clinic'' has been found. On August 23, 2018 all the defendants were acquitted from the charges relating to David Romo. Jaleo, however, was convicted for the murder of one of the ''clinic's'' ''patients'' and received 22 years. In 2017, it was reported police members from the police unit in Pisulí were being investigated, allegedly they were aware of the ''clinics'' existence, its activities but didn't take action.  I couldn't find what the result of this investigation was. 

As of today, the case is considered open and has been assigned a new prosecutor. This prosecutor ordered new searches in April of this year, but again, nothing was found and Alexandra complained these searches were carried out in the same areas the first investigation had looked into. 

**Aftermath** 

Alexandra Córdova funded the David Romo Foundation, which is aimed to provide support and resources to the family of missing people. She also has a twitter account where she constantly posts about any update about her son's case. Since the beginning, Alexandra has complained about police's work, citing the fact that they have never tried to track down David's last call. She has said she believes police is somehow involved in David's disappearance, when she and her lawyer requested the initial prosecutor and detectives be investigated, the judge looking into this petition received some threatening messages. Finally, she says she doesn't believe Juan Francisco's story, saying her son never had any issues with drugs. 

The identity of the two mysterious men David claimed to see in the bus that day have never been discovered. I personally find it very odd, if they were cops, what were they doing in a bus? Anyways, this is the case that made me wary of taking a bus late and hope you find it interesting.

On a side note, what are everyone’s thoughts about the DB Cooper case? It’s such a crazy story, I came across it recently and I just can’t believe it happens. Crazy dude really just hijacked a plane, got an insane amount from the government, and disappeared.

Does anyone have any theories? I don’t really want to believe the one where he didn’t survive the jump- that’s no fun. Plus, i dont believe that they wouldn’t have found clues there. I think he must have been really amazing at organizing the heist and he just happened to get away.

On a side note, it’s kind of funny to see all the people who claim they’re DB Cooper. Ppl want to claim that they’re him for publicity I guess, but it doesn’t really make that much sense as to why they would say it lol.

468,Omenasose,[],1637917575,"I meant to cover only the first case and quickly found more. Tried to translate and summarize it because sources are only in German. 

Her thigh bone was already found in July 2020 by a forest worker in a forest near Kipfenberg (near Nuremberg, opposite direction of her hometown) in Bavaria, Germany. Thanks to DNA testing it was confirmed that it was a missing woman from Germany. Police keeps searching the area for more bones. 
The motorway that goes from Munich to Nuremberg is only 1.5km away. 
Sonja Engelbrecht from the city of Laim (south of Munich) went missing on April 11, 1995. Before that she went to a restaurant called Zum Vollmond in Schleißheimer Straße 82 with a two years younger male friend and went later to a party in Schellingstraße where they met two other friends of him. 
After the party the two left around 2am. She had to pee outside and made a remark about how she felt watched. 
She tried calling her sister while he left by Tram a bit later. 
Sonja‘s sister never received a phone call. Which would have been unusual for her anyway. There are doubts, Sonja ever went to Stieglmaierplatz. There would have been phone booths and tramstations already earlier, so they wouldn’t have needed going that far. 
Her parents never believed the story while police is sure about the events. 
Money has been lost to people who claimed knowing something about the missing daughter. 
The case was even shown in a TV show about unsolved crimes and several women called, stating a man tried to talking to them in that night in the area. 
It’s still a mystery what happened in that night. 

Police thinks there is maybe a serial murder because in 1991 a 28 year old woman called Kristin Harder from Munich disappeared in that area after a night out where she met someone new. After hanging out for a while, she moved on alone which no one could confirm. She went missing after that. 
In April 1992 on of her legs was found, previously frozen. In summer on of her arms was found, also previously frozen. A bit later an anonymous woman called the police, claiming to know the house where the woman was killed, but she never bothered telling an actual address or place. 
For a long time police considered the man she was with, was a suspect because he lied about knowing her. His sister also stated that a chain saw went missing from his garage. But a hair that was found in a trashbag containing the woman‘s leg, was not his. 

Bettina Treibhardt from Munich went also missing in 1997. The 45 year old woman was about to go out and was wearing an apparently too posh outfit for visit at a beergarden. She called a friend, leaving a  message suggesting to go there. But wasn’t at home anymore when he called back. Her remains are missing to this day. 

What do you think happened? Was there a mysterious stranger who preyed on women? It doesn’t say anywhere but maybe they were a bit tipsy, being an easy target for a lowlife.

I remember her husband would call her often at work. Apparently these calla consisted of him threatening her. It was obvious to everyone around her that her various injuries were connected to him and that he was a sadist.

Three people have been charged with the murder of a schoolgirl in Scotland 25 years ago.

Caroline Glachan, 14, from Bonhill, was last seen at about 12.15am on Sunday 25 August 1996, when she walked down Dillichip Loan towards Dillichip Bridge, in West Dunbartonshire, before then going on to a towpath.

Her body was discovered at about 4.10pm later that day in the River Leven, about a mile from her home and on what was her mother Margaret McKeich's 40th birthday.

Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Grainger, of Police Scotland's Major Investigations Teams, has now said they arrested and charged two men and a woman in connection with the death.

He said: ""I would like to thank the members of the public who have assisted with our investigation and those who have come forward with important information surrounding Caroline's death.""

Having attended the same school as Caroline and taught by the same teachers this has always been a haunting case for everyone in the area, I can only imagine how much more so for her loved ones.

I’m trying to find a mysterious disappearance/kidnapping I vaguely remember from years ago and my inability to find it is triggering me.

So I think it happened between the 50s and the 70s. Kid in question was chubby, I remember a black and white picture on which he was dressed in all white, with shorts.

He was on a trip with his parents in a RV (or a van?). A weird car was seemingly following them and eventually caused them to crash. Two strangers allegedly dressed in robes got out, took the kid and fled in the wilderness with him. Happened somewhere in Europe, either Germany or Spain. Kid was never seen nor found again. I think the parents survived the crash but like everything else about this I'm not sure.

Some details might not be 100% accurate, it’s been years since I last read of it. Does it ring any bell to anyone?

472,York_Street1,[],1637842847,"Last time I made a post about the infamous ""Pretzle man"" featured on Steely Dan's 3rd studio album, *Pretzel Logic*, I attracted a lot attention from many redditors. Many of them wondered who the man was in the [photo](https://www.rockshop.ro/images/product/216-steely-dan-pretzel-logic-cdjpg.jpg); many were hopeless, remarking that it was likely his name was lost to time; and others were incredibly helpful, providing source material and reposting my original post to other subreddits like users [u/AmusmentIsPending](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmusmentIsPending/) and [u](https://www.reddit.com/user/quinntronix/)/[quinntronix](https://www.reddit.com/user/quinntronix/). To put it simply, I *can* tell you that I have *not* found his name yet, *but* I *have* come across some new information as well as possible ways to identify this man that I would like to share with this subreddit.

In my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteelyDan/comments/qvi8os/who_is_the_pretzle_man_featured_on_steely_dans/) (you should go read it if you haven't), I wrote about a comment on an old forum that claimed the ""Pretzle man"" was, in fact, a real person and details about him could be found in a passage in a book called *Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years* by Brian Sweet. At the end of my post, I asked if anyone had access to this book and if they would be willing to share the pages with me.

And they did!

[u/AmusementIsPending](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmusementIsPending/) was so kind enough to not only confirm that this passage existed, but they sent me an electronic copy of the [page](https://postimg.cc/GHBBtR7Q)!

So this is the run-down story of what happened to the ""Pretzle man"" according to the novel:

Donald Fagen and Gary Katz (Steely Dan's producer at the time) thought it would be an interesting idea to take a photograph of a pretzel vendor in NYC's central park for the *Pretzel Logic* album cover. They hired Hollywood photographer, Ed Caraeff, to take the picture, but on the weekend of the shot he couldn't make it over to NYC in time. That's where Raeanne Rubenstein comes in. Because Ed Caraeff wasn't in NYC, Steely Dan called up Raeanne Rubenstein, an NYC photographer, and asked her to take the picture instead. So she went out into Central Park probably some time in early February, snap a picture of this man, and sent it back to Steely Dan.

And here's the crazy bit.

ABC records, the record company that Steely Dan was working for at the time, asked this man to sign a release form for the photograph... and he said no! *What a major dude! Who would have the guts to stand up to a major record company like that?* Anyway, so how did the picture end up on the album cover? Well, apparently, ABC records did a profile on this guy and found out he didn't have a license to sell pretzels, so he wasn't in a legal position to argue. So they slapped his face on the album cover anyway!

Dude... *who knew that a little picture would have such an intricate back story??? Also... this sounds really illegal; I think ABC records has some explaining to do.*

Okay, so this story answers a lot of questions from my previous post... but creates a million more: What does ABC records know who this guy is? Does Ed Caraeff know who this guy is? When was this picture taken? And where do we go from here?

Well, I've put together some possible ways that I think we can use to find this man and hopefully end this mystery:

1. **Witness-** I think this is probably the most obvious one: why don't we just ask someone who was there at the creation of the album cover?The best someone we could ask is ABC records because according to the novel they actually ran a background check on this guy; it's totally plausible that they still have this guy's profile collecting dust in a box somewhere. But we shouldn't exclude people like Donald Fagen, Gary Katz (producer), Ed Caraeff (photographer), Denny Dias (band member), Jim Hodder (band member), and Jeff Baxtar (band member) because it's likely that they know who this man is. I also think that Brian Sweet is a person we would need to be asked, too, because I'm not exactly sure where he got this information for his book (anyone who has the book, could you check the sources? Maybe there is a paper trail we can follow). And sadly, we cannot ask Raeanne Rubenstein because she pasted away a couple of years ago :'(.Yeah, honestly I think this is probably the best way to get information on this guy.
2. **Permit Archives-** Even though the ""Pretzle man"" did not have a permit to sell pretzels according to the book, it may not totally be a loss cause to look through permit records. Tell me this, if you had just been written off by a major record company because you didn't have a permit to sell pretzels, and now your face is on an album cover that you never wanted to be on, wouldn't you get a permit? I'm sure that somewhere the NYCPL or LOC have permit archives dating back to the 1970s that could possibly contain our ""Pretzle man.""
3. **Photo Archives-** It could be a long shot, why not look through photos of NYC during the 70s? Maybe the ""Pretzle man"" is hiding in one of the photos in the background, and there is a valuable clue in the image.
4. **Meme Strats-** Okay, this is kind of a goofy one, but why don't we turn this guy into a giant meme? If this guy became a giant meme and everyone was talking about him. Someone could be scrolling through their Facebook feed one day, see a meme about this man, have a revelation, and say, ""Hey, isn't that my uncle Peter?"" I don't know, it could work ;P

Well, I think I'm going to end it here; I've been typing for a while now and my fingers hurt, lol.

I'm sorry if I bored the subreddit with my sea of words 😂 If this topic really interests people, I can make a discord server if you'd like.

So long! Comment if you have any questions, sources, or revelations about the ""Pretzle man"" ;)

Victoria Police has charged a 55 year old Jetstar Airways pilot, Greg Lynn, with the murders of missing campers, Russell Hill and Carol Clay, who disappeared March 2020 in the remote Wonnangatta Valley in Victoria, Australia. 

The bodies of Russell Hill, aged 74, and Carol Clay, 73, are yet to be recovered.

Greg Lynn is expected to face Sale Magistrate Court on Friday. 

Victoria Police are seeking a trailer they believed was towed by Lynn at the time of the murders that is unaccounted for. It is believed he may have sold the trailer in the months after the murders on the online marketplace, Gumtree.

The investigation was especially difficult because of the remoteness of the area where the pair vanished. 

The couples burnt out campsite was found several days after the Hill and Clay was last heard from on March, 20. Hill’s four-wheel drive was still at the campsite but with no sign of either of them.","Police charge man, Greg Lynn, with two counts of murder in relation to missing campers, Russell Hill and Carol Clay."

475,msnewman,[],1637810844,"So I have been looking at a cold case in my area and I have kind of hit a wall on digging up more information. I submitted a public records request but the police department is not releasing anything stating that it is an ongoing investigation although it has been cold for quite some time. Veronica James was 25 years old when her body was found inside of a canvas duffle bag in the driveway of an abandoned home in Portland, OR. I have heard that she was killed by blunt force trauma to the head and I have heard another story that she was shot so I am not sure which one is accurate. She was last seen near the intersection of 82nd Ave. and Stark St. I did track down a comment from a bartender in the area that said that Veronica had come into the bar and seemed scared as if ""someone was chasing her"". She had 3 young daughters when she was killed and there are reports that she was allegedly involved in sex work and struggled with substance abuse issues. 

Past that, there really isn't much out there about her that I have been able to find. I know there are PLENTY of people here that are way better at research than me so I'm just hoping someone can turn up some more information and send it my way.

Sadly this case has little info available.

Orange Jane Doe was a teenager or young woman whose skeletal remains were recovered from an abandoned carriage house in 2019. In Orange , County New York.  She was believe to be in the age range of 14-20 years old, abd of African American ancestry.

She is believed to have been deceased between 6-11 years prior to her discovery.

Her cause of death was unable to be determined, owing to the state of her remains. However, due to a rope or a string found wrapped around her neck, strangulation is suspected and her death has been ruled a homicide.

477,afoolandhermonkey,[],1637779302,"I thought the recording of her fiancé’s call to 911 had never been released to the public, but I just heard it on this week’s episode of the podcast Music City 911 (great podcast from a former 911 dispatcher who analyzes real calls). It was apparently also on an episode of another podcast that I hate and will not name.

I’ve previously leaned toward the idea that this was a suicide, which I know is a a highly controversial opinion, but have never been fully convinced. At the very least, I believe this case needs a full and better investigation. The 911 immediately raised some red flags for me. I’m no expert but have always been under the impression that giving a long lead up to the reason for the call (rather than starting off with, “my fiancée is hurt”) can be suggestive of guilt. This is what he does during the call — it feels like he is establishing an alibi. It reminds me of Darlie Routier’s 911 call where she starts off saying “ someone came in here, they broke in” rather than saying immediately that her boys are dying.

I know this is a controversial and hotly debated case but I’m curious as to what others think about the Greenberg 911 call specifically. Does it make you lean one way or another in terms of a perpetrator or whether this was murder or suicide? Should it be taken into consideration when assessing whether her fiancé had a role in her death?

478,Emergency-Bus3617,[],1637758060,"Hello, this is a missing person case that has always intrigued me, partially because it is a case where a child disappears but isn't reported missing until two decades later. Clearly this is a very difficult case, in that no-one knows when or where Nikole disappeared so finding any leads is nigh on impossible.

*The facts*

There is a very nice article [here](https://medium.com/crimeatorium/out-of-sight-not-out-of-mind-the-tale-of-nikole-betterson-fc30b4ab7cfe)

, that I recommend reading to get an understanding of the full circumstances, but I will also summarize the facts below:

Jarrett (sometimes spelt Jarett? it might just be a typo) Betterson, born circa 1948 (said to be 49 in 1997) had a daughter, Nikole Betterson in 1975?, with Susan Klingel. This was a relationship disapproved by Susan's parents, either due to Jarrett's race or his drug use. Jarrett was black, Susan white, and Nikole therefore mixed race.

When Nikole was two, in 1977 Jarrett crashed the car he was driving. He and Nikole survived. Susan did not.

A few months later he met Barbara Saddler and started a relationshith her. IIn December 1977, together they left Michigan with Nikole in search of a new start. Barbara promised the Klingel's (Susan's parents) that she would take care of Nikole as her own daughter.

The Klingel's never saw their granddaughter again. In 1997, when Nikole would have been 22, they decided to try and get in touch with her, believing she was now old enough to make her own decision about whether or not she wanted a relationship with them. They hired a private detective, who swiftly found Barbara and Jarrett, now married, in poverty and ill health, in Las Vegas.

There was no sign of Nikole however.

The P.I. decided to bluff and told Jarrett he knew what had happened to Nikole and that he should just confess now. Jarrett said he needed a few days and then he would tell his side of the story. He never did, however, as he and Barbara committed suicide together shortly afterwards.

Barbara sent a note to Jarrett's mother Joni Betterson (who also hadn't seen the couple in 20 years). In it she said apologised and claimed that Jarrett was about to go to jail. No mention of Nikole was made.

Further investigation revealed that, the couple had continued cashing benefit checks for Nikole until she was 18. But no one had any memory of her living with the Bettersons. In fact, the police have stated that they don't have any evidence that she ever left Michigan.

For these reasons, most believe Nikole is dead. And has possibly been dead for 20 years before she was even reported missing.

*The search for Nikole*

I've looked at a few potential Does but none have really lept out at me as good possibilities. Since it is possible that Nikole died or was disposed of along their way to Las Vegas, I think it might be good to look at what states would be passed through. I'm non-US so I've had to rely on Google Maps routes and checking what roads existed in 1977, so I don't think I'm the best at that task.

Its also possible that they took a non-standard route to get to Las Vegas. The article linked above says that they told people different plans - ""Some say the couple mentioned moving to California, others have said Nevada."". They might have spent some or most of those 20 years AWOL in an unknown state. Theres no information (that I can find) on whether Jarrett and Barbara had friends or connections to other places that they might have gone to first.

In a [previous reddit write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4dyvuc/what_happened_to_nikole_betterson_why_has_she/), user cerebral\_\_flatulence mentioned in the comments that it would be helpful to ""know which cities Nikole's father picked up her benefits cheques as a way of tracking their route, cities and timeframe, too bad that information isn't listed. Perhaps this wasn't looked at or recorded or it is a complex paper trail that hasn't been investigated fully.""

I've been doing some myheritage record looking, so I decided to use the resources there to see if I could find anything useful.

I found Barbara and Jarrett' marriage certificate. It states that Jarrett James Betterson and Barbara Gaines Saddler (Betterson) married in Clark, Nevada, USA, on Aug 28 1982. This is helpful, in that we can say they had definitely reached Las Vegas by 1982. Since they left Michigan in December 1977, this means there are just 4 years unaccounted for in regards to what state they are in. It is less helpful in that, it does not actually help.

I also found some of their residences in Las Vegas. 2 have dates attached Apr 1 1992 and June 1 1994 (both E Mesquite Avenue, just different houses). 1 has no date attached (E Tonopah Ave). Myheritage has a system where it can show you neighbours of people in the address. I haven't looked into any of them, but I guess any investigative journalists would probably be trying to interview these people. Not sure if there's any hope of them remembering a couple from 20 years ago.

Confusingly I also found another marriage certificate. This is for a Jarrett J Betterson born circa 1946 age 22 marrying Linease Hayes (Betterson) born circa 1949 age 19 in Los Angeles, California, USA in Jan 4 1968. The birth date of Jarrett is different, and I don't know why he'd be in LA but the name is very close to our Jarrett James Betterson. I can find the yearbook of a Linease Hayes studying at West High School (Denver, Colorado) in 1965. No Betterson in the year book though.

I also found a year book with a Barbara Saddler in 1969 as a junior at Midland High School (Midland, Michigan). Which was nice to see her face, but not helpful in the slightest.

*The weird thing*

There is a family tree (user created) which includes Jarrett J Betterson. The birth date given is different again 1945, but the death date is correct for our Jarrett 1997. The tree also has Susan Klingel on it. But she is described as his wife aka Susan Betterson (nee Klingel) despite them never marrying. Her death year is also correct 1977.

The user-submitted family tree also gives them a child. The child seems to be female by virtue of their name changing. There is no first name or confirmed gender as they are a private individual. They appear as &lt;Private&gt; Saxon (born Betterson) and are married to &lt;Private&gt; Saxon. They also appear to have a child (whose gender is alternatively presented as male or female on the site), who is named Taylor M\*\*\* (their full name is on the site but I wasn't sure if that is something I can share here)  and is in their 30's. Taylor is the site manager and therefore the one to create this family tree. There is no further information.

The existence of a female child to Jarrett and Susan, who lived to get married and have a kid seems pretty suspect to me. The slightly odd dates and the fact that Taylor has a completely different last name, also made me wonder if this is just a family tree made by someone interested in the disappearance. Not sure why they would do this though?

I also considered that maybe the mysterious child is a sibling of Nikole's. There is nothing to suggest that there was such a person, but I can imagine that's an easy fact to skip out on in an article if the person values their privacy. Seems odd though since the article states at the end that ""Lieutenant Peterson would like to get DNA from the Klingel’s so that if Nikole did show up, they could match it to her. As stated above, Susan’s father has passed, her mother Mary is still alive as are her two sisters."".

I have sent a very apologetic message via myheritage to Taylor M\*\*\* asking them if they were aware of Nikole's missing person case and if they knew DNA was being sought from a close relative. They haven't replied and they haven't been on site since 2016 it seems so I don't think they will ever. I feel very dubious about having sent the message in the first place, as this could be a very sensitive subject to them if they are a relative. And presumably they would already know about the case already, and be sick of question. So I'd ask that anyone else enacts a lot of caution about trying to find Taylor M\*\*\*. Which is hypocritical, but I didn't think I could write about them, without at least trying to ask them for their side of the story.

Any thoughts on anything? This is a case that I would really like to see solved. Susan's mother is still alive and Susan had several siblings - I'm sure they would like to know the fate of Nikole before they pass.

479,CrimesFromTheEast,[],1637704289,"In 2004, the German Handball Federation was excited to be hosting for the very first time, the Sri Lankan Handball team for a series of friendly matches between the 2 countries. These weren’t competitive matches but more of an exchange of skills &amp; the beginning of a mentorship between the 2 teams.

The Germans are credited for officially forming the sport in 1917 which is an Olympic sport so quite prestigious to be associated with a national team of the sport of course.

**The Warm Wittislingen Welcome!**

After a 10-hour flight you’d expect the Sri Lankan Team to be haggard and tired but they were delighted at having landed and had a spring in their step like explorers at a new frontier!

They were quickly put up at a hotel and were made comfortable by their German hosts who hosted a dinner in their honor. The teams got to meet each other &amp; they sang &amp; danced the night away. There were awkward gesturing and in broken words the people from these 2 countries who speak completely different languages tried to communicate. The taste of joy &amp; merriment hung in the air.

Over the next couple of days, the hosts took the team sight seeing all over the town where the Sri Lankans were introduced to the Mayor of Wittislingen.

Then came the day of their first friendly match! Right on time the Teams arrived &amp; after handshakes the referee blew on the whistle to kick off the match. It was an absolute disaster; the Sri Lankan team were playing at a level close to amateur. They were beaten effortlessly by the Germans. It was expected of the visiting team to not be of the same caliber as the home team but this was rather extreme, almost embarrassing to watch. A couple of the players certainly had some skill and were trying their best to save face but it is not a one-man sport after all and the weakness of the team was left exposed for the Germans to see.

No worries, another day another match, right? These losses would teach them valuable lessons and improve them.

After the disastrous game, the team again had a wonderful night of food, music &amp; dancing. The Sri Lankan players played drums and sang their local songs and also for some reason, a nearly unrecognizable rendition of Shaggy’s You’re my Angel.


**Going..going..gone?!**

It was day for Match #2 on September 13th 2004. Auxiliary members from the Bavarian Handball Team headed over to the hotel where the 23-member strong Sri Lankan Handball team was staying. 
Having agreed at a 7am breakfast, the German hosts waited another hour out of politeness but by 9am they were worried something may have happened to the Sri Lankan Team. 
They busted open the door to the large conference room where the team was put up, the mattresses lined up on the floor were slept in and disheveled as if left in a hurry. All the suitcases were still there, shoes, sports uniforms and gear were strewn about the room. Everything was there except the 23 men from the grand old isle of Sr Lanka!
Where had the team disappeared to? 

Worried that the men had probably gone out jogging in the woods &amp; gotten lost, the Bavarian hosts set out a search party to look for them. The Wittislingen police were notified as was the Sri Lankan Embassy in Germany.
Then someone took a closer look at the hotel room and found scrawled on a piece of paper, a strange note patched together with misspelt words which were straightforward, apologetic, grateful &amp; still somehow optimistic.

**The note** read..

*""For Every one, we want to say thank you. You are very friendly. We have decided to leave Germany &amp; travel to France. We want to find better further life. This is our own decision &amp; we will take full responsibility &amp; risk for our decision.*

*You all were very friendly &amp; nice to us. Please forgive us for our decision. We don’t have any other way right now. We cannot go back to Sri Lanka so we will go now. Please don’t worry about us we will be fine. You have done a lot for us &amp; we thank you all again."" With love, Manager (name signed)*

The entire convoy of 23 men had dispersed into Germany and could not be traced beyond the local train stations and cab stops. They had disappeared in search of a better life to alleviate themselves from the poverty &amp; civil war ridden existence back home.
The poor unsuspecting Germans were left in the lurch with broken dreams of mentoring a new team in their Home grown sport.
This whole shenanigan was nothing but a ruse right from the start!

As the Germans might say, ""Das ist das leben!"" That's life!

**Pregame Strategy**

This vanishing did not occur in a vacuum. You don’t just waltz into Europe from developing nations oh no this instance of illegal immigration was a carefully laid plan and took months to plan &amp; execute. 
The exchange program between the 2 countries was facilitated by an organization called the Asian-German Sports Exchange Program or AGSEP for short. It was started by Dietmar Doering a German transplant in Sri Lanka who came to the island nation on vacation in 1981 and fell in love making it his new home from then on.
Doering was an avid Table tennis player and started this exchange program with his home country and with the help of Sri Lanka’s government helped foster hundreds of friendly visits between the countries over various sports. Never handball though. There just wasn’t any interest in the sport in South Asia. Cricket &amp; Soccer reigned supreme in the hearts of all desi people then &amp; now.

Out of the blue, in 2003 Doering received a call from the Sri Lankan Sports ministry about inviting the German Handball team over for a friendly match. This was surprising because, Doering had never heard of a local team that played the sport. 

The ministry appointed a head coach Athula Wijenayaka who in a matter of weeks put together a rag tag group of men together as the official team.

The new head coach held practice sessions couple times a week and taught the bare minimum basics of Handball to the men. They were coached more on how to appear like they knew handball and posture as athletes. It worked because the German Team came &amp; with much fanfare an exhibition match was held. The home team was beat 2-36 which is quite atrocious but somehow, they still managed to get an invite to Germany to play matches there as is customary for the Exchange program.

And so, encouraged by yet another prospect for intercontinental harmony, Dietmar Doering committed himself &amp; the resources of his organization AGSEP into getting this trip to Germany underway. The biggest hurdle in the process was of course getting Visas from the German Embassy. 

Like I mentioned before, a brown person does not simply waltz into a non-brown country. The stamp of approval &amp; recommendation from a German national like Dietmar Doering &amp; his highly successful AGSEP foundation was a huge boost of confidence in the visa applications of these 23 men. They were soon approved &amp; the 2004 trip was planned to play 10 games over a period of 2 weeks in Wittislingen.

So these men not only bamboozled the Germans but also the AGSEP foundation &amp; the German embassy in Colombo too!
Doering suspects the head coach was mastermind behind the whole thing. However, if you think about it, there had to have been someone at the Sri Lankan Sports Ministry who either supported this plan or was hoodwinked themselves because the call to AGSEP had come from the ministry.

It’s unlikely these 23 men had the power or influence over ministers but it’s not entirely impossible. Sri Lanka is right below India on the global corruption Index charts at No. 99 out of 195 countries.

**Why though?**

On average each of those men had a family of 5 some up to 10 that they needed to support financially.
Civil war had torn the country apart &amp; limited the means of employment for many of these men. While they weren't exactly the poorest of the poor, they certainly were the brave ones who were game to risk their current freedom for future freedom.

The initial investigation had shown that most of the men had crossed into Italy.  
Why Italy? Well, there is a huge Sri Lankan population in Italy, nearly 100,000 strong!  A lot of the agricultural labor in Italy is South Asian. Some of these men had relatives already living in Italy so they just had to get there by hook or crook &amp; they would be Golden. 

The typical route from Sri Lanka to Italy would involve being locked up in a container on merchant ships for weeks, hoping to stay alive by the time to get there. 
In comparison, this handball con was like a luxury deluxe premium experience in the annals of illegal immigration yeah?

Some of these Handballers were eventually tracked down  &amp; surprisingly close to half of them had actually returned back to Sri Lanka but now had Italian Visas &amp; could easily go back when &amp; if they choose to. They revealed that they had paid around $4000 to be part of this team. That is a huge sum! 

In any case this incident marred the relationship between the 2 countries as far as the AGSEP exchange program went and no other teams were invited back since then. 

**Art imitates Life**

In 2008 a movie called Machan was made by an Italian director telling a slightly fictionalized tale of this con. 
In a fantastic twist, life imitated art when after shooting of Machan wrapped up in Germany, one of the Sri Lankan actors failed to show up at the airport &amp; illegally immigrated into Europe himself just like the characters they were playing!

In 2010 Sri Lanka finally debuted an actual legit officially stamped Handball Team at the South Asian Games in Bangladesh. No word on if they have ever faced the Germans again! The courts will be especially charged if they did or will in the future!
Game set Match!

480,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1637702903,"On the morning of November 25th, 1983, the day after Thanksgiving, 54-year-old Glendora Glenn went to check on her uncle, 70-year-old Theodore “Buster” Phillips Jr. at his Muncie, Indiana home located at 825 North Brady Street. Theodore had never married and had no children, however he maintained a close relationship with Glendora and his extended family. 

When Theodore failed to answer his phone that morning, Glendora worried he was possibly injured and quickly drove the few short blocks from her home to his. However once inside she made a startling discovery. Theodore lay dead on the kitchen floor, his body riddled with stab wounds. Glendora immediately summoned police. 

It was determined that Theodore had been stabbed 24 times with a large kitchen knife. His official cause of death was determined to be blood loss from a stab wound that directly hit his heart. However, Theodore was also stabbed and slashed multiple times in the chest, shoulder, neck, groin and leg, and had defensive wounds on his hands. The murder weapon, a knife from Theodore’s kitchen, was found next to his body. Nothing appeared to be missing and the home showed no signs of forced entry. 

Theodore was known to be particularly cautious when it came to strangers. His modest home on the dead end street was outfitted with bars on the windows and multiple locks on the doors. If someone he didn’t know knocked, he would only speak to them through the locked front door, and he never allowed strangers into his home. This detail combined with the fact police found no signs of forced entry, led investigators to believe Theodore was murdered by someone he knew. 

Several people were brought in for questioning, however after providing alibi’s and taking polygraph tests, they were released and the trail went cold. Article’s about the murder continued to be published often in the newspaper however, in the hopes that someone with information would come forward. 

Just over a month after Theodore’s murder, a leadership change at the Muncie Police Department occurred. In an article published in January 1984, the new leadership vowed to make Theodore’s case a “top priority.” However this was the last article published about Theodore’s case. The case was dropped from the headlines and wasn’t again mentioned publicly until 2016. 

In the 2016 article, it is revealed that further hindering the investigation is the fact that the location of the original case file is unknown. The department's investigative unit has moved several times since 1983, and Theodore’s case file was not found among others from the same time period. 

Theodore was a World War 2 veteran, and an extremely active member of his church, however he was best known for the 14 years he spent working as a chef for a local restaurant called The Highland Cafe. Thelma and John Bragg, the owners of the restaurant, even credited Theodore for the success their business saw. 

Sadly I believe that nothing short of a confession will solve this case. Glendora appears to be the only remaining relative of Theodore’s, and she is in her 90s. However, if you have ANY information about the murder of Theodore “Buster” Phillips Jr., please contact the Muncie Police Department at (765) 747-4867.

[Rachel Cyriacks](https://uncovered.com/cases/rachel-cyriacks) was a mother of two children from Mitchell, South Dakota and was well liked by her community. Her family described Rachel as a woman always on the go and as a daddy’s girl.  However, Rachel’s life was far from perfect. Around the time she met her husband, Brad Cyriacks, she started to experiment with drugs which eventually led to her struggling with addiction. 

In August 2013, Rachel filed a temporary restraining order against Brad. She was ready to take control and build a better life for her two children. The restraining order was later dropped as Rachel didn’t appear in court to extend the order of protection. According to paperwork, she was seeking a divorce as a result of ongoing domestic abuse but her husband was never contacted and the divorce filing was ultimately denied.

**The day Rachel went missing.** On November 11th, 2013, Rachel picked her husband, Brad, up from jail and took him home. However, it took multiple interviews before Brad mentioned this detail to officials.The following day on November 13th, 2013, Rachel was last seen in Mitchell, South Dakota at her job, Pet Performance. 

She has multiple tattoos on her body including a left neck tattoo of the name “Bradley” in black script. Rachel was last seen driving her silver and black 1995 Chevy Silverado truck with a South Dakota license plate 4CH634. [Rachel had a pink, tan and white quilt that she adored was also missing](https://uncovered.com/cases/rachel-cyriacks/timeline). Police believe that it was taken from Rachel’s home when she vanished.

**Rachel’s car is found.** On January 9th, 2014, Rachel’s damaged pickup truck was discovered by authorities with severe damage to the undercarriage. At this time, authorities believe that foul play is involved with Rachel’s disappearance.

On April 6th, 2014, Rachel’s home was vandalized. Nothing was stolen but a window was shattered, a table and light fixture was broken. There was also a message spray painted on the front of her home that read “riverside for life” and an expletive. Authorities are unsure if the spray painted message is connected to Rachel’s disappearance.

 By September 2015, the police searched for Rachel on the James River near the Huron, South Dakota area. On November 27th, 2016, police investigated a location in Beadle County with ground penetrating radar which is [“a geophysical technique that uses radar pusles to detect and image underground utilities.](https://tech27.com/resources/ground-penetrating-radar/)” This technology would allow authorities to determine if someone is buried in the ground. 

**Where the case stands today.** Law enforcement are still investigating any leads regarding Rachel’s case. The family has teamed up with a private investigator and created a Facebook page titled, “Help Find Rachel Cyriacks” and have not given up looking for Rachel. Could her disappearance be connected to the fallout of an unhappy marriage?

496,NinaSimonesGhost,[],1637592710,"Sorry in advance if this is already a theory that's gone around or if I've broken any rules of this subreddit (I didn't see any I might've broken, but who knows). I'm not usually into doing deep dives into unsolved mysteries or discussing them, and I do realize that this is a long shot. However, I went down a rabbit hole some time ago and ended up on \[this thread\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qmrcrm/comment/hjdbc8w/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qmrcrm/comment/hjdbc8w/)) discussing the disappearance of Teekah Lewis. I was interested, so I looked up more info, and it turns out that according to a witness's description of Teekah's probable kidnapper, his most notable characteristics were a heavily pockmarked face and long hair. I remember reading about Michaela Garecht's kidnapping some years ago, and one fact that stood out to me was that his most notable characteristics were also a heavily pockmarked face and long hair.  
From \[Wikipedia\]([https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance\_of\_Michaela\_Garecht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Michaela_Garecht)):  
\&gt; Rodriguez, the sole witness to the abduction, described Garecht's captor as a white male in his twenties. The most distinguishing characteristic was that he seemed to have severe acne or pockmarks on his face. He had shoulder length, dirty blonde hair. He was around 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 meters) in height and had a slender build. The witness described him as having fox-like, blue eyes and wearing a white T-shirt.   
From \[a local Washington news source\]([https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/teekah-lewis-21-years-later-witness-account-could-be-key-to-solving-case-of-missing-girl](https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/teekah-lewis-21-years-later-witness-account-could-be-key-to-solving-case-of-missing-girl)):  
\&gt; Det. Reopelle says the man they’re looking to identify is white, 5 feet 11 inches tall with a husky build. He’s described as having shoulder length curly brown hair with a thick mustache and a heavily pockmarked face.  
Both men are described as around the same height. In 1988, Michaela's kidnapper was described as being in his 20s. In 1999, Teekah's kidnapper was described as being in his 30s or possibly 40s. Though Miachaela's kidnapper is described as lean and Teekah's is described as husky, this would not be inconsistent with normal weight gain as one ages if they were the same person. Michaela's kidnapper had dirty blonde hair, and Teekah's had curly brown. I think given the fact that hair changes as one ages and can even look different from day-to-day and in the eye of the viewer, there is a possibility that the witnesses simply described the same hair differently. Both abductions took place on the West Coast. Both men worked alone, and both men took girls from public places with other people around and sped off in their cars, as if they didn't so much care about being seen but knew that working fast would diminish their chances of getting caught.   
I'm aware that David Misch has been charged with kidnapping and murdering Michaela. Not that I'm any kind of expert, but I'm not convinced he's the one who did it. In the current reports that compare Misch to Michaela's abductor, they leave out the fact that Misch doesn't have and never appears to have had a heavily pockmarked face, which was emphasized as a key characteristic of the abductor for many years. In fact, his skin is remarkably clear. The kidnapper was also described as having blue, fox-like eyes at the time of the abduction. Misch's eyes don't look blue to me (they look hazel or gray; someone can correct me if I'm off) and are decidedly not fox-like. Another thing: Misch's other victims were adult women. It's my understanding that serial rapists and killers usually (not always) stick to victims of similar types. While Michaela and Teekah may be of different ages and races, two vulnerable little girls are still more similar than the multiple mature/adult women that Fisch raped and/or murdered and one little girl. I also think it'possible that if the kidnapper is the same person, he may have switched to abducting black girls or girls of color because of how high-profile Michaela's disappearance was and how little attention cases involving black girls tend to receive. One last thing: the reported ""fingerprint"" used to connect Misch to Michaela is actually be a partial handprint that is so small it had to be compared manually because a computer database wouldn't accept it. Now, I'm not saying David Misch isn't a giant flaming turd who deserves to rot in jail forever, but I do think it's possible he's been fingered for a crime he didn't commit because he bore a passing resemblance to the one who did it when he was young and because he's already a violent criminal. It gives the family and investigators closure to convince themselves that they've captured the perpetrator, even if the evidence is shaky at best. But I think Michaela's kidnapper is still out there, even if my theory is silly and wrong.  
Maybe it's all just a coincidence and I'm being ridiculous, but I think it's worth asking what other people think. Again, I'm not in any way, shape, or form an expert or even skilled amateur when it comes to this stuff; I just think the (okay, admittedly weak) similarities between the two kidnappings are interesting. I'm especially interested in hearing from any folks who know more about either case and can give more details that could maybe point to a connection or that could rule it out.  
Thanks!",Is it possible there's a connection between the disappearances of Michaela Garecht and Teekah Lewis?

498,moondog151,[],1637589129,"(This is the last time I do a write up on this case. I've done it twice before but I wasn't satisfied as I left out a lot of information and I wasn't very good at it back then. Unless a new development is made I will not do another write up on this case)

When this case first began in 2008 Burkina Faso was led by a military dictator turned civilian president named Blaise Compaoré, Although the country was still poor and terrorism always a possibility in the small African nation they did have some degree of political stability despite Blaise's dictatorial reign. In 2014 after a series of demonstrations and uprising Blaise would be removed from power in 2020 which plunged the country into political instability during the aftermath. In April, 2021 Blaise was also indicted by a military court for the murder of the country's former president Thomas Sankara and for ordering the death a journalist but any trial will be conducted in absentia due to Blaise being living in exile in Côte d'Ivoire.

This case takes place in The Boulmiougou District of Burkina Faso's capital city Ouagadougou, Boulmiougou is also referred to as Sector 17. Boulmiougou is located on the western edge of the city and is semi-rural and densely populated with the district most well known for its reservoir. Most of Boulmiougou's residents work in markets, gardening, growing vegetables and salad greens on small plots.

This case sadly lacks a timeline or complete list of victims which means the circumstances of the crime and name of some of the victims are unable to be located online. What is known however is that this case starts in December, 2008 with the first murder but details about this murder are sadly unknown.

The MO for the crime is known however as the killer would target night watchman, guards or people sleeping in their homes and would kill them with the weapon not being the same every case with the murder weapons ranging from crowbars, cutters, pickaxes, axes, wood, iron bars or stones found off the ground but the ax and stones would be the most popular murder weapon utilized by the perpetrator or perpetrators. In order to taunt and confuse police/investigators the killer would also discard the murder weapons leaving them at the scene for the police to find. This is how the killer was nicknamed ""L'homme à la hache"" as an ax was the most common item found at the various murder scenes.

Although most victims sadly don't have their names or the circumstances of their crime known and accessible online that isn't the case for all of them as demonstrated by the following.

On August 5, 2009 a driver from Côte d'Ivoire named Adama Bandé was killed by an man with an ax that was stolen from a concession. The killer broke down the door to his home before butchering him with the ax in cold blood. Nothing was stolen from his body or his home although some of his possessions such as his driver's licence were found in his backyard. He was the 6th victim.

On October 2, 2010 Marcelline Kabré a 17 year old girl was found dead in her bedroom. Her skull was crushed with a large stone, she was raped (according to some sources) and her room was ransacked. Tragically she was sleeping next to her 6 year old niece Delphine who was not woken up by the killer.

On November 13, 2010 a man named Mahamadi Nikièma was returning home after praying at the local mosque when we was ambushed. He received three machete wounds to his arm and during the struggle he received a blow to his head and had his ribs broken but his cries alerted his neighbors causing the attacker to flee. The residents then rushed him to the hospital where thankfully he managed to recover becoming a survivor of ""L'homme à la hache"".

On January 4 or 5, 2011 A night watchman was found dead next to a mosque in a pool of his own blood and like the previous victims an ax was found next to his body and nothing appearing to have been stolen. The final victim count is thought to be 15 but the number or survivors who were merely injured by the killer's attacks is unknown.

Understandably these crimes created a panic in the district with many residents refusing to go outside at night and only accepting news interviews if kept anonymous. Many of the residents fear that these were ritual murders carried out by a single individual a hired assassin in fact looking to harvest and extract the organs of his victims in order to obtain wealth.

The official theory from the police however dismisses this explanation as none of the bodies actually had any organs removed. Rather they believe that the motive behind these murders were motivated by fetishism the African belief that certain special and significant objects hold some degree of supernatural power. The police also theorized that a gang of individuals were involved. They also believed that the gang were under the influence of narcotics spefically cocaine while committing the murders

Some murders were falsely attributed to this killer such as on September 3, 2009 when a woman was found lying dead in a pool of her own blood however the police soon arrested a 35 year old woman and a friend of the victim for the crime labelling it as unrelated to the ongoing serial killing case.

Many felt as if the police were not prioritizing the case because Boulmiougou/Sector 17 was a working class neighborhood with a student in the area saying “We have never heard that such crimes are committed in Ouaga 2000 or the 1,200 housing units. I assure you that if it was in a residential area, the murderer would have been under arrested a long time ago” and the father of Adama Bandé stated that the police and courts would never respond to his constant request for updates on the murder, He passed away on July 3, 2011. Other residents however claim that the police are doing their best but that their best simply isn't enough due to Burkina Faso not having the same resources to catch serial killers as the United States and Europe. The main investigator for this case Boukary Drabo however thinks otherwise stating that they have conducted extensive patrols of Boulmiougou and that several criminals in the area were taken off the streets and that this matter was being taken seriously.

In response to the October, 2010 murder of Marcelline Kabré the residents formed ""self-defense"" squads where the residents would patrol the streets and all blow a whistle if an attack occurred and any nearby residents would rush to the scene to subdue the killer. Constable Boukary Drabo however was against this idea because the technicians lacked any technical knowledge on how to investigate and actually catch the killer and also stated that ""ill-intentioned people"" could take advantage of this system to settle personal scores by accusing someone else of being the killer. Other residents took other precautions such as a curfew prohibiting them from heading outside when it's late, Changing the locks on their doors and changing the doors themselves to be made of metal.

The police did arrest mutable suspects as well including the dismantling of two gangs who committed various murders against security guards using the same M.O and on January 6, 2011 police dismantled a gang called Saïdou dit Saïd lead by a 26 year old man with the leader being a believer in fetishism, owning axes and would consume cocaine before his crimes with him being arrested for breaking into a home and attempting to rob valuables from it.

Many of the residents however didn't believe them to be the killers and even the police refused to identify them as ""L'homme à la hache"" and rather just stated that they had a similar M.O with this case still being being considered unsolved as of August, 2011. The reason why the residents don't believe either of these gangs or individuals to be the killer is because they are confident that one of their own is the murderer and that he was attending the meetings they had to discuss the issue.

The killer appeared to have known this area well such as when he killed the last victim in early January, 2011. Very few people know of the existence of this security guard even amongst the residents so when he was murdered that is why the residents became certain that the killer must have resided in the area. Especially with how he managed to get to the last victim which required going by a wall which many thought would be impossible unless they already knew where to go with one resident saying ""Either the killer used magic or he went through the wall of the neighboring house. Again, he would have had to master the geography of the neighborhood. He would have had to identify his victim, plan and execute his move,""

After January, 2011 however the murders stopped and no one ever went to trial for the 15 murders leaving this case unsolved and providing the residents without closure.

*\[Transcript From Video Below\]*

On Saturday 2nd August 1947, at around 1:45pm, an Avro Lancastrian Mk.III passenger plane known as ‘Stardust’ departed from Buenos Aires, Argentina to make a roughly 3 hour 45 minute trip to Santiago, Chile. On board the British South American Airways flight were five crew members and six passengers, including the Captain, Commander Reginald J. Cook, an experienced and former RAF pilot during World War II. The flight itself was the last leg of a journey which originated from London, with the trip across the Atlantic taking place in a York aircraft, transferring to the Stardust for the crossing of the Andes Mountains.

At around 5:41pm, after transmitting routine communications to the plane as usual, the control tower at Los Cerrillos Airport in Santiago received this morse code message from Stardust:

‘ETA Santiago 17:45 hrs STENDEC’

Perplexed by the final word in the telegram, the Chilean operator requested Stardust’s radio officer, Dennis Harmer, to relay the message back to him, only to hear the same word, STENDEC, repeated loud and clearly twice in succession. After the third time, communications ceased, and the aircraft disappeared, never reaching its final destination. With the plane supposedly minutes away from the airport, the final word from the Lancastrian became shrouded in mystery when the plane, along with everyone on board, vanished into thin air.

Presumed to have crash landed somewhere along the route, a five day effort began by both Chilean and Argentine search teams, including fellow BSAA pilots, yet no trace of the aircraft or it’s passengers were found. The official 1947 report into Stardust’s disappearance highlighted a number of possibilities as to what likely happened to the ill-fated flight, with multiple factors potentially playing a role in its demise.

It was firstly noted that the Trans-Andean journey from Buenos Aires to Santiago can be taken via three routes: The Central (and most direct) via Mendoza, The Southern via Planchon and The Northern via San Juan. The central route via Mendoza was considered to be the quickest of the three, yet potentially the most dangerous depending on weather conditions. Both in London and in Buenos Aires, the pilot, Reginald Cook, had been briefed not to take this option if bad weather prevailed, but despite this advice, Cook had chosen to fly Stardust along this central route. The weather on the day consisted of snowstorms in the Andes Mountains with moderate to intense turbulence, whilst visual contact with the ground would have been extremely low and unfit for flying. To put it simply, Cook chose the worst route possible in consideration of the conditions, which more than likely played a key role in the plane’s disappearance.

It was also noted that, despite being a pilot for four years and accruing a total flying time of nearly 2,000 hours for both the RAF and the BSAA, this was Cook’s first flight across the Andes as Captain.

It was concluded that, being his first Trans-Andean flight in command, and in view of the weather conditions, Cook should not have crossed via the direct route, and despite the absence of a wreckage, the plane likely perished somewhere along the snowy peaks of the Andes Mountains. 

Whilst many accepted that the fate of Stardust and it’s crew had been settled, the absence of a wreckage, along with the mysterious circumstances surrounding its final message, lead to widespread speculation, with theories spanning from sabotage to extraterrestrial in nature. With the disappearance occurring less than a month after the now infamous Roswell incident, unexplained events such as a vanishing plane were easily connected to the possibility of alien interference. In fact, this conspiracy ran for so long that even a Spanish magazine published in the 1970’s, which was dedicated to UFO’s and the paranormal, named itself after the now  infamous morse code.

Understanding STENDEC has been the quest for many experienced and avid radio operators, with online forums dedicated to deciphering what Dennis Harmer was trying to say. With the word not existing in international morse code, or any spoken language at the time, interpreting STENDEC has led to many varying theories.

Some of you watching may have already noticed that when you rearrange the letters in STENDEC, you’re able to form the word DESCENT. Whilst it's certainly a bizarre coincidence, especially given the circumstances, the theory goes that Harmer was trying to inform the control tower that the plane was going down. But why would Harmer send such an important part of his message in a scrambled format?

When flying at high altitudes, oxygen molecules are harder to inhale, and if a plane is not pressurized, it can lead to hypoxia, a condition which can impair or even completely destroy your ability to function.

The Lancastrian was an unpressurized aircraft, meaning that the crew and passengers could have been subject to hypoxia had their oxygen system failed, and so some suggest that this may have led to Harmer sending parts of his final message in a confused state.

Whilst a reasonable theory on the surface, it’s unfortunately also quite reasonable to discredit. Firstly, despite it being easy to rearrange STENDEC quickly in English text, doing the same in morse code is much more complex and highly implausible due to the nature of the language. 

Each letter in morse code consists of a number of unique dots and dashes, so to scramble a word like descent in such a way is highly unlikely, especially three times in succession. Also, in the 1947 report, the oxygen system was noted as being fully charged, along with nine emergency bottles before leaving Buenos Aires. The chances of all of these failing are extremely low, so the theory of hypoxia and the anagram has been ruled out by many.

Another noticeable similarity is that the word STENDEC has some resemblance to the word STARDUST, and perhaps Harmer misspelled the name of the aircraft in morse code. This would mean the message he was trying to send Los Cerrillos was instead:

‘ETA Santiago 17:45 hrs Stardust’

When you look at the beginning of the words, you can notice some similarities, which shows how easy it can sometimes be to mistranslate morse code. If spacing between letters is hard to distinguish, it’s clear to see how some characters can be accidentally mistaken for others, leading to incorrect words or phrases. The Chilean operator did mention how Harmer’s messages came through unusually fast, so there is every chance that some letters were incorrectly spaced and caused confusion to the control tower.

Whilst this possibility lends true to the first half of the word, the rest does not match up with this theory, and considering it was sent through and received the exact same three times over, it’s hard to imagine this error occurring on both ends.

Furthermore, aircraft were usually referred to by their registration, which in Stardust’s case was G-AGWH, rather than the more romantic monikers the airline had given them. It’s not even common practice for a plane to transmit its name at the end of a routine message, so this theory also unfortunately falls flat.  

In morse code, there are various short-hand acronyms and abbreviations which help convey much longer messages quickly. A common example of this would be SOS, which is the internationally recognised distress signal in morse code to call for help. There are theories that STENDEC was an abbreviation or acronym of a much larger phrase, and when you break it down you can imagine a whole host of sentences could be constructed using these letters. The most widely speculated of these phrases is the following:

‘Severe Turbulence Encountered Now Descending Emergency Crash Landing’

I couldn’t find a source for this, but according to theorists online, this was a known phrase for allied fighter pilots in WWII for if their plane was about to crash land. This one individual in particular mentioned that he asked his 80 year old father, who remembers hearing the phrase being used often by the radio operator on his ship when he served in the Merchant Marine during WWII. The crew of Stardust, including the radio operator Harmer, had all served in the RAF previously during WWII, so if this phrase is true, then it is possible that they were all familiar with the term and used it in a time of crisis.

The problem here though is that, even if this was the case, it would be unusual for Harmer to use a phrase which was not internationally recognised, and only specifically known to allied participants of the war. As mentioned previously, the standard morse code for a distress signal is SOS, which is much easier and quicker to communicate than STENDEC.

Whilst it’s possible that STENDEC could mean any one of these phrases, there’s nothing definitive I can find which suggests that this phrase ever meant anything previously, making it more unlikely that this word was used intentionally at all.

As mentioned in a previous theory, morse code can be easily  misinterpreted if incorrectly spaced or misheard by the receiver. With morse code being a binary combination of dots and dashes, something as simple as one or two incorrect inputs can make a drastic difference to how a word is interpreted.

For example, if you lose the first two dots in the word STENDEC, and rearrange the spacing of the letters, the word could instead be interpreted as ‘ETA LA(E)TE’, albeit with a rogue ‘E’ thrown into the mix. ETA LATE sounds like a reasonable message a plane would communicate to a control tower, although in the context of the whole sentence, it contradicts the first part completely, as they were only four minutes away from their destination.

More interestingly, the morse code for STENDEC is only one character off from instead spelling VALP, which is almost the call sign for the closest airport to Valparaiso, 110km northwest of Santiago. 

Could it be that Stardust were informing Los Cerrillos that they were on course for Rodelillo Airfield near Valparaiso instead, diverging from their original route? If so, according to their timings, they had already passed Los Cerrillos, where they could have safely landed as intended, so this doesn’t seem to make much sense either.

The last two possible mistranslations both involve an input mistake of some sort, but there is another phrase which uses the exact same morse code sequence as STENDEC but with different spacing. Without rearranging any of the inputs, and just separating the spacing differently, you can come up with the phrase ‘SCTI AR’. This is, in my opinion, the most plausible theory of what STENDEC was supposed to be.

SCTI is the international airline code for Los Cerrillos Airport, and AR is a commonly used prosign for the word ‘OUT’, or ‘End Of Transmission’. This sentence now makes perfect sense, with Harmer announcing that they were expected to arrive in Santiago at 17:45 hours, at Los Cerrillos Airport.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation had only recently implemented the airline code for Los Cerrillos just four months prior to the event in April 1947, so it’s more than possible that the airport’s radio operator was not yet familiar with the term and failed to recognise it.

With that in mind, and the fact that the operator himself mentioned that Harmer sent the message extremely quickly, it’s likely that this was the message after all. A mix of misinterpretation and a lack of recent knowledge led to the operator instead hearing the term STENDEC, which, combined with the disappearance of the plane, led to one of South America’s greatest aviation mysteries.

Ok, so that covers the theory of the mysterious phrase, but it doesn’t answer the mystery of what happened to the plane. That part of the puzzle wouldn’t be solved until half a century later.

In 1998, over 50 years after the disappearance of Stardust, a group of Argentine mountaineers climbing Mount Tupungato, one of the highest mountains in the Andes and roughly 50 miles east of Santiago, stumbled upon the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine of the Lancastrian. A few years later, more debris was found on the mountain, suggesting that the plane had made a head-on impact with the ground due to the close proximity and condition of the wreckage. Several body parts were also discovered, most of them intact due to being preserved in ice, and were later confirmed through DNA to be the passengers and crew of Stardust. Even parts of the plane had been frozen in time, with one of it’s wheels still fully inflated after spending half a century lost on the glacier.

Investigators concluded that the crew, flying in a snowstorm against a powerful jet stream, must have become confused about their location and believed they were closer to their destination then they actually were, with the crash being the result of a controlled descent into terrain. Due to the poor visibility caused by the storm, it’s possible that the crew were unaware that their plane was on course to collide with the mountainside, and unknowingly plummeted the aircraft into the summit before eventually succumbing to the elements. It is thought that the plane may have caused an avalanche upon impact, resulting in the snowy burial of the aircraft, concealing it from searchers whilst at the same time preserving it for its eventual discovery years later. When Harmer and his crew sent their final message to Los Cerrillos, they had no idea that they were seconds away from a fatal impact.

Despite Stardust’s fate now fully resolved, the mystery of STENDEC is still argued to this day, with no definitive conclusion on what Dennis Harmer was intending to communicate that evening. I personally believe that the word was a misinterpretation of the code, but theories span far and wide on what the now notorious phrase stood for. At the end of the day, with the crew of Stardust lost to time, we may never know the true meaning of STENDEC, and like many mysteries...

Sometimes These Enigmas Never Decipher. End Credits.

501,Key_Badger7434,[],1637566834,"So I saw this tiktok. It’s a woman with a dog head apple filter on and she’s sitting on the ground, crying. She is holding a lighter and an incense coil. Then there’s two body of texts. The first one said “I sleep alone every day are there anyone with me” and the second says “whats👉447873932661”. I sent it to my friend thinking it was funny, like in a cringey way and we joked about it being a kidnapping. She said I should call the number in the TikTok. I did but it didn’t work. I then looked it up on google and only got one result which was a phone tracking website in the UK(Great Britain). Then she said to look at the TikTok more and I saw she had a large bruise on her chest which raised some red flags. But why would someone kidnapped have access to the internet or if they were able to steal a phone for a second, post a cryptic TikTok. And the account had no followers or doesn’t follow anyone. The account had two videos but the account got taken down and they only reuploaded the second one. The person is holding a lighter and an incense coil. In the second video she lights the incense coil with the same bodies of text. Also the both of the TikTok’s captions had no hashtags and the first one says “fdhfgvn” and the second TikTok’s caption is “ftghfghf”. It could be a arg which would explain a lot.

502,60thfever,[],1637561316,"Hello all, 

I just wanted to post this in regards to the Zodiac Killer case.   I believe that Joseph Paul Franklin is the Zodiac Killer and wanted to share the info on his name clues alone.  There are tons of clues that point to Franklin but this post is just for his name.  

Joseph Paul Franklin was a racist serial killer who killed many people in the late 70's, but has never been suspected of being the Zodiac and wanted to share this: 

&amp;#x200B;

Joseph Paul Franklin is the Zodiac and here is why as simple as I can give the major clues, I say major because there are so many smaller clues that point to Franklin you can write a book on it more than likely. 

The Symbol:  

The symbol of the Zodiac is often mistaken for an astrological sign, a “Zodiac Sign” , but if you look up Nazi symbols it is actually the “Celtic Cross” but this symbol is often used in neo Nazi Circles.  

( I would post the symbol here but not sure if I can post a neo nazi symbol here)  Please wiki Nazi symbols and you will see the ""Zodiac"" symbol there as well. 

For reference please see the wiki page for Nazi symbols: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi\_symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_symbolism)

The Name: 

Joseph Paul Franklin was born James Vaughn Jr 

Please note a few interesting things about the name. 

The name James Vaughn Jr is 13 characters just like in 

the unsolved 13 character cipher the Z13. 

Notice how the J’s are in the “A’s spot, could the J’s convert to A’s in his coding system? 

The name Joseph Paul Franklin is actually 18 characters just like the 18 characters in the unsolved Z18 pulled from the Z408 cipher from the Zodiac Killer.

At one point the Zodiac said my name is “FK”.  Is this an abbreviation for Franklin?  Franklin = FK?  

Have a look at the symbol of  one of the last confirmed Zodiac letters: 

[http://www.zodiacciphers.com/uploads/4/9/7/1/4971630/25\_orig.gif](http://www.zodiacciphers.com/uploads/4/9/7/1/4971630/25_orig.gif)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, notice what looks like a backward “J” next letter a cross between a “P” and an “F” then an “N”.  On the “J” looks like a backward “K” as well, the initials JPFKN?  

Many of the first letters of the Zodiac all had Franklin Roosevelt on the front cover

And at one point he asks, “How much is on my head now?”  and on that particular letter was the Franklin Roosevelt Stamp.  

The Halloween Card symbol

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I interepret this as the initials “J” then the four dots equal “Paul” then the “F” for Franklin. 

In an unconfirmed letter which may or may not have been sent by the Zodiac: 

Reference: https://www.zodiacciphers.com/zodiac-news/category/scotch-tape-letter

Slaves in Paradice: 

Franklin had dabbled or had been associated with Christian Identity.  Christian Identity  has a line of thinking that non white people will be the slaves in paradise once the war/Armageddon is finished and heaven on earth has been established.  

Not sure if this was his thinking but an overlooked clue in deciphering what the Zodiac meant by expressing his desire to collect slaves for paradice.  

Appearance: 

Issues and Questions: 

There is not evidence he was ever even in California at that time, so how can he be the Zodiac?  

 I actually have no evidence that he was even in California at that time, but not much is known where he was actually at during his early life, Wikipedia just says that he was a drifter, and there are some varying accounts, so he can’t be ruled out as the Zodiac.  I must add that he did head to the San Francisco area in the late 70’s while on the run for other murders to ditch his murder weapon at a flea market there. That of course begs the question how did he know the flea market was there, he had to have been in San Francisco before. 

Also,  Franklin had crossed the country murdering people, no reason to believe he didn’t at some point murder in California we just don’t know about it. 

Zodiacs victims were white, Franklin killed for racial reasons so how could he have been the Zodiac? 

Many of Franklins victims were young white women  which he says/claims were killed because they had expressed a willingness or did date black men.  Around that time and just my opinion he was more than likely also involved with the National Youth Alliance which basically advocated violence against young white liberals which they feared were all becoming communist and radicalized.",Joseph Paul Franklin is The Zodiac Killer
503,Toni-Cipriani,[],1637526543,"What cases have left you baffled from the actions of the victim due to them behaving in a bizarre way before they turned up murdered or disappeared?  

Personally the case of Bryce Laspisa has always left me confused.  He was driving and pulled over multiple times for an extended period. His family sent someone to check on him a few times and he was very nonchalant about the whole thing. As if it were normal.  There is a theory that he may have been suicidal and had been driving around all day trying to work up the courage to commit the act. This truly leaves me confused as others have said it may have been the result of a mental break.  

My theory leans towards Bryce possibly being suicidal. According to Bryce's roommate Bryce had been sending unusually thoughtful messages. Thanking his roommate for being part of his life, he also abruptly broke up with his girlfriend a few times in the days leading up to his disappearance.  Bryce's car was discovered in what very likely could have been a fatal crash but Bryce was nowhere to be found. 

Another that stands in my mind is the disappearance of Mitrice Richardson.  Mitrice had gone to an expensive restaurant and was saying strange things to guests and staff. She refused to pay for her meal even though it was later discovered upon searching her car she had more than enough to cover. I believe Mitrice was the unfortunate result of a mental break brought on by a manic state. 

I have included a link about both the disappearance of Bryce and Mitrice Richardson.

Rory was last seen on CCTV walking through York City centre just after midnight on November 20th, 2015, heading in the direction of Skeldergate Bridge. He was not captured on CCTV after this, and extensive searches of the Ouse River have turned up no trace of him. Door-to-door enquiries have similarly led to no new leads or sightings.

Identified as Wendy Louise Baker who was 16 at the time of her death, she was found approximately 100 miles from her home in Coatsville, PA, at a truck stop in NJ.

Considering the relatively close distance to her home, I am surprised that she wasn’t identified then. Of course news traveled slower, but the police were actively investigating the case and the media was also on top of it. I found this news article from 1993 and I am sure there are many others like it:

Also, after looking up the father’s obituary who passed away in 2017 (see link below), I found it interesting that it states he is survived by his three daughters, to include Wendy. I guess he never gave up hope that she was alive all that time and had just runaway (maybe?).

I just remembered a mystery I witnessed and partook in when I was a child and was never able to solve, no man or encyclopedia could help.  


I'm living in Russia and my parents took me camping to a remote wild tourist place called Molocanova Shel on a shore of a black sea almost every summer. (It is now closed to tourists as Putin ""allegedly Putin"" built a huge palace right in that spot)

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/4WKRw6sTWzRXXnWq9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4WKRw6sTWzRXXnWq9)  


There was (is) a small mountain river going through the Shel (a ""crack in the mountain"") with the tastiest water ever.  


What's mysterious - I once drowned a fly (don't know why I did it, I was just a curious kid of around 9 then) and after a minute or so **I saw a fly having red as blood eyes, alive and walking on the floor bed of the river, underwater! It walked there for at least 10 minutes until I got bored.**  


In the evening it piqued my interest and **through the next days, I caught and drowned dozen of flies with consistently the same results.**  


Parents just brushed me off and when I asked my biology teacher later that year he said it was nonsense. But **next summer we went there again and I successfully repeated the miraculous drowning several times over.**  


Then I found no answer and forgot it for almost 30 years until today.  


What could I witness back then?",River of the living dead flies

I’m late to the party - I know. But I watched the documentary  for the first time today. For those unfamiliar, here’s a link https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Taconic_State_Parkway_crash

Something about this case felt really off. For some reason I just didn’t feel like this is something this woman would do in her right state of mind. Either she was an alcoholic- which in this case even that much alcohol shouldn’t have impaired her so drastically that she’s driving on the highway in the wrong direction - or she wasn’t an alcoholic, which in that case, wtf would inspire her to drink that much and how tf was she not swerving. I don’t buy the murder suicide theory I’m sorry. It’s just my opinion but I feel like something was horribly wrong with her that day. 

I read the autopsy. I’m not a doctor. I’m not a scientist. So I could be wildly wrong. But she had no skull fractures, but she did have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. That can be caused from trauma, but also from stroke or brain aneurysm. The symptoms of these types of hemorrhages are: the worst headache of your life, vomiting, confusion, delirium, double vision, and light sensitivity. Also- caused by frequent alcohol intake. ALSO- she had blood clotting in an area of her brain which, when coupled with subarachnoid hemorrhage, indicates a brain aneurysm is the cause. 

Is it possible that she was indeed an alcoholic, who had had a brain aneurysm, caused from her excessive drinking. She seriously had every single symptom of this condition- vomiting, pain (tried to get pain pills), vision issues, and likely delirium (calling wrong numbers, calling people wrong names). This could have caused to her either intentionally drink to kill the pain (the headaches are referred to  on medical websites as worst headache ever) or out of delusion? 

I AM NOT A DOCTOR- so I could be so wrong. But have spent time researching, and will also add that medical websites state that severe head injuries CAN cause subarachnoid bleeding, but that it is a separate problem known as a TRAUMATIC subarachnoid hemorrhage- that is not the language used on autopsy. 

Apparently  - I am not the only one who noticed this- I found the below comment after writing this post looking for anyone else who discussed this possibility  on 

https://madmuser.com/2011/09/14/diane-schulers-ghost/#comments

I am a healthcare professional. I worked in an emergency room for 20 years. Diane’s family is not evil. They are merely baffled and in disbelief that this responsible women would purposely drink 10 shots of vodka on her way home from a camping trip.And I agree with them .
Diane had signs and symptoms of a subdural hematoma, and I can’t believe the coroner’s did not consider it
She had it all: headache nausea, visual changes and altered mental status.
Her autopsy showed traumatic bleeding in the brain which may have obscured the original pre crash bleed in the brain.
So what she had vodka in the car. Maybe she was bringing it home for company at home in the near future or didn’t want to leave it in camper for teens to break in and get at. Who knows .
She was disoriented and probably did mistake the. Vodka for water or was just in so much pain and delusional she didn’t kno what she was doing.
She doesn’t fit the picture of what the situation superficially points to. She Showed no signs of agitation to anyone in McDonald’s or gas station. But heaeache started and was looking for some meds at thd gaz station. Her Conditioned deteriorated while driving . I have seen patients like this more than once.
It makes much more sense to me.
The smartest doctors in thd world make mistakes and I believe the experts blew it
Oh the pot…. she didn’t hide it. Hef sister in law knew about it.
But everyone close to her knew she just wasn’t a drinker. Only an occasional drinker.
Her poof family left in to be slandered and shamed when ig is entirEly possible anx probable this was a severe, acute lifethreatening medical event with disastrous timing and outcome.
She was known not to be a complainer and forged on not knowing how seriously ill she was. And once her mental status started changing she was no longer able to make any sort of a decision.",There’s something wrong with Aunt Diane- I have a different theory

509,MaddiKate,[],1637454153,"Hello, I am back with another cold case from the Gem State. This is case that I have been sitting on for a long, long time. I wanted to wait until more information was released to do a proper write-up. Earlier today, the Facebook page ""Idaho Cold Cases"" released never-before-shared information about Krystyn's disappearance. I cannot link Facebook pages, but know that a large portion of my information comes from there- all credit to Crystal, the owner of the page.

Krystyn Rae Dunlap-Bosse [DOB: 01/24/1994] was a teenager living in Boise, ID. Not much is known about her early life. Some agencies list her name as Dunlap, while others list her name as Dunlap-Bosse. I am not sure if this was due to a parent getting remarried, or if her parents remained married but chose to give her both of their last names. 

Krystyn's story unfolds in sort of a slow-moving car crash. In September 1992, while working for a pizza stand during Boise's Art in the Park festival, she met a man named Charles ""Corey"" Castro. They reportedly hit it off instantly. There was ~~one~~ several ~~litte~~ big problems: Corey, a Texas native, was 25 years old, married, and already had a generous rap sheet. 

As one would imagine, Krystyn's parents were not supportive of this relationship. Her parents took immediate action to try to end this relationship, but were not successful. Krystyn's mother went as far as to frequently contact Corey's parole officer to try to intervene. The days went on, Krystyn turned 16, and she was still dating this Corey fool. By that point, her mother had gathered evidence that showed that Corey and Krystyn were having sex, and tried to press statutory rape charges (in Idaho, the age of consent is 16, but the other party cannot be more than 3 years older than them until they turn 18). However, when she tried to press charges, Boise PD and the prosecutor's offices refused to take action because, ""she knew what she was doing.""

Corey did not stop. Unfortunately, their relationship escalated from statuatory rape to intense levels of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse towards Krystyn, according to her closest friends. He would also repeatedly tell her that he was going through a divorce, when this was not the case.

On October 13, 1994, a meeting/intervention was held between Krystyn, her mother, Corey, his wife (!!), and his PO, in hopes that Corey would confess to everything. When the meeting occurred, Corey looked all of these people in their eyes and said, and I quote: ""Shit happens!"" Reportedly, Krystyn left the meeting with her mother, sobbing. 

The following day, Krystyn stayed home while her mother went to work. This would be the last time she would ever see her daughter again. When she came home from work, she found that Krystyn was missing, along with most of her important belongings. Krystyn left behind a note saying something in the lines of, ""I need to sort myself out, I'll be back in a year.""

Krystyn is officially reported as going missing on 10/14/1994. However, there is apparently concrete evidence that Krystyn was alive for at least two months prior to disappearning, as she allegedly called her close friends on a regular basis until mid-Decemeber 1994. Her friends would also help transport her (Krystyn never obtained a driver's license) and Krystyn listed her address as that of one of her friend's. Reportedly, there was even an incident during that time period were the police found Krystyn and Corey arguing in front of a liquor store, but they were released without further action (I an unsure if Krystyn was listed as missing at that time). These friends alledge that they last saw Krystyn sometime in December 1994, when she told them that Corey and she were going to take a trip to McCall, ID. After that trip, Corey returned... without Krystyn. 

If you thought Corey wasn't done being a goddamn creep, you were wrong. Not long after Krystyn disappeared, Corey started dating another woman, who had a young daughter. Corey sexually abused this girl. In 1998, he was convicted on a charge of lewd &amp; lascivious conduct with a minor under 16. He served prison time for this crime, and is now a registered sex offender. 

Krystyn's family and friends continue to search for answers. Corey has kept his nose clean since then- no new charges, seems to comply with his sex offender terms, but remains tight-lipped about what happened to Krystyn. The Boise PD consider this case to be open. She was initially listed as a runaway, due to the circumstances surrounding her case. In the years following, it has turned into a foul play investigation. Her family has stated, “This brings us up to now, having to assume that Krystyn is no longer alive, and some evil came to her. We have no body, no explanation, and no person being held responsible for her death. We are sure that someone knows something about the circumstances of her death but is fearful to come forward. It is our intent to hopefully make it more appealing for this person or people to come forward knowing there is a HEALTHY REWARD offered in ADDITION to the Crime Stopper reward.”

This is a case that seems to have an obvious conclusion- to me, it seems obvious that Corey played a role in Krystyn's disappearance and likely death. There is way too much circumstantial evidence for me to think otherwise. The mystery is trying to fill in the blanks on what happened.

What do you think transpired between October and December of 1994? How long do you think Krystyn was alive for after she ran away? What happened on that fateful trip to McCall? If Corey is responsible, what would it take to prosecute him on charges related to her disappearance/death?

**The death of 2nd Lt. Pamela D. Donovan**

Images of Pamela

[**https://ibb.co/94cNXHt**](https://ibb.co/94cNXHt) 

[**https://ibb.co/vmVbWB7**](https://ibb.co/vmVbWB7) 

2LT Pamela D. Donovan was a nurse assigned to the 85th Evacuation Hospital in Qui Nhon, South Vietnam.  On July 8, 1968, 2LT Donovan died at the 3rd Field Hospital in Saigon.  It was reported she had died as a result of taking her own life. Donovan reportedly succumbed to an unusual South East Asian variant of pneumonia secondary to a Doriden overdose from which she lapsed into a coma. Doriden was the brand-name version of glutethimide, a barbiturate used to treat insomnia. Donovan was 26 years old and had been in Vietnam 4 months. There appears to be the possibility that the circumstances of her death involved foul play.

Pamela Dorothy Donovan was born on March 25, 1942 in Wirral, Merseyside, England to Irish parents, Joyce and Ted Donovan. Her family later returned to Ireland, and In 1956 they immigrated to the United States. The family settled in Brighton, Massachusetts, and Pamela became a U.S. Citizen in 1967. Pamela has a younger brother, Anthony, and a sister, Elizabeth. The family was deeply religious and Pamela had considered becoming a nun before undertaking nursing training.

Pamela had graduated from St. Elizabeth's Hospital School of Nursing in 1965 and became a Registered Nurse. At  this time she was living in Allston, Massachusetts. She graduated from the Newton Country Day School, but also attended schools in Ireland, England, and Canada.

Pamela was much affected by battlefield portrayals on the news, and she shared with colleagues her distress that soldiers were in such dreadful circumstances. She had learned that all the nurses were volunteers, and then decided she should become a US citizen and volunteer to serve in South Vietnam.

2nd Lt. Pam Donovan joined the Army Reserve Nurse's Corps and underwent intensive jungle training prior to departing for her tour in South Vietnam on 10 April 1968, assigned to the 85th Evac Hospital in Qui Nhon. 

Pamela’s mother, Joyce, wrote a book called Grasping the Nettle which was a biography of their family life and the influence of their religious beliefs. In that book, Joyce writes that in May of 1968, Pamela had written that she went to the beach and suffered severe sunburn and was hospitalized in Qui Nhon where she was stationed. During her recovery, Pamela made an audio tape for her parents in which she ""sounded happy and in good spirits.""

In subsequent letters she told her parents of her plans to travel to Japan and Australia at the conclusion of her one year tour of duty in Vietnam. She wrote of the possibility of applying to a number of nursing schools in the USA and furthering her nursing degree.

In another letter Pamela told her parents that she had become aware of the existence of a ""heroin ring"" within the hospital and had determined that is was her duty to report this. Her parents wrote back cautioning their daughter to be very careful, that she could be putting herself in extreme danger. 

Shortly after in June of 1968, Pamela's mother Joyce was hospitalized. Pamela wrote to her mother daily giving her great support.

On July 4, 1968, Joyce and Ted received a cable from Vietnam stating that Pamela had been placed on the seriously ill list on the 3rd of July, as a result of an overdose of barbiturates, stating that she had been found unconscious in her billet and was hospitalized in Vietnam.

Another cable arrived from Vietnam saying that Pamela was still unconscious and was being flown to the 3rd Field Hospital in Saigon where she could receive ""more appropriate treatment.”

On July 9 a limousine came to her parents front door as a high ranking officer informed them that Pamela had died the previous day, July 8th and that the cause of her death was pneumonia.

Ted telephoned the Army Nursing Recruitment Headquarters in Boston where Pamela had enlisted and the Red Cross. Joyce and Ted had many questions but none received proper answers. They wrote Pamela’s Commanding Officer and the Chaplain in Vietnam but received no response. The Senior Army Officer handling the case in the US intimated that if they would stop asking questions Pamela would be given a full military funeral – the obvious implication being that a military funeral would be refused if they continued their inquiries. For Pamela’s sake they asked no further questions.

On July 12 the post office brought a letter to Pamela's parents from their dead daughter, dated July 3, five days before her death:

""Dearest Mummy and Daddy, I know over the years you have been unhappy, as I have been unfaithful to the Church and to going to Mass and the Sacraments. Well, I want you to know that last night I went to the Chaplain out here to Confession, and this morning I went to Mass and Holy Communion. I feel a new person..... All my love Pamela. ""

On July 18 Pamela's parents received the death certificate: ""Died 8 July 1968 in Vietnam from pneumonia secondary to overdose of barbiturates.""

In September the family received a second death certificate with an additional sentence added: ""Self destruction while mentally unsound"".

It did not seem possible to them that their daughter, so happy on July 3rd, could have taken her own life five days later.

Six months after her death a nurse friend of Pamela's from Vietnam called to tell her mother ""the truth"" about what had happened to Pamela. Reportedly, she said ""No I can't tell you. I am too afraid of what might happen to me” and hung up. A few weeks later there was allegedly another call from another of Pamela's friends from Vietnam who also wanted to tell the truth but was too afraid.

All of this left the family with questions. 

Did 2LT Pamela Donovan take a barbiturate overdose, contract pneumonia and die? Or is her death attributable somehow to the heroin ring she had referred to in an early letter to her mother?

Can I ask the thoughts of the Reddit community?

513,Grimauldbird,[],1637410550,"  On August 10th 2016 the body of 28 year old Frank Galicia was found in an evacuation stairwell at Westfield Shopping Mall in San Francisco.
 Frank was found with rope around his mouth and head. The rope was tired to a rail. Legs facing up towards the stairs or on the stairs. His pants and underwear were pulled down and it appeared he had been dragged for a distance.
 An autopsy would find that Frank had blunt force trauma to his body, as well as having alcohol and methamphetamines in his system. They level of alcohol and drugs was determined not to be high enough to contribute to his death.
His cause of death is classed as Undetermined.

 There are no suspects in Franks death. His death was initially ruled a homicide but was reclassified a week later to be a suspicious death. With an officer saying that his death didn’t appear to be a homicide but did it appear to be a natural one either.

 Frank was a 28 year old chef at the Michelin star restaurant Sons &amp; Daughters. He was working there six months before his death. He had apparently called the restaurant to tell them he was coming from Boston to cook for them and wasn’t taking no for an answer. They hired him on the spot.
 By all accounts things were going well for Frank he had landed his dream job, had recently started dating a woman and had found an apartment, after staying in hostels since his move from Boston.

 Tuesday August 9th was the last time Franks girlfriend Ariel saw and heard from him. They had gotten their debit cards switched as they looked similar, they met up that night to switch them back. He had told Ariel he was going to the mall to buy some jeans. 
 After messaging him at midnight, to say she missed him, Ariel received no reply.  She continued to message him throughout Wednesday unaware that his body had been discovered at 10:15 that morning. 
 She called the police requesting a welfare check after becoming concerned getting no response from him. Police questioned her about Frank.

 Franks brother Louis visited the spot where his brothers body was found. He found the stairwell propped open. People were able to access the it from the malls food court. A cctv camera close to the stairwell was covered with red spray paint.
 
 Two days after his body was discovered a 20 year old was mugged and beaten in a restroom. And on the 30th August a man and a woman were robbed of their laptop and cell phones by a group of teenage boys. After giving chase the man was punched by a member of the group.

 His brother said things were finally looking up for Franks. His girlfriend refuted the idea what from was looking for drugs or committed suicide.

 What happened to Frank that night?

514,HurricaneBells,[],1637407867,"Peng Shuai, one of China’s most accomplished tennis stars, disappeared from public view in early November after a rare public allegation of sexual assault against a retired top official in China’s Communist Party.  

Peng Shuai, 35 years old, is the only Chinese tennis player to ever have attained a world No. 1 tennis ranking. Ms. Peng represented China at three Summer Olympics, including the 2008 Beijing Games. 

ALLEGATION

On the evening of Nov. 2, a post on Peng Shuai’s verified social-media account made a sexual assault allegation against former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli. The post, on China’s Weibo platform, said that Ms. Peng had an on-and-off relationship with Mr. Zhang lasting for some years that was sometimes consensual and sometimes involved coercion, including forced sex. It disappeared after about 20 minutes and she hasn’t been seen in public since. 

REACTION

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Joe Biden's administration is ""deeply concerned"" about the situation. She said: ""We join in the calls for Chinese authorities to provide independent and verifiable proof of her whereabouts and that she is safe. 

The United Nations has insisted on a fully transparent investigation into Peng’s claims. 

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has threatened to pull tournaments out of China and the men's ATP has demanded clarity from the Chinese authorities. It comes after Andy Murray joined an online campaign to help find Peng. Other tennis stars including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic are among those concerned over her whereabouts. 

UPDATE

The official newspaper of the ruling party announces she has been at home relaxing and will be back in public soon. The mystery surrounding the tennis champion took a fresh twist on Friday after photos of her supposedly relaxing at home  surrounded by soft toys and with a grey cat. 

Experts have expressed scepticism and questioned the authenticity of the images. 

An email said to be from Peng was released on Wednesday by CGTN, but doubts have also been raised over its authenticity. It says the sexual assault claim ""is not true"" and adds: ""I'm not missing, nor am I unsafe. I've just been resting at home and everything is fine"". 

Where is Peng Shuai?

515,p1051,[],1637398722,"Hi friends,

I too was intrigued by the mystery, but Hollywood stories and The Thomas Crowne Affair that has appeal as a movie crime story, where the lead character is portrayed as likable - What keeps bothering me is that is real life with real people - and there are real consequences. Theodore John Conrad made a decision to steal, and at some point, he decide he cared more about stealing and how that would benefit him, and stopped caring about anyone or anything else, or the impact it would have.

The headline sounds like a great detective novel - ""After a 52-year chase, authorities ID the man behind an infamous Ohio bank heist""

[https://www.npr.org/2021/11/14/1055659885/cleveland-ohio-bank-robber-identified-marshals-service](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/14/1055659885/cleveland-ohio-bank-robber-identified-marshals-service)

The best part of the story is that he was finally caught. And finally, justice prevailed. For the religious crowd, he finally ""came clean"" and admitted his crime on his death bed. He stole from everyone and lied to everyone and cheated everyone.

I also wondered how he could he get a new identify so easily in 1969? This is the other thing that bothered me. Then, it was generally assumed that people were good, honest, and had good intentions. That's the world they wanted. And ideals they upheld. Stealing sounds small and inconsequential, but like anything else, it can weigh on your conscience and soul. There' nothing heroic about a life of lying. When he deceived people at the S.S. office to get a new identity, lied to his future friends, to his employers, to his future wife, and daughter - all who believed and trusted him. Who took him at his word.

As many of you said, and his nephew said here, his actions had lasting consequences on the family he left behind. Even the security guards - people who were just trying to do their jobs, that he deceived. The bank staff that worked h him and trusted him, the Marshalls who devoted and dedicate their life's work to helping make the world a safer place by finding those who commit crimes so they can be held accountable.

A lie is always a lie.. Deception is always deception. And thankfully, truth is always the truth.

What is right and honest and good ...is always good..Everything has a consequence. He lied to those he met casually, and those whose lives he had a more lasting impact on. His death-bed confession felt like some kind of truth, finally. Maybe he could longer live a lie.","Notorious thief caught after 52 years - lies, crime, and I why couldn't believe it"
516,thomycat,[],1637368037,"Hi first time posting here and I do not know if this sort of post is allowed here so please delete if inappropriate. I am just posting because I would like to share my view and hear your opinion. Sorry turned out quite long.  
  
As the title says I am currently watching the netflix documentary of Madeleine McCann. I have also read the wikipedia page and did a search here and read some threads pertaining to this case. Thanks to the documentary i got a better view of the case and got me thinking about some facts.  
First of all I do not think the parents are responsible for her disappearance despite initial doubts. It is safe to say we can definitely rule out that there was intent if they were indeed responsible. It does not add up to if they intend to kill Madeleine, to be doing so in a foreign country they are visiting for the first time while holidaying with friends and certainly not in a resort where there are so many other families around that you seem to have to interact with.  
Also Maddie was conceived with much difficulty and was costly in that sense so that does not add up as well (theories of Gerry selling her etc). Which means that the more likely scenario is negligence or a cover-up scenario if they were involved. Both are unfortunately too difficult to pull off. As the documentary has pointed out, it is very unlikely for a cover up that involves so many parties to succeed and survive scrutiny after all these years. The timeline also makes it very unlikely for them to be able to dispose the body AND keep her from being found.  
  
I am not talking about the timeline when they were dining and checking up on the kids. Even that I can understand the incoherency of their statements as they will definitely be chaotic and that is definitely more believable if it didn't all quite line up. It's not like they were adhering to a script and they were also drinking. We do though have certain facts, because they can be cross-examined: that Madeleine was picked up at 1800 from the kids club by Kate and Gerry went to tennis lessons. So Madeleine was definitely alive until then. These statements can be verified.  
  
So if we imagine that the allegations of them drugging the kids or some other sort of accident that caused Madeleines demise has happened, that must have happened in the space of about 2 and a half hours. Imagine having have to completely hide a body somewhere where she cant be found even after years or searching and showing up to dinner with friends while tucking the twins in bed and also risking that one of the (random) friends might check on Madeleine and find her missing before Kate or Gerry? Because that can only work if one can guarantee no one did that and we know that at nine one of them almost did just that without Kate or Gerry knowing. That is just not feasible. I read on a thread here posted 3 years ago someone describing them as surgeons therefore a-moral and wouldn't blink an eye if they discover Madeleine had died so they could definitely mingle after her death... i mean come on, are you listening to yourself? some people here don't have any grip on reality.  
Many argue disposing her in the ocean is possible because 1. if they are lucky she would be washed away and 2. if she was discovered you can argue accident. These seem unlikely due to certain facts. It is really more possible for a body to wash up. There is absolutely no time for her to be disposed far enough out of sea due to logistics and time. They are also doctors so if they for example drugged her, they would also know that you can trace for drugs. Kate herself suggest that they should check her twins for drugs due to suspicion that they have been drugged. Other types of accidents would most likely also point to them if discovered so ocean is not good idea.  
  
I also read here on reddit on ideas about them transporting her later and hiding her in a freezer till then and in the chapel intermittently? This just sound like a brainstorm idea from the PJ who i really think messed up the whole investigation for being so grossly incompetent. If i gathered correctly, almost immediately everyone was alerted and the alleged body transportation was only rented after 25 days. It just not possible if you use common sense, they were like Amy Winehouse, they couldn't go anywhere without being photographed even early on. They also had their entourage almost immediately so it is just not possible for the disposal scenario after the discovery.  
  
Reading some information on Wikipedia the most likely scenario is indeed an abduction. Some deduced she could be drugged by the perp and some even suggested that she has met the perps the night before hence the question of why Kate didn't come when they cried and the stain Kate noticed on Madeleine.  
Interestingly enough the area was portrayed as a safe haven with no criminality, i think even one of the officers mentioned that in the documentary. But the more you look at it the more obvious it is that its just a false image that they are trying to uphold as tourism is the main source of income for the community. According to BBC, there has been a fourfold increase of break ins in 2007 and twice 15 days before in the complex where the McCanns were staying in. The most curious aspect is the emergence of people gathering donations for a children home that do not exist. Some residents reported that suddenly the collectors would be standing in their homes. This seems for me the perfect reconnaissance method because it is quite useful to find out who is staying there and how the sleeping arrangements are etc. If no ones at home then they get lucky but if someone's there you can mutter an apology and state your purpose of collecting donations. Shady as fuck but definitely difficult to report to police and have them take it seriously. Unfortunately due to their habits in the evening they are really easy targets as they have some sort of ritual and their routine check ups can roughly be calculated.  
  
I think the reason netflix included Rui Pedro despite it happening 9 years earlier is to allude to this possibility. It would also answer a lot of questions that i have, for example, why did Kate scream ""they have taken her"" when she ran back to her group of friends? This would seem at first like a slip of tongue, an admission of guilt in an attempt to misdirect, but it can also be explained quite easily if we believe her, that she saw her child missing, and the window was open, that her conclusion instinctively would be that she was taken. This would definitely also explain why she hasn't been found after all these years.  
One curious fact about the window though is the fact that there is only one hand print. According to one of the friends they also felt the window was open when he checked in on Madeleine before Kate so the window could have been opened then. Then the window was closed when LE came. So what does this mean? It seems unlikely in any case, that there would be just one handprint of Kate's. Why did Amaral say that because this does not make sense. He said that the print was for opening the window and that's it. First of all, can you tell from a print if it was opening or closing a window? She has to be doing either or so the other motion has to also leave a print because the window was closed when LE arrived. If someone else closed it there has to be another print, because if it was one of the people helping in the search they wouldn't be wearing gloves, except they are LE. So its more likely this way: the perp, if the window was really utilised, has to be wearing gloves because that would explain only one print belonging to her. The window was open, and she closed it leaving the print or she touched it without opening or closing it. But if she were the perp she would though want the window opened. This also means the possibility leans more towards her herself closing it and hence not likely for her to be wanting to concoct a misdirection. But he said there are no glove prints, is it possible to leave glove prints? I have never heard of that maybe someone here knows.  
But in the end this is IMO a red herring. Since the back patio door was unlocked it is much more inconspicuous to use that than a window since lifting a child through a window would definitely raise eyebrows but carrying one openly seems quite normal for that resort.  
It seems very likely that she was abducted by organised crime. Her case is too famous and just by looking into the mirror she herself would have to notice, if she was abducted and raised by someone else ""benignly"", that she had the mark in her eye and would eventually come out. The sadder, but more likely possibility is that she is either dead and disposed professionally somewhere else, or held against her will. I also think it is logical for them to just take one child as it would be easier to handle. All and all fascinating how this short span of time and this seemingly normal family caused such a media frenzy and fascination from the whole world. I wish LE learn from this and other cases that we get better in preventing and recovering lost children.  
  
p.s. the more i read the comments the more i am amazed and sometimes appalled by some of the theories being posted here about this case, incredible! I hope i don't sound so crazy.

He was born in the the United States on the 9th of October 1910. He lived here for his first five years before his mother took him home to Norway. He lived in the Norwegian capital of Oslo (named Kristiania at the time). Here he got interested in agriculture and started his own business as a wholesaler of fruit and vegetables and became a well-known face in the trade fair in Oslo.

In 1972, Anker had phased out his wholesale business. His nephew, [Trond Anker Lie](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334546.jpg?imageId=14334546&amp;x=4.3973941368078&amp;y=4.9019607843137&amp;cropw=94.951140065147&amp;croph=95.098039215686&amp;width=583&amp;height=388.00000000000006&amp;compression=92), says that his uncle became a more worried man.  He was very afraid of getting sick.

&gt;He's the only person I know that used wool socks during the summer

**The disappearance and the phone call**

Thursday the 13th of July 1972 started out as a normal day. Norway was in holiday mode, and the weather was nice. William Anker Lie, [his wife Ragnhild](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334609.jpg?imageId=14334609&amp;x=0&amp;y=3.1971580817052&amp;cropw=100&amp;croph=96.269982238011&amp;width=583&amp;height=542&amp;compression=92) was visiting relatives on [Opsand farm in Ski](https://imgur.com/a/he9cT4w), right outside of Oslo, where they helped with the operation of the farm. The days before his disappearance, William had complained about a headache.

Trond was not present that day, but has gotten the incident retold:

&gt;They were sitting and eating dinner when he suddenly got up from the table. Ragnhild, his wife, asked where he was going, but he did not answer and went out to his car and disappeared.

After waiting for hours, they call William and Ragnhild's apartment in Oslo, hoping William went there. After a long time, someone finally picks up the phone. But there is no voice, just silence. It's not until Ragnhild asks if its William she's talking to that he answers. He says he's not feeling well enough to drive back to Ski. He has taken some pills, which is the reason he can't drive a car. The call ends and Ragnhild thinks he's going to return the next day. 

He never shows up.

**The apartment**

Two days after William drove away from his family, Ragnhild and William's brother go to the apartment to look for him. The sight that meets them makes them really worried. Trond says:

&gt;When they enter the apartment, they find clothes and paintings that has been carefully cut up. All of it belonged to Ragnhild and was placed on the table in the living room.

Ragnhild drives to the police station to give her statement. Here, she says that Anker had changed his behavior in the last few years. She had started to notice this after his stroke in 1969.

William Anker Lie was declared missing and wanted notices went out already the day after, on Sunday the 16th of July 1972, 3 days after he disappeared from the family dinner. [The wanted notices was put in the police paper Polititidende.](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334526.jpg?imageId=14334526&amp;x=0.33057851239669&amp;y=7.2429906542056&amp;cropw=96.363636363636&amp;croph=92.757009345794&amp;width=583&amp;height=398&amp;compression=92) His car, [a white Vauxhall Cresta from 1971](https://imengine.public.prod.agp.infomaker.io/?uuid=55047ce0-1fdb-5248-af3d-b5bbfcbe2517&amp;function=cropresize&amp;type=preview&amp;source=false&amp;q=75&amp;crop_w=0.99999&amp;crop_h=0.80357&amp;width=1200&amp;height=675&amp;x=1.0E-5&amp;y=0.09821) (pic: not actual car) with the license number DA 14027 was also wanted.

**The investigation**

Nobody knows where to start the investigation. The case gets sent to Oslo Police's Criminal department, which is the department that handles missing person cases. The following days, the wanted message is sent out to telegram agencies, newspaper editors and TV broadcasters. A description of Ankers height, outfit and car is published along with a [portrait image.](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334561.jpg?imageId=14334561&amp;x=0.68259385665529&amp;y=1.0706638115632&amp;cropw=99.317406143345&amp;croph=98.929336188437&amp;width=291&amp;height=462.99999999999994&amp;compression=92)

The police receives no tips or observations.

**The camping equipment**

Almost a month after Anker disappeared, the police accidentally finds something useful. A detective is sitting in his office, reading the newspaper called Hallingdølen. Here he sees a short notice. The sheriff in Nesbyen reports that some abandoned camping equipment has been found by the lake Trytetjern, a couple of kilometers from Nesbyen. When questioning Ragnhild earlier, she told the police that camping equipment was missing from their garage. The sheriff sends [a list of the items](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334633.jpg?imageId=14334633&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;cropw=99.828767123288&amp;croph=67.987804878049&amp;width=583&amp;height=224&amp;compression=92) found to the detective.

These items are as follows: a travel radio, a small outdoor table, a travel briefcase, camping chairs, a water jug, a yellow warning light, a coffee pot, a bad, a jar of strawberry jam with a handwritten  etiquette  saying ""Strawberry 1971"", and a cover for the propane stove.

One of the items caught their attention, the radio. It had a sticker that told them that the radio had been sold by Kjelsås Electronics in Oslo. When they contacted the store, they were told that this specific radio had been sold to William Anker Lie.

Ragnhild is immediately drawn to the jar of jam. She was the one that had made the jam and written the etiquette on the jar. There was no doubt, this was Anker's camping equipment.

**The witnesses**

[Terje Klevjer](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334659.jpg?imageId=14334659&amp;x=24.552845528455&amp;y=0&amp;cropw=47.317073170732&amp;croph=100&amp;width=291&amp;height=346&amp;compression=92) was the man that found the equipment. He remembers very well what he and his wife saw 49 years ago.

&gt;My wife and I was going to our cabin in Vassfaret. We started around 10-11am, as usual. When we passed Trytetjern, we saw a man that was sitting and enjoying himself. We drove past, but noticed that he had a camping table with a tablecloth, and a thermos. We saw it since we drove slowly past.

The same evening, the couple drove past again. The man was gone, but the camping equipment was still there.

&gt;Where had he gone? Why did he not bring his things? He had obviously been in a hurry, or had forgotten. But you don't forget things like that. It was so strange, which is why I notified the sheriff

Another observation was also made. The same weekend as the first observation, a business associate of Anker had spotted Anker on a [stretch of road between Hedalen and Nesbyen](https://imgur.com/a/VZQGB1V). They had seen Anker on this stretch of road wearing a blue coat. The nephew says that Anker had a coat like that, which he used when he fixed his car. He considers this a certain observation. In the documents in the Norwegian State Archive, it doesn't say if the witness was questioned, or where on this road he was observed.

**The search**

After the camping equipment was found, the criminal department asks the sheriff to search the area. The sheriff and his officers drives into the mountains and trawls the many mountain roads. They find nothing. No reports of an abandoned car. The sheriff sends a report to the Oslo police, where he says that it's impossible that the car has ended up in [Trytetjern](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14334617.jpg?imageId=14334617&amp;x=19.120287253142&amp;y=22.996515679443&amp;cropw=52.333931777379&amp;croph=57.142857142857&amp;width=583&amp;height=329&amp;compression=92), as the water is too shallow to hide a car.

After a new wanted notice is sent out after a few months, with no results, William Anker Lie is declared deceased by the court, and the case is closed.

**49 years later**

Åsted Norge is a detective show in Norway, which is well known for its ability to solve old cases. They started investigating this case in November 2019. Since Trytetjern was ruled out, it was the last place Åsted Norge looked. In September 2021, [Åsted Norge conducted a search](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/14360237.jpg?imageId=14360237&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;cropw=99.488054607509&amp;croph=100&amp;width=583&amp;height=330&amp;compression=92) with a special built sonar and an underwater drone. The sonar detected an object and they investigated with the drone. 8 meters under the surface, [they found a car](https://imgur.com/a/jR4UzNr) \[[PIC 2\]](https://imengine.public.prod.agp.infomaker.io/?uuid=e0c47dc2-8e7b-5805-bf0f-c7550c9a732b&amp;function=hardcrop&amp;type=preview&amp;source=false&amp;q=75&amp;width=1200&amp;height=675) with the license number DA 14027, laying vertically with the front part down into the mud in the seabed.

While Åsted Norge's detectives, camera crew and Anker's nephew Trond were listening in on the radio call between the diver and the surface crew, they hear the words ""We've found bones"". The remains were sent to be examined at Oslo Hospital. They were confirmed to be the remains of William Anker Lie.

Details of the case: 

•Ian is a Navy veteran.  

•Ian lived with a friend / roommate in the 2300 block of 57th Lane in Boone, and also lived part time in Conroe, Texas. He had moved to Colorado in the summer of 2016 after he was laid off from his job in TX, and got a job on a marijuana farm there.  I believe he grew up in the area of Conroe, Texas, and still has extended family there. 

•The only belongings that disappeared with Ian were the clothes he was wearing, his phone, his keys, his wallet and his gun. The day before he went missing, he had bought groceries, and had gotten in touch with his landlord in Texas to say he'd pay the monthly rent when he returned. Ian was supposed to fly to Texas on January 4, but the flight was  canceled due to bad weather.  

•The following below was posted on a Facebook page called “Help Find Ian Willcoxon” on March 11, 2018… There are a few more details around his disappearance in this particular post.  It appears this page is managed by a family member of Ian’s.  It’s also worth nothing that this post from the Facebook page indicates Ian went missing from Pueblo instead of Boone.  The town of Boone is located within Pueblo county though.  

“Ian is still missing. He went missing January 4th 2017. In Pueblo, Colorado. He does not have either of his vehicles. His last contact was a text at 10am on the 4th. His phone died the night after he went missing. He was supposed to be coming back to his rental home in Conroe TX on the 4th. His flight was cancelled due to weather conditions, and he never rescheduled. We have an idea of what he was wearing based on what he was wearing the day before. He was a creature of habit wore the same shoes and jacket alot. Carhartt light brown jacket and grey and white sneakers with light jeans. The property he was living at in Pueblo had nothing to suggest foul play only thing missing was his phone jacket and shoes.”

•I took a quick look back at what the weather was like on January 4, 2017 in the Pueblo, Colorado area.  It was very cold- the high was 27 degrees.  Snow showers were in the Pueblo area on Jan 5 &amp; 6. The weather history for Denver shows January 4 was extremely cold/ snowy. I assume his flight home that was canceled was departing out of Denver.  Boone is about 150 miles south of Denver International Airport. 

•I also spent some time trying to find any information on Ian’s friend he was living with in Boone, but wasn’t able to find anything.  I’d certainly hope that person was interviewed in great detail by LE.  

•I  tried to see if I could narrow down which marijuana farm he was working for at the time he went missing , but there are several different ones located in Boone, and probably quite a few within a 30 mile radius of the area. 

•There are a couple of social media pages that were set up to help find Ian &amp; get information out about his disappearance.  They seem to be updated periodically; unfortunately there just hasn’t been any significant new information on this case.  I wasn’t able to find any social media pages that may have been Ian’s own personal pages (other than a really old Pinterest page). 

•My thoughts on this case at this point are:

A.  The roommate/ friend is somehow involved. The lack of any public details on this person seems like a red flag.   It’s also worth noting that police have stated that they think someone in the Pueblo area knows more about this case.  (2019 KKTV news article link above)

B.  Somehow, Ian got confused/ disoriented, went outside on foot, succumbed to the elements, and just hasn’t been found yet.  

C.  I know that it is thought that he had his gun when he went missing, but without more information, I would not want to speculate that he took his own life.  Based on the available information, there is nothing to suggest that he was struggling with depression or thoughts of self harm. I also think that given his military background and lifestyle, it might have been totally typical behavior for him to carry his gun on a regular basis. 

D. Ultimately, as with all cases like this, I would like to hope he’s alive and well somewhere, and just decided for some reason that he needed a fresh start in life &amp; cut off contact with people from his past. Highly unlikely, I know.  

Thank you for reading my write up. Sending out lots of hope that this case can be resolved someday soon.",Missing from Colorado: Ian Kirk Willcoxen
521,Philodemus1984,[],1637350351,"A few news sources have just reported an update in the search for Jimmy Hoffa’s body. This has raised hope that the nearly 50 year old mystery will finally be resolved. Here’s a few sources:

https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/11/19/jimmy-hoffa-search-new-jersey-landfill/?amp

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna6137

A brief synopsis, taken mostly from the first source linked above: The search to find the remains of former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa has apparently led the FBI to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in New Jersey.

On October 25th and 26th, FBI personnel from the Newark and Detroit field offices completed the survey of the site and that data is currently being analyzed. There’s no indication whether anything was removed.

Dan Moldea, a journalist who has written extensively about the Hoffa mystery, said he was contacted by the FBI in September 2020 after interviewing the son of a key figure.

“I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” Moldea told the AP, referring to the FBI visit in October.

Hoffa’s disappearance has been unsolved for more than 45 years. He was last seen on July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit.

The latest effort appears to be tied to interviews given by a man named Frank Cappola, who was a teenager in the 1970s. He said he worked at the old PJP Landfill in Jersey City with his father, Paul Cappola.

Cappola said his dying father in 2008 explained how Hoffa’s body was delivered to the landfill in 1975, placed in a steel drum and buried with other barrels, bricks and dirt, according to Moldea.

Paul Cappola, worried that police might be watching that day, dug a hole on New Jersey state property, about 100 yards from the landfill, and dumped the unmarked barrel there, Moldea said Friday.

“Then he put 15 to 30 steel drums on top of it, which were filled with toxic adhesives, and bulldozed the area flat,” Moldea said.

Frank Cappola spoke to Fox Nation and Moldea before he died in 2020 and signed a document with his father’s detailed story.

“I’ve pushed all my chips in on this thing. I believe that we’ve got it,” Moldea told the AP. “Certainly the FBI is taking this seriously… This is wonderful, on the verge of total and complete vindication for their 46-year investigation. I’m hopeful they succeed.”

I haven’t followed the Hoffa investigation closely so I can’t say whether this update is of much significance. Still, I thought the news might be of some interest to people here.",Search for Jimmy Hoffa’s body leads FBI to New Jersey landfill

**John Lindberg Scott, born May 6, 1950 was just 27 years old when he died in a single-vehicle car crash west of Delafield in 1977. At the time, he was being pursued by a Waukesha County Sheriff’s deputy for speeding. The car he was driving had been stolen from Gurnee, Illinois.**

**In October 2019 Deputy Medical Examiner Kathryn Dougherty brought the case of Delafield John Doe 1977 to the DDP. After a DNA sample was sequenced to produce a profile for upload to GEDmatch and FTDNA, the genealogists began their work in mid-2020 on what proved to be a difficult case. The DDP team was able to offer some initial direction, and then continued to update Dougherty with potential surnames to provide her with leads. Dougherty zeroed in on Mr. Scott earlier this year and eventually located a marriage record that provided her a specific candidate. DNA from John Scott’s sister, Jean Nunn, confirmed the correct identity.**",Delafield John Doe 1977--Identified!
524,Frequent_Swordfish59,[],1637345201,"#  Who is Sofia Juarez? 

Sofia Lucerno Juarez was born February 5, 1998. She loved to play with Barbie dolls, enjoyed cartoons, and put makeup on at the time of her disappearance. Her favorite food was hamburgers from Burger King. She was shy by nature and wasn’t prone to wander off by herself. She was living with her mother, grandmother, and several aunts and uncles in the 100 block of E. 15 Avenue, Washington. She had never met her father. 

# Her disappearance 

She was playing with her brother in her bedroom between 8:15 and 9:15 pm, the day before her fifth birthday, which she was very excited about. Sofia was last seen when she told her mother, Maria  Juarez, that she was going to the store. Her mother gave her a dollar to spend and assumed she was going with Sofia’s grandmother’s boyfriend. She did not get into the car and the boyfriend went without her. No one saw her leave the house.   
The boyfriend bought milk and made a call on a payphone to relatives in Mexico before returning home from the store at 9:45 pm, he said Sofia had not gone with him, and authorities were alerted. Police arrived within three minutes of receiving the call about Sofia’s disappearance. The boyfriend was cleared as a suspect. It’s believed she was trying to follow him. 

Her disappearance was treated as an abduction from the start and an Amber Alert was issued but was canceled after 36 hours after she hadn’t been located. It was the first time an Amber Alert was issued in the state of Washington. 

# Aftermath 

Family members, friends and others were located and investigated. Over 150 sex offenders living in Kennewick or outside the immediate area was either researched, contacted or investigated. Her father was contacted and was cooperative and was ruled out as a suspect within 48 hours of her disappearance. 

Extensive searches produced little evidentiary value. A pair of overalls and a pair of little girl’s shoes was found in the area, but neither belonged to her. Nothing else has been located 

A candlelight vigil was held for Sofia on February 11, 2003. The vigil began at the Juarez home and ended at St. Joseph’s Church. The public memorial in front of Sofia’s home was removed after three weeks by her family. 

**Witness accounts and leads** 

A ten-year-old relative who also lived in the home stated he saw her walking down the driveway with a man dressed in a black sweatshirt, black pants and black shoes. This sighting hasn't been confirmed. 

Over 144 out-of-area reported sightings of Sofia were investigated. 

Three residences in Kennewick and Burbank were searched by police with police dogs on February 8. They belonged to the mother of murderer Jeremy Vargas Sagastegui who killed three people on November 19, 1995. He was executed on October 13, 1998. His mother objected to the police search and claimed detectives were attempting to pressure her and her sons into admitting to an attack on Juarez. A fourth home was searched three days later after a man had made a suspicious comment about the disappearance in a sexually-explicit phone call to a stranger. It was determined he had no connection to the case but he was charged with telephone harassment. 

Authorities announced in May 2003 that they were looking for a mid-nineties model full sized faded orange van with a license plate which contained a double J in the number. The van’s driver was a Caucasian male with a thick blonde beard, between 35 and 40 years old. The car was spotted in the area around the time of Sofia’s disappearance. It’s unknown if the car has a connection to the case. 

In August, 2006, pieces of a skull were discovered by a farmer in a field south of Ritzville after a fire had destroyed a patch of weeds. The field had been searched in 2003 after Sofia’s disappearance and in 2004 after the disappearance of 11-year-old Cody Haynes. The remains were determined to be at least 600 years old in 2007 after radiocarbon dating. DNA testing had been inconclusive. 

In 2011, the lead investigator told the media he was working on a tip about a teenager named “Sofia Juarez” of a similar age who was found on Facebook living in Long Beach, California. It was found she wasn’t the missing Sofia Juarez. 

Investigators said in 2021 that a “highly credible” witness saw a girl matching her description walking down a sidewalk on south Washington Street near east 15th Avenue between 8 and 9:15 pm the day she went missing. The witness stated a person led the girl away. An occupied van was stopped on a nearby side street. The van was described as a light blue, silver or gray late 1970’s or early 1980’s full sized panel van and appeared to be a work type van of the type painters or contractors used. The description of the possible suspect was later released. The suspect was described as a hispanic boy between 11 and 14 years old, with short, wavy dark-colored hair, about five feet tall, a “baby face” and large hands. He took the girl by the hand and led her towards the van, laughing as she cried. 

Over 225 leads have been provided to the police about illicit drug users who had accidently hit Sofia with a vehicle, transporting her from the scene to a remote location where she was killed and buried. Various names and vehicle descriptions have been provided. Investigation into the leads continues.  

Maria Juarez believed Sofia had been kidnapped by someone she knew and trusted. She passed away in January 2009 aged 26 of natural causes (stated as medical complications on Wikipedia) She was cremated and her funerary procession carried her ashes the same route as Sofia’s candlelight vigil. Maria Juarez gave birth to a child in mid-2008. According to statements in the media after her death, her family stated she had never given up hope that Sofia would eventually be found.

Authorities on Friday morning[ identified the Coatesville, Pennsylvania, teenager](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/2021/11/tiger-lady-found-slain-in-1991-now-identified-as-missing-pa-teen-prosecutor-says.html) whose remains were found 30 years ago at a rest stop off Interstate 80 in Knowlton Township.

Wendy Louise Baker, 16, who became know as “Tiger Lady” due to the tattoo of a Bengal tiger on her left calf, was discovered by hunters on Oct. 26, 1991, in a wooded area near mile marker 0.6, not far from the Pennsylvania border. Her death was ruled a homicide.

Authorities based the identification on family dna obtained from a bone of her remains and one of the on line databases that allow families to submit DNA and police to search / match for unidentified bodies.  They were able to track her family back to her grand parents. 

They are still treating the case as a homicide and are asking the public for any information that any may have regarding the death. 

While I am glad they id'd her - it is still unclear if Wendy was ever reported as missing or if the police have any suspects in her murder. 

Hopefully returning her name will allow her family closure and maybe trigger something in someone's memory that will help police eventually find her killer.

Warren County Prosecutor Jim Pfeiffer was joined at a news conference about 11:15 a.m. at Good Will Fire Company in Belvidere by representatives of the New Jersey State Police Cold Case Unit, the state police Office of Forensic Sciences, the Center for Human Identification, BODE Technologies and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Pfeiffer said it was a ”great honor” that he and all the investigators involved were able to “bring that person home to their family”, provide closure to the family and allow for burial.

“We wouldn’t be here without science and technology,” which make the impossible possible, Pfeiffer said.

When Pfeiffer took office in 2019, he sought to review cold cases and [hopefully solve two of the county’s enduring mysteries](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/2020/11/princess-doe-tiger-lady-and-a-new-effort-to-learn-who-they-really-were.html) — the identify of Tiger Lady and that of Princess Doe, who was found beaten to death on July 15, 1982, in Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown.

The goal was to hire a company to use [investigative genetic genealogy](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/news/2020/11/this-led-police-to-john-sipos-51-years-after-mary-scotts-killing-so-what-is-investigative-genetic-genealogy-outside-of-successful.html) to compare DNA in criminal cases to large public DNA databases and then use genealogy to work toward an identification. The hope was to identify a family member and work from there, something that worked in the Tiger Lady case and could still lead to the identity of Princess Doe.

DNA was extracted from a small piece of one of Baker’s bones and, using online two public genealogy databases that allow John Doe searches and to which people can upload their DNA, BODE Technology was able to identify several family members and create a family tree dating back to Baker’s grandparents, a company representative said.

Baker spent much of her time in the area near her hometown but also had been in Bradenton, Florida, and had visited California, Pfeiffer said.

The killing remains under investigation.

“We need someone to come forward with the information we need to solve this murder,” Pfeiffer said.",Tiger Lady Doe Identified - Partially Solved

A final-year Polytechnic student, Jackson Chua &amp; his family stayed in Sengkang. While he was largely involved in project work at school, he still made an effort to come back home each day to take care of his younger siblings.

The day before he went missing, Jackson was hanging out with his usual group of friends for dinner, but he left early, saying he needed to hand some materials over to his group project mates. However, later that night, one of the friends received a call from him, asking what was their group's plans. Little did any of them know, but that night was the last time they would have seen or spoken with Jackson.

On 28 February 1999, the day went by as normal. Around the afternoon, Jackson left the house, saying he was going to step outside of the house to test out a new bus route, and that he would be back home for dinner. Interestingly, it cannot be ascertained whether or not he did indeed take the bus route that he said he was going to try. But what was certain was that he left home that day and never returned.

When Jackson failed to return home that evening, Jackson's mother started getting worried, especially since he had ascertained he would be home to eat. Multiple phone calls &amp; pager messages were sent but all went unanswered. Jackson's father had even went to the police the next morning, but was advised to wait, as it had not passed 24 hours between Jackson's last known contact &amp; his attempted report. Jackson also failed to show up for his term test later that day and it was then that Jackson was officially declared missing.

**The Search &amp; Investigations**

Jackson's family put up missing persons posters at every bus stop which was covered by the route that he had said he was going to try, as well as around the neighbourhood his favourite hangouts. Notices were placed in the local newspapers, in hopes that someone knew his whereabouts would contact the family. Jackson's mother would try to page or call him every day, but they were all in vain. She also monitored his bank account each day, but the funds inside remained untouched. His room was also searched in hope of finding some clue of his disappearance, but nothing unusual turned up.

Police investigators went through Jackson's computer &amp; belongings. It was at this point that his family and friends that an unknown part of his life was discovered, that he was actively engaged in chatting on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Besides the search, the police obtained a list of telephone numbers from the phone company. Among the numbers, there were 2 which Jackson's family were not familiar with, which the police then focused their efforts on. 

The first number was traced to a university student, who admitted to meeting Jackson on the IRC, however further questioning revealed he had nothing to do with the disappearance. The second number was traced to a man living in Toa Payoh. His flat was searched but he denied knowing Jackson, only confessing to knowing him through the IRC when the police search revealed Jackson's mobile number was written in a diary. The police questioned him, but failed to bring up anything conclusive on him being connected to the disappearance.

With both leads turning up a dead end, the police subsequently stopped their investigations on them. Unfortunately, besides those 2 people, nobody else that Jackson was chatting with in the IRC was identified/brought up for questioning. However, the family strongly believes that his IRC involvement was responsible for his disappearance, saying that it was unlikely that he had a reason to run away from home or fall victim to a random robbery/kidnapping, on the basis that they were not well-to-do and that his bank account funds were untouched.

**The Unexplained**

In the same year of the disappearance, Jackson's family would receive anonymous calls following the same pattern. They would always be in 3s, and the caller remained silent. Also, he/she was never the first to hang up, often, the family hung up after trying to get the caller to say something. The family's phone had a Caller ID, and the numbers that the calls were made from were noted in hopes that they would be a lead to locating Jackson. They had even managed to locate one of the phone numbers where the calls were made from, however the man claimed he did not recall whether he had met Jackson.

While the caller was never truly identified, another unexplained occurrence would happen in 2002, 3 years after his disappearance. A neighbour had recently moved in to the unit facing the Jackson's family's unit and one night, approximately around 2am, she spotted a man that had initially started walking towards her flat, however changed direction and started walking towards the Jackson's family's unit. The neighbour subsequently claimed that the man 'stood around the door for 20 minutes, but didn't go in'. She also did not recognize that man as being any of her neighbours.

When shown a photo of Jackson by his mother, the neighbour did positively identify that the man she saw was Jackson, saying that she managed to ID him because he had initially approached towards her flat &amp; had spent a fair amount of time loitering around, allowing her to identify. However, his family questioned if the man was indeed Jackson, saying that if it indeed was him, why did he not make any effort to go into the house and just stand outside for so long? Regardless of his identity, the man never returned to the flat again.

**The Trail Goes Cold**

As the years went by, the trail went cold, however while Jackson's family have tried to move on, they still held out hope that their child was still alive out there. 

With the following information, what do you think happened to Jackson? Is there any reasonable explanation for the unexplained occurrences?

Esra lived in Clondalkin, Dublin at the time of her disappearance, with her husband and her son but had originally lived in London. Esra was reluctant to move at first, not wanting to leave her friends and family at home. Esra’s mother and mother-in-law were due to fly over to Ireland to visit Esra the week after she disappeared. 

A neighbour saw Esra on 22 February taking out some rubbish, she told the neighbour that she was cleaning up the house in preparation for her mother and mother-in-law’s visit. 

On 23 February 2011, Esra left her home in her car at around 7am to go to the shop for some things. Her husband wanted to use the car to go to work and then to the gym afterwards so Esra wanted to pop to the shop in the morning so she wouldn’t have to leave the house later in the day. Her car was seen at the roundabout by her home at 07:50, a journey which should have taken only 4 minutes. When she didn’t return home, her husband grew worried and contacted her family in England, wondering if they had heard anything from her throughout the day. The had not, so her husband contacted the police. 

Police discovered that Esra’s car had been found parked in Bray, a coastal town around 30km from her home in Clondalkin. Esra’s wallet was found in the boot (trunk) of her car. There were no reported sightings of Esra. The area was searched, including Bray Head, a hill popular with hillwalkers, but nothing was found. 

Footage emerged of Esra’s car, a grey Renault Twingo, driving erratically down Strand road in Bray, towards the car park. The car has a near collision with a Skoda Octavia. Unfortunately, the footage was too grainy to make out who was driving the car, or how many people were in the car. 

While hanging up posters in an area of shops near her home in Clondalkin, the owner of a chip shop approached Berna. He handed her Esra’s car keys, which had been handed in to the shop some months before. There was a picture of Esra and her son on the keychain. They had been handed in to the shop in December 2011. 

Suicide has been a theory in this case as Esra’s father had recently passed away. I believe that somebody may have abducted Esra on her way to the shop that morning. It’s possible that as she was driving, someone flagged her down. Perhaps they locked Esra in the boot, which may explain why her wallet was found there. I would never put my wallet in the boot if I was just popping to the shop. 

I remember seeing Esra’s poster quite a few years ago in Bray and the case has stuck with me ever since. I hope her family get answers one day. Also, this is my first write up so please forgive me if it is a bit of a mess!

&gt;**FBI  agents have searched a plot of land in the US state of New Jersey after  a deathbed confession renewed hope of solving union boss Jimmy Hoffa's  disappearance 50 years ago.**   
&gt;  
&gt;For decades, Hoffa was one of America's most powerful labour organisers.  
&gt;  
&gt;But in 1975 he suddenly disappeared and his body has never been recovered.   
&gt;  
&gt;Investigators  recently received a tip that a former worker on a landfill site in  Jersey City had said that his father told him he had buried Hoffa's  body.   
&gt;  
&gt;His disappearance had long been linked with the American Mafia, with whom Hoffa had a turbulent relationship.   
&gt;  
&gt;According  to the New York Times, landfill worker Frank Cappola, who died in March  2020, told a friend that his father had confessed to him that he had  been ordered by a gang of unidentified men to bury Hoffa's body  underground in a steel drum.  
&gt;  
&gt;Agents  bearing search warrants arrived at a former landfill site and conducted  a survey on 25 and 26 October. A spokesperson for the FBI told the  newspaper that data was currently being analysed.

529,BottledApple,[],1637320768,"I know we've had a few threads since the investigation got suddenly revamped but I just thought it would be a useful thing to discuss the tactics the police in NSW are and have used so far.

Here's the basics - William Tyrrell is an Australian boy who disappeared at the age of three from Kendall in New South Wales on 12 September 2014. William had been playing at his foster grandmother's house with his sister, and was wearing a [s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man)pider man suit at the time of his disappearance For the first seven years of the investigation, Tyrrell was believed to have been [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping)bducted.

 On 12 September 2016, a reward of A$1 million was offered for the recovery of Tyrrell and does not require the arrest, charging or conviction of any person or persons.

  
On 15 November 2021, after receiving new evidence, NSW police renewed the search for Tyrrell in three areas surrounding Kendall, assuming that they were searching for human remains.

  
On 17 November 2021, major media reported that Tyrrell's foster mother and now-deceased foster grandmother were being treated as persons of interest in his disappearance. The police began investigating the possibility of a fall from a balcony on the property.

First of all, I've never seen an investigation being reopened which shares quite this much information. Firstly, the sharing of the fact that the Foster Mother is the main person of interest and that was shared with no arrest or anything.

Yes, she had been subject to an AVO (apprehended violence order) because a child had allegedly been injured in her care...her husband too. 

But to say she's the main person of interest in William's disappearance after there NEVER having been anything said before is highly unusual no?

THEN we have the information given that they're looking at the ""possibility William fell from the balcony"" of the Foster Gran's home that morning

WHY would they share this? It's not something they're saying is fact...they're saying it's something they're looking at...they never usually share things like that.

Then we have the constant sharing of finds and non-finds during the dig in nearby bushland...first some bits of red fabric (looked more like string) and today, as they drain the creek, they've shared that they've found a faded piece of [blue fabric](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/19/william-tyrrell-search-police-drain-creek-and-find-light-blue-piece-of-fabric) there...the creek is the place any remains from the area they've been digging would be washed into...that's why they've drained that area.

But why are they telling these things to the press? They are telling things to the waiting press...like ""Oh we've found something but it's nothing...we've discounted it"" and so on.

Isn't all this weird? I've literally never seen anything like it? Is there any case anyone else can mention that has shared this amount of detail?",Can we discuss he highly unusual tactics of the current investigation into the disappearance of William Tyrrell?
530,Puzzleworth,[],1637311534,"Eighty years ago today, in 1941, the Australian Navy ship HMAS *Sydney* sank off the western coast of Australia. Eleven weeks later, a life raft containing the body of a sailor washed ashore. For eighty years, the young man was known only as ""Australia's Unknown Sailor,"" but as the Australian War Memorial announced today, modern genetic genealogy has given back the name he had in life: Able Seaman **Thomas Welsby Clark**, of Brisbane. He was 21 years old.


# Background


On November 19, 1941, the Royal Australian Navy cruiser HMAS *Sydney* was on a relatively leisurely journey. She had been en route to her home port of Fremantle, WA, that day, after escorting a troop transport to the Sunda Strait. But that afternoon, off of Carnarvon, she unexpectedly encountered another ship. Although the vessel appeared to be a merchanteer, the Sydney's captain, Joseph Burnett, was suspicious. Very few ships were permitted to be there at the time. After repeated signal attempts from the *Sydney*, the other ship identified itself as a Dutch merchant vessel, the *Straat Malakka*. But something was wrong. It did not show the ship's secret signal--nor was the *Straat* even allowed to be there in the first place. Faced with a possible enemy assault, Captain Burnett ordered the *Sydney* to intercept. 

As the *Sydney* pulled up alongside to investigate, the other ship dropped its ruse. The ""merchant ship"" was actually the German *Kormoran*, a merchant raider designed to sneak up on enemy vessels and sink them at close range with powerful bursts of cannon fire. The deception became the *Sydney*'s undoing. Although she was one of the finest ships in the Australian Naval fleet, she was not prepared for a sneak attack. The battle was over after just thirty minutes. Almost all the *Sydney*'s 645-man crew was killed in the fighting. With no one to stand at the helm, the cruiser went adrift until she finally sank a few hours later. The *Kormoran* was more lucky. The majority of the 81 deaths among the Germans were from the sinking of a faulty lifeboat. (The remaining 318 crewmembers were taken prisoner by Australia)

# Locating the body

Eleven weeks later and over a thousand miles away, something odd was spotted off the coast of Christmas Island. Local authorities, wary of Japanese submarines, sent out a pilot boat to investigate. Instead of an enemy invasion, the boat found a life raft bobbing in the surf. Inside was the body of a young man. Quickly, they brought the raft in to port and called a local doctor to examine their find.

(Note: there are very few sources for the history surrounding this part, and most is recollected decades later, as Japanese forces later occupied Christmas Island and destroyed all records) 

Upon examination, the body in the boat was determined to be a young man of ""Caucasoid"" descent. He had died at sea some weeks before being found. Almost all the flesh of the man's upper body was gone post-mortem, making further identification impossible. However, a local man later recalled that the body had ""almost perfect teeth."" 

Also available were some few personal effects. The life raft was a ""Carley float,"" made in Australia and carried by RAN ships. The body was clad in a white or blue boiler suit, which was held together with press studs instead of the traditional buttons. Descriptions of the shoes vary; some witnesses claim the body had boots on and others remember canvas boat-shoes, but most agree the shoes had some sort of logo involving a crown. He had no dog tags or identification. 

With no way for authorities to find his next of kin, the man was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in Christmas Island's cemetery. And there he laid for the next sixty years. By the 1990s, the Christmas Island man was the subject of much activism, including by one Ted McGowan, whose brother Thomas had perished on the *Sydney*. He had learned of the mystery body in a book about the disaster. One detail in particular, of the man's ""perfect teeth"", especially stood out to Mr. McGowan as being like his brother. In 2006, the ""Christmas Island Man"" was exhumed following years of attempts and was examined with modern science. 

The results were intriguing. The man had been roughly 22-31 years old and tall for the time, at between 168.2 centimetres (5'6) and 187.8 centimetres (~6'2) tall, was right-handed, and wore a size-11 shoe. His ankle joints showed he had often squatted instead of sitting. He had died from a skull fracture, likely caused by a German shell exploding (a piece of shrapnel was lodged in his forehead bone but would not have caused death by itself) Unlike his ""perfect teeth"" in memory, the man had several gold fillings and was missing two teeth. (Between this and later DNA comparison, Thomas McGowan was ruled out as being Christmas Island Man) Isotopic testing showed he had grown up on the eastern coast of Australia, eating a diet rich in marine life. His genetic phenotype showed he was white, with red hair, blue eyes, and very pale skin.

Using dental records, investigators narrowed his identity down to about 50 members of the *Sydney*'s crew. For a few months, he was even tentatively identified as Norman Foster. But the real break came when the investigation tried something completely new--genetic genealogy. The man's DNA sample was loaded onto an ancestry website (likely GEDMatch though it hasn't been stated) and his family tree puzzled out through genetic matches. Eventually investigators landed on one name in particular. Two relatives of the man in question, a niece and a half-nephew, gave DNA for a direct confirmation.


# Identification


Today, November 19, 2021, eight decades to the day the HMAS *Sydney* sank, the Australian War Memorial announced that it had identified the sole located member of the ship's crew as Able Seaman Thomas Welsby Clark, age 21, of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. 

AB Thomas ""Tom"" Clark was born and raised in Queensland. He was the grandson of an pearl-industry giant, James Clark, and spent his youth working the oyster farms between terms at Slade School, outside of Brisbane. He was described as a good swimmer and yachter, who late became an accountant before joining the Australian Army Reserve and eventually the Navy. He had been assigned to the HMAS *Sydney* for just two-and-a-half months before it sank.

The identification of Tom Clark was confirmed through direct comparison with two of his close relatives: his niece Dr. Leigh Lehane and her half-brother. Although they did not directly remember their uncle, family stories say he met Leigh and even held her during his last visit to Brisbane, when she was just a month old.

Tom Clark was buried with full military honors in Geraldton War Cemetery. His grave, previously marked ""Australia's Unknown Sailor,"" will now be marked with a headstone bearing his true name and rank.

HMAS Sydney, an Australian light cruiser that had helped sink two Italian warships the year prior, had been tasked to patrol the shores of Western Australia.

To their surprise, they encountered a small merchant ship claiming to be the dutch vessel ""straat malaaka"". After a small few exchanges, the Sydney asked for the Dutch to reveal their secret call sign, to which the Dutch ship didn't give. All of a sudden, the ship lowered their Dutch flag and revealed a Nazi flag. It turned out to be a Nazi raider ship ""Kormoran"". The kormoran had sunk 11 small vessels prior to this fight. 

Torpedos and gunshells were exchanged, and after a gruelling long fight, the Sydney had sunk. Kormoran's captain, Theo Detmers, ordered the ship to be scuttled a few hours after the sinking of the Sydney. Kormoran's ""victory"" (i say this because both ships went down) was unexpected since the Sydney was a much larger, much more powerful vessel.

All 645 hands on the Sydney were lost. Making it the highest death toll for a ship lost with all hands during the Second world war. 20 Germans died in the fight; 62 died when their lifeboat sunk.

Three months after the sinking, a lifeboat containing the corpse of an Australian sailor was discovered on Christmas Island. 

No one knew his identity until almost 80 years later, when tests from his teeth matched the genetic material of his surviving descendants. He was revealed as 20-year-old  Thomas Welsby Clark. A man who had joined the ship four months prior to its sinking.

News sources claim he was trained as an accountant and both of his brothers served in the war.

#Background, Career and Controversy

Actress Oh In Hye was a South Korean actress born on January 4th 1984. She debuted in 2011 through the film _Sin of a Family_. That same year, she gained a certain level of notoriety after wearing a revealing dress to the Busan International Film Festival. While the dress would’ve been perceived as normal in the West, it was met with harsh scrutiny by the Korean entertainment industry (Korea, like most Asian countries, is quite conservative when it comes to showing skin. This was also 10 years ago and dress codes were stricter than they are now) There is speculation that this incident had In Hye black listed by many agencies as she didn’t land that many roles afterwards.

#YouTube Career

Oh In Hye launched a YouTube channel in 2019. Her channel was made up of skin care and “a day from my life” style videos. All her videos were numbered in ascending order like that of a tv show. Her final video was numbered 48. 

#The Final Video

There are some inconsistencies surrounding the final video In Hye uploaded prior to her demise. 

**48**

For starters, as I mentioned, all of In Hye’s videos are numbered. The final video was numbered 48. What’s confusing is that the penultimate video was video number 45. So, where are videos 46 and 47? Why did she skip those two videos? You’ll notice that the number 48 is a recurring theme in this mystery. 

**The Glitch**

In Oh In Hye’s final video, the video starts glitching at around the 01.50 mark. This glitch continues for around a minute. The glitch occurs as In Hye’s is combing her hair. The result is slightly disturbing as it appears as though she is repeatedly pointing to her neck with her comb. In the title of her video, In Hye mentions the glitch and apologizes for it. Therefore, it’s clear that she was aware of this before uploading it. Sources also state that In Hye edited her own videos. This means that she was aware of the glitch (that went on for a whole minute) and yet did not edit it out. 


#The Angel Number

Oh In Hye also has Korean subtitles on her videos. In the one before the last video (i.e video number 45) at the 04.08 mark, the subtitles read 84848484848484. During this scene, In Hye mentions that she was born in 1984, but it’s unclear why the subtitles are titled in that manner.

Further, during the glitch, the clock behind In Hye displays the time as 8.30. Many have even gone so far as to point out how 8 x 6 = 48. 

The number 48 also has a numerological significance that I think coincides with this story quite well. SunSigns.Org states that “by frequently appearing in your life, indicates that the guardian angels are signaling to you that a sequence of events is facing a closure shortly. It is also a message that you will be amply compensated for all the honest efforts you have put in.
The termination of the succession of events will open up a plethora of fresh openings and prospects in life. There is no need for any apprehension about material loss” 

I am not well versed in numerology and therefore, cannot interpret this accurately. However, the number 48 as an angel number seems to denote the ending of a chain of events. An ending that will give way to bliss. Was the frequent display of the number 48 (or some variation of the numbers 4 and 8) intentional? Did Oh In Hye believe that it was an angel number that “frequently appeared” in her life? 

#The Instagram Post

Oh In Hye’s last post on Instagram had a cryptic caption. It was posted just before her passing and seems accusatory in nature. YouTuber GRAZYTV gave a loose translation of this caption,

_”Everything is my fault and I don’t like blaming others….
It’s hard to give my heart to someone…
I am not drunk, my phone is not working properly.
You are watching this right? That called me just a piece of body. Asking me to forgive with just an I love you. This is criminal. I will show you and get you in trouble”_

The post was taken down just one hour after it was posted.


Oh In Hye passed away at the age of 36 of a speculated suicide. The details surrounding her death are extremely murky. I urge you all to watch GRAZYTV’s video on the topic. I will link that, along with another informative video, down below. 

In all of this, it is important to be respectful to the individual and not get too caught up with the theories. I hope In Hye rests in peace and is free from all her burdens. It’s despicable how she was shunned by an entire industry over a mere dress. I hope she is now at peace, away from her sufferings.

The Spokane Police Department will hold a press conference at 10 a.m. Friday to unveil the person responsible for Rogers’ death and to explain how they solved one of the oldest cold cases in the state of Washington. The police department will broadcast the conference live on Facebook.

Candice “Candy” Elaine Rogers, a Holmes Elementary School student, went missing the evening of March 6, 1959, while selling Camp Fire Girls mints near her 2106 1/2 W. Mission Ave. home.

Her body was found just over two weeks later March 22 about 3 1/2 miles northwest of Spokane Falls Community College under a pile of pine needles and boughs about 200 yards south of an abandoned rock quarry and 130 feet off Old Trails Road. The ensuing investigation determined she had been raped and strangled.

Among the evidence found was grape-smelling gum smeared on Rogers’ sweater and coat.

The gum was among an amount of evidence linking Rogers’ death to Hugh Bion Morse, a serial killer who murdered two Spokane women and nearly killed a third. Though Morse had a penchant for grape-flavored gum, however, DNA evidence that became available in 2001 indicated Morse didn’t assault Rogers.

Rogers was the daughter of Elaine and Carl Rogers Jr., who were divorced at the time of her disappearance. In June 1963, Carl Rogers killed himself with a revolver at a hotel in Walla Walla. He was 44.

Simone Pianetti was born on 7 February 1858. He was from a wealthy family that lived in a small village called Lavaggi, in the province of Bergamo. He was aggressive and hot-tempered – he once tried to shoot his father with a shotgun for issues regarding an inheritance, but he missed him – and at one point decided to emigrate to America hoping to find a better future, like many of his generations.

He went to New York and worked several jobs. He also began getting closer to the anarchist circles of the city. He then started an importing company with his friend Antonio Ferrari, but, during their activity, they encountered a lot of problems with the local mafia.

His character brought Pianetti to report the problem to the local police, an unusual thing at the time for the risks that came from doing it.

The report made the arrest of 10 unsuspected people possible, but his friend Antonio Ferrari paid with his life – he was killed by the Black Hand. Pianetti's life was at risk, he left the city and traveled with a false identity until he returned to his homeland.

&amp;#x200B;

***The return to Italy and the difficulties***

Upon returning to Italy, he found the same bigoted and hostile environment that he escaped from. But he also started to feel that there was hope for a change, thanks to the opening of a casino and the election of Bortolo Belotti, with whom Pianetti became a great friend since they shared the same disapproval of the catholic-conservative party, which was prevalent in the area.

He married Carlotta Marini and had 9 kids, and then opened an inn with her. While at first the business was successful, everything began to fall apart once the locals began to spread the word about Pianetti being an anticlerical anarchist. A total boycott followed, made also possible by the town's political authorities, and the inn was forced to close due to the complete lack of clients.

With the remaining money he decided to move to the near city of San Giovanni Bianco., to avoid the people that now despised him. He opened an electric mill there: an innovation for his era. But after a short time, people started talking about this one, too. They said that his flour brought curses and illness and began to call it ""The Devil's Flour"". This forced him to abandon the mill, casting him into total poverty.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Killings***

After losing everything, he began showing weird behaviors. He first told his friends the intention of committing suicide, then he started to talk with rage about the people that brought him to his downfall.

He decided to kill them and wrote their names on a list.

*First victim*

On the morning of 13 July 1914, he left the house with his shotgun and went to the Sentino valley. He waited for the doctor Domenico Morali to arrive (he walked there often to go to his hunting spot) while hiding in a bush.  For Pianetti the doctor was guilty of not curing properly his son Aristide, that died some time prior. The doctor was shot two times and died.

*Second and third victims*

Then Pianetti proceeded to go to a little town called Camerata, looking for the mayor Cristoforo Manzoni. He could not find him, so he killed the city clerk instead (for Pianetti guilty of issuing the closure notice on the tavern) and his daughter Valeria that was next to him.

Fourth victim

The next victim was the shoemaker and justice of the peace Giovanni Ghilardi, killed for being his political opponent.

*Fifth and sixth victims*

The fifth victim was priest don Camillo Filippi; Pianetti thought that the inn’s closing was also his fault. He then proceeded to kill his sixth victim, Giuseppe Giupponi; his fault was not granting Pianetti access to water from a fountain.

*Seventh and final victim*

Pianetti traveled through the woods and arrived in the village of Pianca, looking for the innkeeper Pietro Bottani, but did not find him. Unsuccessful, he went to Cantalto and killed Caterina Milesi, a woman that didn't pay her debts to Pianetti.

After his last killing, he encountered a group of coalmen that offered him some food.

He then walked away, vanishing in the Cancervo mountain, an area he knew well.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Escape***

The news about the massacre soon spread all around the valley: the streets of San Giovanni Bianco were completely empty; people were all hiding in their homes, never leaving them. The police began to keep an eye on everyone that managed to escape from Simone Pianetti and those who had had problems with him and started to look for him. On the evening of 14 July, some policeman and forest rangers found him, and a firefight began between them and the fugitive; no one was injured but Pianetti was not caught and ran away.

On 16 July 1914, senator Bortolo Belotti arrived in town, and, at the same time, a bounty of 1.000 lire was placed on Simone Pianetti's head. The next day Simone met a woman, Giacomina Giupponi, with whom exchanged his gun for some food. Meanwhile, in the surrounding area, the search for him intensified, with a lot of volunteers joining (many of whom were from the victims’ families), 170 soldiers, and 40 policemen.

But even so, Pianetti could manage to vanish with more than 300 people looking for him. At the same time, public opinion started to take different positions on the case.  The local press started to talk about the different opinions spreading within the population, worrying about people condoning the culprit.

But people started to see Pianetti as a savior, so much that on the city walls slogans praising him began to appear.

Meanwhile, the search yielded no results, so much that on 29 July 1914 Bergamo's prefect added 5000 lire to the bounty on the head of the criminal, but even this didn't help at all. On 27 July authorities granted Simone's son, Nino, the permit to meet his father in the mountains to try to convince him to turn himself in. The boy, after finding his father, gave the latter two letters written by his wife and his best friend, Bortolo Belotti, that both encouraged him to surrender to the authorities.

On the other hand, Simone, after having written a heartbreaking letter to his wife, told his son « They will never find me, neither living nor dead. ». That moment, reported by all the papers at the time, was in fact the last confirmed sighting of Pianetti.

During his escape he could rely on the help of herders and coalmen: they saw him as a sort of vigilante, offering him food and a place to rest. Two brothers were convicted for helping him by letting him stay in their hut and lying to the police to cover him.

The elusiveness of the fugitive on the run, helped by the international events that were announcing the start of the First World War in Italy, favored the interruption of the search for him. In the meantime, justice continued its course: on 25 May 1915 the trial against Simone Pianetti, accused in absentia, ended at the Assize Court of Bergamo. The sentence of life imprisonment was accompanied by five years of continuous cellular segregation, the interdiction from public offices, the loss of parental authority and marital authority, as well as the legal interdiction with consequent cancellation of the will signed by him. A new arrest order was also issued against the condemned.

&amp;#x200B;

***Hypothesis On The Disappearance***

The body of Simone Pianetti was never found there are numerous hypotheses regarding his fate. The thesis provided by the family is that their relative died between the peaks of the Cancervo and Venturosa mountains a few days after the meeting with their son Nino. This version, advocated by the same son, has never convinced the inhabitants of the area, and was probably provided in order to calm the minds and allow a bit of peace to the relatives.

However, numerous and conflicting rumors indicate the fugitive being in the American continent. To support this hypothesis there are some letters found, as well as the testimony of Domenica Milesi.

The woman, originally from San Giovanni Bianco, who had known Pianetti because of their common political affiliation, claimed to have met him in Ciudad Bolívar, a Venezuelan city to which she had emigrated with her husband.

She told she met the fugitive through a Sicilian trader residing in Pittsburgh who, having arrived in Venezuela for business, told her that he had made acquaintance with one of his countrymen, a certain Pianetti. The woman then asked to be able to get in touch with that person: after less than a month Pianetti, according to the woman's testimony, went to her.

He gave her some letters and some money to send to his family in Italy, saying that he managed to escape, first hiding among the bundles of wood carried by a cart, and then going, through the offices of a very influential person in the area, to the visa office of the Bergamo police station, which provided him with a passport with false personal details with which he could board a ship bound for North America.

Pianetti would therefore have been helped by the authorities themselves, given the sympathy, he received from the lower classes of the population: his arrest could in fact provoke uncontrolled reactions, as well as increase his fame and legend. Another hypothesis argues that Pianetti instead emigrated, fleeing from Orobie towards Valtellina, thus reaching the canton of Grisons in Switzerland.

A few decades later, in 1943, some inhabitants of the area claimed to have met an elderly gentleman wandering between the Cancervo and Venturosa mountains, not far from the Cespedosio district. They had a quick exchange of words, from which emerged the true identity of Simone Pianetti, then over eighty, who was entertained especially with a woman of the same age, before disappearing again in the surrounding woods.

People also report that Nino Pianetti, in the meantime, had moved to Milan, confided to acquaintances that his father had actually emigrated to America and then returned with a false identity in Italy, where he spent his final years. His last domicile would have been in his son's home in Milan, where he would have died in 1952.

&amp;#x200B;

He is remembered in most of the towns of Val Brembana as a sort of vigilante, often referred to as a straightener of wrongs, a sort of elusive hero who opposed strong powers: in fact, the ""romantic"" aspect of the story prevails, leaving out the tragic and criminal side, so much so that the threat to “do as Pianetti” (in Bergamo dialect fa de Pianetti) is still being used.

On the morning of the 8th of January 2018 on the island of Guernsey, police and fire brigade attended a burning vehicle at Petit Bot.  They decided it wasn't a risk, and so left it to cool down.

However, on the 10th of January, Mikus Alps was reported missing.  The burnt out vehicle found on the 8th was registered to Alps, and when police returned to it, they noticed his body with a shotgun belonging to him in the front of the car.  His death had been caused by the shotgun.  Alps was a recreational drug user and there was MDMA, amphetamine and Butylone in his system.

Mikus Alps was 33 at the time of his death, and had moved to the island of Guernsey from Latvia at the age of 19.  He set up a business selling car parts in the rural parish of Torteval.  The business was struggling, and at the time of his death Alps owed £23,000 to creditors and owed his employees wages.

On the 7th of January, Alps spent the day at home.  In the evening he visited two friends.  One of them he gave a package, telling them they'd know what to do with it when the time was right.  It contained a ""sombre and reflective"" letter he had written.  When his friend asked if he was ok, Alps said ""yes, things are going to change"".  Alps had previously expressed suicidal thoughts, and had been struggling after a break up in 2015.

Alps' mobile placed him in the area of his business between 01.20 and 03.08 on the 8th of January.
At 02.46 he called a friend who later said they could hear foreign voices in the background, though police couldn't verify this.

At 03.29 Alps WhatsApp called a friend while in the area of Petit Bot.  The friend believed they heard someone else in the background, but wasn't certain.

At 04.09 Alps' phone signal was lost.

It could not be determined whether the gunshot wound that killed Mikus Alps was self-inflicted or inflicted by another person, and so there is an open verdict on his death.  There were also fractures to his arms, for which a cause could not be found.

Mikus Alps had connections to the Ukraine Volunteer Army and made trips to take supplies over to support them in their fight against Russian invaders.  Some of Alps' friends said he believed he was being followed by Russians prior to his death, though there is no evidence to support this.  Still, many believe Mikus Alps was killed because of his activism.

“Tiger Lady” Jane Doe (1991) was finally identified. As someone from New Jersey, this case has always stuck out to me. News articles indicate that “Tiger Lady” Jane Doe has been identified as a missing teenager from Coatesville, Pennsylvania. There is a “major announcement” being made tomorrow morning. 

For those unaware, here is a little background on the case: A badly decomposed young female’s remains were reported to the New Jersey State Police on October 26, 1991, on Interstate 80 in Knowlton Township, New Jersey. The female became known as “Tiger Lady” due to a large Bengal tiger tattoo on her left calf. I always thought it was rather odd that she was not identified based on this distinctive tattoo, however, some have speculated that she may not have had the tattoo when she disappeared (or maybe she kept it hidden from most people). It was determined that the manner of death was homicide, but more specifics are unknown.

Warren County Prosecutor James Pfeffier made it his “mission” when taking office last year to solve this case, so it is really cool to see it finally solved. It seems that the mystery was solved through a joint effort between James Pfeffier and the New Jersey State Police Cold Case Unit.

It’s incredible to see this mystery solved after so much time. This is one of the earliest true crime cases I remember reading and it has stuck with me. I am very curious to see what the press conference tomorrow holds, if they will name the teen, if they have any more indication as to how she died, if there are any suspects, etc.

I’m watching [The Sunshine Hotel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B008J0DQJ0/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r), a documentary about one of the last flophouses in NYC. I originally learned about The Sunshine Hotel from the [99% Invisible podcast](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-sunshine-hotel/).

The hotel’s manager, Nathan Smith, is an Army vet. He said he “went into the Army in September, 1954.” I’m assuming the following happened on December 25, 1954 and early December 26, 1954.

Smith was granted leave to go home for the holidays. But first, he had to work through Christmas Day on KP duty (kitchen duty). Nobody showed up, so they gave the food away. 

Even though he was surrounded by food (which was being given away), Smith “didn’t really eat” that day. When he got to the train station, he realized the next train wasn’t until midnight and he hasn’t “really” eaten all day. Because there were no restaurants in the train station, Smith went to the bus station and sat down at the counter.

“I’m sorry, sir, you can’t sit there,” the waitress said to Smith. Smith thought she meant the stool was broken, so he moved over a seat. “You can’t sit there, either.” She told him he could have a seat through the door on the right.

The door led outside.

With righteous indignation, Smith marched back into the diner and demanded to be served. After all, he was a soldier. He was protecting the waitress’s freedom, was he not? She threatened to call the manager. Smith helpfully suggested she call her mama.

The waitress called the manager. The manager called the police. The police escorted Smith to the train station, where they sat with him until the train departed at midnight.

An hour or two later, the conductor came through the “blacks only” car to punch the tickets. One of the passengers presented what looked like a ticket to the conductor. The passenger was upset, protesting about something. Smith couldn’t hear what was being said, but is certain the passenger was “protesting”.

Suddenly, the conductor pulled the emergency cord and the train stopped. It was so dark outside, you couldn’t see what was directly in front of you. 

The conductor snatched the passenger by his collar and dragged him to the door, where he literally *kicked* the man off the train. Because it was so dark, Smith couldn’t tell if they were on a steep embankment, a cliff, or a bridge. He knows it was something steep because he heard the man’s scream as he fell down, far away from train. 

The conductor greeted Smith and asked him for his ticket, as though nothing had happened. 

Smith said the Sheriff from Augusta told the conductor to, “*Find me a n….. This n….. here come in my restaurant, in my town, running off his mouth.  I can’t touch him because he’s military. I don’t want no problems. I don’t want nothing coming down to me. Get me a n…..!* And that’s what the conductor did. That n….. paid for me. He threw that n…. off the train because of me.”

Smith insisted the conductor knew exactly where the best spot was to throw someone off the train.

541,sbear1005,[],1637263396,"On November 18, 2021 Deputy Medical Examiner Kathryn Dougherty of the Waukesha County Medical Examiner’s Office and the DNA Doe Project (DDP) announced that investigative genetic genealogy was used to identify a 1977 car crash victim as John Lindberg Scott.

Photo compliments of the family
John Lindberg Scott, born May 6, 1950 was just 27 years old when he died in a single-vehicle car crash west of Delafield in 1977. At the time, he was being pursued by a Waukesha County Sheriff’s deputy for speeding. The car he was driving had been stolen from Gurnee, Illinois.

In October 2019 Deputy Medical Examiner Kathryn Dougherty brought the case of Delafield John Doe 1977 to the DDP. After a DNA sample was sequenced to produce a profile for upload to GEDmatch and FTDNA, the genealogists began their work in mid-2020 on what proved to be a difficult case. The DDP team was able to offer some initial direction, and then continued to update Dougherty with potential surnames to provide her with leads. Dougherty zeroed in on Mr. Scott earlier this year and eventually located a marriage record that provided her a specific candidate. DNA from John Scott’s sister, Jean Nunn, confirmed the correct identity.

“John’s case has touched so many lives over the decades, and it is such a blessing to be able to finally give him his name back and offer his family some answers as to where he’s been all these years,” said Dougherty. “Words cannot express how honored I am to restore his rightful name to him and work on returning him to his sister, where he belongs.”

The DNA Doe Project wishes to thank the many dedicated law enforcement professionals, scientists and volunteers who helped solve this case, including the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department and the Waukesha County Medical Examiner’s Office, and especially Deputy Medical Examiner Kathryn Dougherty. HudsonAlpha Discovery labs provided the whole genome sequencing and Kevin Lord of Saber Investigations performed the bioinformatics. We also extend our gratitude to GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA for providing their databases. Talented DDP volunteer genealogists made this identification possible.

**M**ichael ""Monkey"" Joseph Vaughan is a beautiful 5 year old boy who went missing in the small town  Fruitland, Idaho. Micheal went missing in his neighbourhood the evening of Tuesday, July 27, 2021. He was last seen around 6.30pm near his home on SW 9th Street, according to police.   

Michael was apparently home alone with his father, Tyler Vaughan and younger sister when he disappeared. According to the limited information he went to his next door neighbours house asking to play with their kids. The neighbour turned Michael down and watched him walk back towards his house, this was the last time anyone saw Michael.     
Michael's father was apparently changing a diaper and ordering pizza when Michael left the house unnoticed.   

Police has searched Michaels home at least 4 times and also bought in dogs, but Michaels scent could not be found. This could be due to many reasons, one being the amount of people to have entered the house during the time around and after his disappearance. The area where Michael and his family lives is surrounded by corn field and is quite rural. Corn fields however have been harvested and the canal locks of the snake river checked with no trace of Michael.    
The police have received 472 tips about his disappearance and are following up on each one, unfortunately to no luck. 

Law enforcement has used helicopters, drones and canines in the search of Michael and the National Centre for Missing  and Exploited Children has a team on location in Fruitland.  


Michael is described as approximately 3.7"" (109 cm) tall, weighing 50 pounds (22 kg) with blue eyes and blonde hair. At the time of his disappearance he was wearing a light blue Minecraft shirt, dark blue or black boxer briefs that had a green stripe, and flip flop sandals

In August of 2019, excavators discovered a pine box on a real estate development in Hudson, Summit County, Ohio. The box contained partially fossilized human remains. The remains were examined and determined to have belonged to a white male between the ages of 40 and 70. It was believed that he had been buried for 50 to 70 years, if not longer. Dr. Lisa Kohler, Summit County Medical Examiner, stated that while the area in which the remains were found was not a cemetery, there were reports of people being buried there in the 1800s. 

Richard was born in 1793 and is believed to have died around 1852. He likely lived on the property on which his remains were found. Richard is listed in the 1850 census, along with his wife Annie and several children, including a son named Anson. A 1856 map shows a plot labeled ""A. Bunce"" which may refer to Richard's wife Annie or his son Anson. The family land was sold to a neighbor in 1874.

544,milehighmystery,[],1637249815,"(Reposted with updated links) There was a discussion about lesser known missing Canadian people the other day, and I thought I’d add one bizarre case I recently found on an Instagram page.  (CanadaUnsolved) 

Susan Lynn Dawson was born on June 3, 1958, and was from Winnipeg, MB. During the early 1980s, she lived in various places throughout Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Little information is available about Susan’s life before her disappearance.  

In 1985, an insurance incident left 27-year-old Susan without a home, forcing her to move from Winnipeg to Saskatchewan. In October 1985, Susan and her blue heeler dog moved into a home owned by a man named Terry Murphy, in the small municipality of Neville, SK. 

The exact relationship between Susan Dawson and Terry Murphy is unclear; some agencies list Susan as Terry’s girlfriend, common-law wife, and even his live-in housekeeper. Terry was one of the few people Susan knew in Neville, and the two shared a love for animals, both assisting with the care of the town's livestock. It is unknown how long the two knew each other, or if they were in a romantic relationship when Susan moved into the home.

**The disappearance and explosion**

Three weeks after Susan moved in, Terry hosted a small house party. This was a regular occurrence in the small community of 200 and it was not uncommon for Terry’s home to be the party hotspot. On the evening of Tuesday, November 12, 1985, several of Terry’s friends joined him and Susan at the property in Neville, reveling late into the night. This was the last time anybody heard from Susan Dawson. 

Sometime on November 13, neighbors noticed an unfamiliar blue car parked in front of a yard across from an alley behind Terry’s home. Witnesses reported seeing the blue Buick parked throughout the day, but a specific timeframe was never disclosed. 

On Thursday, November 14 at approximately 11:55 a.m., the Ponteix RCMP detachment was dispatched after a massive explosion shook the small town. Police arrived at Terry Murphy’s residence in Neville, where the one-story home was destroyed by the explosion. While sifting through the rubble and debris, officers uncovered the remains of a decapitated man. The victim could not be immediately identified and the head appeared to be the only part of the body missing.  

On November 19, medical examiners in Regina used dental records to positively identify the victim as Terry Murphy. Experts also determined the explosion most likely came from the basement of the home. After Terry’s body was identified, the RCMP shifted the search towards Susan Dawson, who had not been heard from since the evening of the gathering on November 12. Unlike Terry, neither Susan nor her dog was located in the debris, leading investigators to suspect she had not been in the home during the explosion. 

The RCMP performed a ground search, with a helicopter surveying the area from the air. Because of the bitter cold weather and fresh snowfall, the search was called off after one day. Susan’s family conducted a search of their own in the spring of 1986, but no evidence was recovered from either search.  Susan’s car was later located in the parking lot of a store in Neville. Her purse was found in the backseat. 

On November 12, Terry had rented a 1985 Buick from a rental company thirty minutes away in Swift Current. The lease agreement showed that the car had been driven 300 kilometers/185 miles before it was abandoned behind Terry’s property. Investigators found a high caliber bullet hole in the trunk of the car, as well as a clip of rifle bullets left on the front seat. There were several shotgun shells scattered across the floorboard. 

The RCMP learned that Terry had recently been charged with 15 counts of various gun-related charges, and was due to appear in Provincial Court on December 3. Terry, an avid hunter, was also the suspect in an investigation conducted by Saskatchewan Conservation officers and was being charged with multiple wildlife infractions. According to his friends, Terry was very upset over the wildlife charges and spoke frequently about “rigging up a vehicle” with dynamite in retaliation. 

The RCMP contacted Susan’s family in Winnipeg and discovered she had not been seen or heard from since the gathering. Her family recalled her being in good spirits the last time she spoke with them on the phone on November 12, just before going to the party. It was unlike Susan to go for long periods without contacting her family or returning to Winnipeg. 

Much like her life, very little information is available about Susan’s disappearance, and her name usually appears alongside Terry Murphy.  The whereabouts of Susan and her blue heeler are unknown after the evening of November 12. Investigators suspect foul play and believe Terry was involved in her disappearance. 

Susan was 5’4 and weighed 110 lbs when she disappeared. She had brown eyes and hair. Dental records are also available. The RCMP Historical Case Unit still considers Susan Dawson a missing person and her case remains open.⁣⁣

545,Apache1One,[],1637249433,"On July 11, 1995, a fisherman traced a foul smell to a suitcase stuck in the mud near the Brandywine Creek, about an hour's drive west of Philadelphia. Inside was the head and torso of a white or Hispanic female aged 23-35, naked save for a blood-stained bra. Packed around her were a denim blouse and bloody bed sheets. 

Exacerbating the shock if this discovery was its location: just outside the  [Twin Tunnels](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/558292/pennsylvania-twin-tunnels-suitcase-jane-doe-murder-mystery). Old, creepy tunnels built under railroad tracks, the Twin Tunnels have long been the stuff of urban legends.  One says that a distraught young woman hanged herself in one of the tunnels while holding her baby—she died when the rope snapped her neck, and her infant plummeted to its death on the hard surface below. Some claim to have seen the mother's body swinging in the darkness, or heard her child's cries echoing throughout the underpass. Another piece of local folklore insists that a man shrouded in darkness.

A forensic investigation revealed the following about the woman the press named Suitcase Jane Doe: 

* the woman was white or Hispanic
* approximately 5'3
* no signs of sexual assault
* her legs were likely severed after death

Her fingerprints did not match those on file anywhere around the country and the summer heat had accelerated decomposition, making her facial features difficult to discern.

In January 1996, a jogger discovered trash bags discarded nearly 50 miles away from the Brandywine Creek. Inside the bags were a pair of severed legs. Medical examiners weren’t able to match the legs and torso with DNA evidence due to the decomposition, but the severed right leg bone fit perfectly into the hip of the torso. 

In 1997, renowned forensic sculptor Frank Bender--famous for creating the bust that led to the capture of [John List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_List)\--made a clay sculpture of the woman's face. This led to many tips being phoned into police, but they, as well as a feature on America's Most Wanted, failed to generate any solid leads. 

The woman's information has been added to databases such as CODIS, but this has also been a dead end as of this writing. I was not able to find and solid information regarding whether genetic genealogy is being used.

If you have any information regarding the identity of this woman or her killer, contact Trooper Chad Roberts of the Pennsylvania State Police at 717-299-7650.

546,milehighmystery,[],1637248288,"Susan Lynn Dawson was born on June 3, 1958, and was from Winnipeg, MB. During the early 1980s, she lived in various places throughout Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Little information is available about Susan’s life before her disappearance.  

In 1985, an insurance incident left 27-year-old Susan without a home, forcing her to move from Winnipeg to Saskatchewan. In October 1985, Susan and her blue heeler dog moved into a home owned by a man named Terry Murphy, in the small municipality of Neville, SK. 

The exact relationship between Susan Dawson and Terry Murphy is unclear; some agencies list Susan as Terry’s girlfriend, common-law wife, and even his live-in housekeeper. Terry was one of the few people Susan knew in Neville, and the two shared a love for animals, both assisting with the care of the town's livestock. It is unknown how long the two knew each other, or if they were in a romantic relationship when Susan moved into the home.

**The disappearance and explosion**

Three weeks after Susan moved in, Terry hosted a small house party. This was a regular occurrence in the small community of 200 and it was not uncommon for Terry’s home to be the party hotspot. On the evening of Tuesday, November 12, 1985, several of Terry’s friends joined him and Susan at the property in Neville, reveling late into the night. This was the last time anybody heard from Susan Dawson. 

Sometime on November 13, neighbors noticed an unfamiliar blue car parked in front of a yard across from an alley behind Terry’s home. Witnesses reported seeing the blue Buick parked throughout the day, but a specific timeframe was never disclosed. 

On Thursday, November 14 at approximately 11:55 a.m., the Ponteix RCMP detachment was dispatched after a massive explosion shook the small town. Police arrived at Terry Murphy’s residence in Neville, where the one-story home was destroyed by the explosion. While sifting through the rubble and debris, officers uncovered the remains of a decapitated man. The victim could not be immediately identified and the head appeared to be the only part of the body missing.  

On November 19, medical examiners in Regina used dental records to positively identify the victim as Terry Murphy. Experts also determined the explosion most likely came from the basement of the home. After Terry’s body was identified, the RCMP shifted the search towards Susan Dawson, who had not been heard from since the evening of the gathering on November 12. Unlike Terry, neither Susan nor her dog was located in the debris, leading investigators to suspect she had not been in the home during the explosion.

I'm sure you all are familiar with mysteries like Panchiko or the (still on-going) most mysterious song on the internet. If you like things similar to those, this lost media mystery could interest you as well.

This search has been going on just between less than 5 friends, and since progress is going slower than ever, we decided to try making the search bigger. If you live in Germany, Switzerland or Austria, the chances that you've heard of the band **Madsen** are quite big.

They're a very popular band amongst German speaking countries with almost 500'000 monthly listeners on Spotify, having delivered excellent indie- and punk rock over the years. Madsen's debut album released in 2005. What most people don't know, is that they already released an album nearly 10 years earlier, when they were just 13-16 years old. Madsen had a total of 4 bands before they formed their current band, and about half of what they released is lost to time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bands**

*Click on the band names to hear previews of their songs:*

[Hoerstuatz](https://voca.ro/1bnd7aZ0dYQf), the direct predecessor of Madsen and our focus of this search. Unlike Madsen's style of indie-rock, this was a Crossover/Nu Metal/Rapcore band. They released 1 EP and self-released an album.

[Alices Gun](https://voca.ro/1hZUpx8H4PzX), Hoerstuatz's grunge-y side project with English lyrics. They released 3 albums, however, we could only find **2 snippets** of the first album ""[Iron Butterfly](https://voca.ro/1jg7DgWm4cfm)"".

**Fucking Punk Looser**, another side project with both songs in English and German. All songs are currently lost, but from what we can gather, this was a melodic punk rock band. Some of their songs were available at MySpace at one point, so it is to assume that they sold demo CDs at gigs.

**Haverhead** \- there is absolutely no information about this side project available, other than it existed and they played concerts.

&amp;#x200B;

**What We're Trying to Find**

The lost media of those bands are enormous. Going back to Hoerstuatz's old website using the wayback machine, we discovered that their songlist includes more songs than we are currently in possession of. One of these songs has been uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkzvLxTYJ48).

Our question is, where does that song originate from? Were there more than 2 albums? We've managed to contact some of their old band members, but to no avail. They either don't own any material anymore or don't want to talk about it.

We have tried to get more info through a documentary film, which we were able to buy a personal copy of from the director herself(!). The documentary included snippets of what seem to be songs called ""Hardcorepitysong"", ""Wo Bist Du?"" and an unknown one. Both of these have been scrobbled on last.fm, including various other unreleased songs, so the possibility of someone still being in possession of them is big.

Alices Gun's first album Iron Butterfly is completely missing. Besides that, they were working on a 4th album in 2004, and released the material they had of it on MySpace. Sadly, it's been lost because of MySpace's major fuck-up. But the songs, again, have been scrobbled on last.fm. Fucking Punk Looser songs have also been uploaded to MySpace, but they are yet again lost.

One person scrobbled the Haverhead \[[https://www.last.fm/music/Haverhead](https://www.last.fm/music/Haverhead)\] song ""Hate Me"", but it's uncertain if it's **the** Haverhead we're searching for.

The deputy caught up to the vehicle to pull it over. The driver exited onto Golf Road and attempted to evade the deputy at a high rate of speed. The driver approached the intersection of Golf Road and County Road SS (potentially Prospect Avenue today.)

The driver lost control of his vehicle here and rolled into a wooded area near this intersection. No other vehicles were involved in this incident and the driver appeared to be the only person in the car. The deputy found the vehicle upside down, and found the deceased driver twenty-five feet away.  Further investigation found that John Doe's vehicle had been stolen from Gurnee, Illinois, roughly 67 miles southeast of the accident site. 

Interesting items found in the vehicle included a Waltham wrist watch, 3 sets of keys, several bags of women's clothes, cash inside a wallet, an envelope with the name Scott written on it containing unidentified pills, and a cigarette lighter with the inscription ""To John, love Lauri.""

However when the policemen looked into the story it transpired none of the neighbours had seen the child for perhaps more than a year and it is very likely an imposter had been taken by the mother/carer to a routine doctor's appointment. There was also some kind of clerical crossed wires where two different and overlapping school catchment-areas thought the other had enrolled the child and therefore no suspicions were raised there either.

Investigators say they know the identity of the “Tiger Lady” unsolved homicide victim whose remains were founded 30 years ago in Warren County.

“Through ongoing collaboration and investigation, ‘Tiger Lady’ has been identified as a missing teen from Coatesville, Pennsylvania,” Warren County Prosecutor James Pfeiffer said in a news release Wednesday.

He and the New Jersey State Police Cold Case Unit are planning a major announcement in the investigation on Friday morning in Belvidere, according to the release.

The young female victim’s remains were reported to state police on Oct. 26, 1991, near mile-post 0.6 of Interstate 80 in Knowlton Township.

Unidentified all these years, the victim became known as the “Tiger Lady” for a large Bengal tiger tattoo on her left calf.

While her death was ruled a homicide, investigators were never able to determine how she died. It is believed she was dumped off the highway near the Pennsylvania border. Coatesville is in Chester County, about 30 miles west of Philadelphia.

Pfeiffer said he’ll also be joined at Friday’s news conference, set for 11 a.m. at the Goodwill Fire Co., by the state police Office of Forensic Sciences, Center for Human Identification, BODE Technologies and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Pfeiffer, upon taking office last year, made it a priority to use DNA technology to solve the cold-case homicide of the “Tiger Lady” as well as that of “Princess Doe,” who was found beaten to death on July 15, 1982, in Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown. “Princess Doe” remains unidentified.

Investigators earlier this year announced advances in DNA evidentiary science led to the identification of the dismembered body of “Beth Doe,” found in December 1976 along I-80 in Carbon County, as the remains of 15-year-old Evelyn Colon, of Jersey City.

551,bengoshijane,[],1637198422,"SUMMARY OF FACTS

At 4:00 a.m. on May 19, 2015, Monique Figueroa, 28 at the time, was last seen driving away from her home in Littlerock, California. Ms. Figueroa had a two (2) year old daughter, who was left in the care of family members. 

Littlerock is a desert community in the Antelope Valley part of northern Los Angeles County where there is a significant element of crime and drugs present in the area. For reference, it is right near Lancaster and Palmdale. When Ms. Figueroa disappeared, she was driving her burgundy 2003 Mercedes-Benz SUV which was found eleven (11) days later in an abandoned shed in Juniper Hills, which is about 7 miles from her home and in a sparsely populated area.

At the time of her disappearance, Ms. Figueroa was reportedly using and dealing drugs--particularly methamphetamine (“meth”), although her father had recently convinced her to check into rehab and get clean. Ms. Figueroa’s boyfriend at the time, David Nash McKell, who was 35 at the time of the disappearance, had recently been arrested on a murder charge.  Ms. Figueroa was reportedly looking for a fresh start for the sake of her daughter. Her father had lined up a treatment facility. Ms. Figueroa, who had always been a superior student, wanted to get clean, move to a new place and enroll in school. But Ms. Figueroa told her father that before she could check into the treatment center, there was one last thing that she was going to do.  Her father suspected trouble and tried to talk her out of her plans, whatever they were, telling her that her boyfriend’s friends were not good for her. However, she insisted, but planned a particular date to report to rehab.

As noted, Ms. Figueroa’s boyfriend at the time was David McKell. At the time of her disappearance, Mr. McKell was in custody on multiple murder charges. Mr. McKell’s picture is available online and he is pretty frightening looking. He has face tattoos and the large letters “AGK,” which is apparently the initials of his gang “Always Going Krazy,” tattooed across his neck. 

After linking up with Mr. McKell, Monique Figueroa started using meth. To support the habit, she also began dealing meth.  According to an unnamed source in the Daily Beast article by M.L. Nestle, an off-the-record source indicated that Ms. Figueroa had been getting meth fronted to her from a gang of white supremacists. She was then selling the meth to customers for a profit, including to AGK members. AGK eventually was able to find meth at a cheaper price.  Ms. Figueroa then began selling the AGK meth to the white supremacists. It should be noted that both Ms. Figueroa and Mr. McKell are bi-racial, each being half Mexican and half white. Apparently, the situation was tense and Ms. Figueroa received anonymous threats during this time.

Mr. McKell had been arrested on March 11, 2015, for the murder of 18 year old Troy Filinow, who had been killed in Palmdale on February 2, 2015 (approximately four (4) months before Ms. Figueroa’s disappearance) when he crossed paths with Mr. McKell. For reasons that are unclear, Mr. McKell and Mr. Filinow ended up in physical altercation in the street. As Mr. Filinow started getting the upperhand in the fight, Mr. McKell took out a gun and shot him twice, killing him right there. \[Mr. McKell was later convicted of two murders and an attempted murder for this crime.\]

Mr. McKell had been on the lam since the February 2nd shooting and was reportedly staying in a tent in a relative’s yard. When he was arrested, Ms. Figueroa was with him. She got picked up to an a meth distribution charge. Ms. Figueroa refused to cooperate with authorities and she was bailed out of jail by her family. It may have appeared to AGK gang members that Ms. Figueroa had cooperated with police in order to be released, although law enforcement claims she was not actually willing to help them.

While Mr. McKell was in custody for the murder of Troy Filinow, the investigation led law enforcement to connect his to another crime. Specifically, on February 8, 2015 (a mere week after the Filinow murder) Mr. McKell and two of his compadres from AGK committed two murders and attempted another when robbing three men of meth and $40K cash. \[Mr. McKell was later convicted of this crime as well.\]

Meanwhile, Ms. Figueroa was on the outside. She was becoming more and more fearful that the white supremacists may target her for her involvement in the meth-dealing situation. She was afraid the escalating situation. Three (3) days before she disappeared, she reportedly asked Mr. McKell for help in a phone call. He told her to seek protection from other AGK members. It is important to note that, at this time, at least two AGK members were involved in the robbery/homicide that was being linked to Mr. McKell. These individuals may have been fearful that Ms. Figueroa was cooperating, or would cooperate, with the police. Nonetheless, Ms. Figueroa seemed to have confidence that AGK would protect her from the white supremacists.

When Ms. Figueroa left her home on May 19, 2015 for the last time, she was intending to do one last drug deal to make a substantial amount of money. She was hoping to then check into rehab and, upon her completion of the program, use the money to relocate with her daughter. Ms. Figueroa reportedly stating that she was going to meet “friends” in Los Angeles. She made a phone call to her connect and indicated she was about twenty (20) minutes away. It is unknown if she made it meeting or if she ever made it out of Littlerock. She never returned. 

Each of Ms. Figueroa’s parents did receive a text message from her that stated: “Had to leave, be home soon.” However, the parents suspect the text messages were not from Ms. Figueroa and the timing of these messages are unclear. The parents report that it was out of character for Ms. Figueroa not to come home, especially if her daughter was in the care of family. Also, she missed the agreed upon date for rehab. On May 23, 2015, her father reported her missing. Then, eleven (11) days after her disappearance, her car was found. It was hidden in a shed about seven (7) miles from her home. The side of the car was all scratched up, like someone had tried to run it off the road. 

According to authorities, Ms. Figueroa is no longer a missing person, but a “no-body homicide.”

In 2016, a tip came in that Ms. Figueroa may be buried on a particular stretch of the Pear Blossom Highway. Authorities brought dig equipment and cadaver dogs to the location, but nothing was found. In fact, authorities indicated that they had inspected at least six potential sites where they though Ms. Figueroa’s remains might be located, but they have not found her body.  

In November of 2020, L.A. County Sheriff’s Department Detective Karen Shonka told a reporter from The Daily Beast, “I know what happened and I’m working to recover her body and put my evidence together” and noting that “it’s going to be very, very hard.”

Who killed Monique Figueroa?

Suspects include the white supremacists gang, the AGK gang, the ex-boyfriend pulling the strings from behind bars, or the connect for the last drug deal.

The Bedford, TX Police Department claims that the assailant was her neighbor, Ray Anthony Chapa. They say he broke into Love’s home, sexually assaulted her and then shot her to death. For years, he lived in an apartment building not 1,000 feet away from Love’s.

Love moved to Bedford in 1985 from Louisiana to work for Delta Airlines at the nearby DFW airport. Her body was found on April 24, 1986.

“We looked at a lot of serial offenders over the years, trying to match somebody up to this,”said Sergeant Brett Bowen of the Bedford Police. 
Chief Jeff Williams said: “[Bedford PD] is 100 percent sure this is the person who committed this terrible crime. Chapa had no known ties to the victim and was never considered a suspect until DNA technology revealed the truth.”

Police used DNA, CODIS, and a forensic genealogist (the article does not say which one) to make the identification.

Chapa died in January 2021.

In the film, Joseph Burgoon, a former detective who worked on the case until his retirement, said the strangers were rummaging for scraps after their car broke down. One of the men flickered their lighter and saw her body laying in a corner of the basement.

Burgoon said the unnamed men ran outside and immediately called police to report the incident. 

He also said he and other officers initially thought she was an adult prostitute or a drug addict because she was laying face down nude, but when they turned her over, they realized she was a child. 

Eric McAlister, who lived two blocks over from the crime scene, said at the screening he wanted to give his perspective as a ten-year-old boy.

He said he was at the crime scene and witnessed commotion from adults who were concerned about the tragedy. 

“My friends and I came from the park, and all the kids gathered around to see over the crowd,” he said. “We climbed this tree that was about 12 feet high for a visual over top of the crowd to see what was going on, and we heard it was a deceased body. We didn’t know the details. Then, as minutes went by with talk from the crowd, it was revealed it was a child.”

The question was asked if the situation had a major effect on his childhood at the screening, and he said it not only affected him, but it impacted the community.

He said families weren’t allowed to visit and spend the night at each other’s house anymore. He added schools were stricter about attendance by doing headcounts every day and accounting for every child in their classroom.

Burgoon said he and other officers contacted schools in town about missing children, but they ran into some challenges. It was later determined kids were unable to be tracked after transferring schools due to schools terminating secretaries because of a budget crisis. Police notified families, but they never received word back from any parents.

The search continued, and the FBI, NCIC, NAMUS, VICAP, the Missing Persons Unit, and other organizations were contacted with the hope of potentially receiving leads and more information about who the girl is. The case even received national attention. Burgoon appeared on an episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” with other detectives around the country to discuss the case.

Burgoon said Captain Leroy Adkins, the first African American to head the city’s homicide division, delayed Hope’s burial for nine months, assuming her family could come forward with information, but it never happened. She was finally laid to rest Dec. 2, 1983, at Washington Park Cemetery.

In May 1984, a group of high schoolers from Livingston, Illinois, raised money to buy a headstone for her grave.

In 2009, detectives went to the cemetery to find her grave to start the exhumation process, but instead, they left in a disarray. Three bodies were crowded together, and none of them were hers. Her headstone was also placed on the wrong grave.

The medical examiner’s office declined to authorize another dig unless the exact location of her grave could be verified. Researchers were eventually able to locate her body, thanks to a photo captured by a Belleville photographer.

A second digging took place in 2013, and she was found. Detectives were able to find her grave and determine it was her based on the decapitation at her shoulder level.

Freddie Jefferson, an exhumation volunteer and veteran, helped find her the second time.

“We were hoping \[the\] water didn’t sink in because it stormed that day,” he said. “We worked very hard to get the casket open. We finally got it open, took her body bag out, and hauled it out.”

She was taken to the morgue where samples were extracted and sent to the Smithsonian Institution. Mineral tests determined she wasn’t originally from St. Louis. 

Burgoon said the medical examiner’s office, the morgue, and a forensic anthropologist determined she was between the ages of 8-11, 61 pounds, the height of 4’10” without her head, and between 5’3”-5’4” if the head were still intact.

A one-hour reburial was held Feb. 8, 2014, at Calvary Cemetery’s “Garden of Innocents,” an area designated for unidentified individuals.

The St. Louis Police Department dedicated a room to “St. Louis Baby Jane Doe” and are still actively working on the case.

“We’d like to find out who she is, who did that to her and get with the family to let them know we never forgot her,” Burgoon said. “We did the best we could.” 

Sosa said his motivation for making the film comes from remembering his late mother telling him as a kid to come inside because little kids’ heads were being cut off.

“When you’re seven, eight years old, you don’t know what she’s talking about, but it always stayed with me,” he said. “My mom and I talked a lot about this case, so I dedicated the film to her.”

Lee Barber, assistant director of the film, said what sets their documentary apart from information that’s already out there are interviews from Burgoon, McAlister, and Jefferson and having the coroner’s report.

“That's the reason why we wanna get it out there because the new information that we are able to bring to the public will hopefully generate new information on finding who she is ‘cause that’s the main thing,’” he said. “That’s the biggest reason why we did the documentary, so she can be laid to rest under her own name and not as a Jane Doe or a Precious Hope. She’s very precious, but we want her to be buried under her own name.”

555,York_Street1,[],1637150156,"A few days ago, I was listening to Steely Dan's *Pretzel Logic* album (as you do) and began to wonder whether or not the [picture](http://www.popspotsnyc.com/pretzel_logic/Pretzel_logic.jpg) on the front of the album cover was staged or not.

And... it turns out it's not!

The woman who photographed this ""Pretzle Man,"" Raeanne Rubenstein, apparently found this man in central park on a winter day, took his picture, and Steely Dan slapped his face onto their album cover. So this guy is real! Not just a lame actor.

Now this begs the question: who is this guy? Obviously, he's not alive because he looks over 50 in the photo and this photo is almost 50 years old... and if you're selling pretzels on the street you're probably not in the *best* financial situation to pay hospital bills. But, I don't know, this guy could have kids, grandkids, or cousins still alive who possibly knew him.

So I did a little research and found... nothing.

From far as I can tell, nobody knows who this guy is. The closest I've got to finding an answer was a comment I found on Walter Becker Media that says, ""According to **Brian Sweet's Steely Dan book**, the vendor on the cover of Pretzel Logic was approached to sign a release form for the use of the photograph and he refused. Some digging was done on the vendor to find he had no license so it was unlikely he would sue, so the photograph was used.""

Now the book that this comment is talking about is real ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Steely-Dan-Reelin-Brian-Sweet/dp/1468313142)), but the claim that the commentor makes is questionable because the OP says he actually *has* this book, has read it multiple times, and has never found this piece of information before. And if this ""Pretzle Man"" does not have a permit like this comment says it's going to make it very, very-- almost impossible to figure out who this guy is.

I don't have this book that the commentor is talking about, ***Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years*** **by Brian Sweet**, but if *you* have it **please** let me know.

If you have any other information about the ""Pretzle Man,"" please comment down below.

I wonder if the pretzel stand still exists...","Who is the ""Pretzle Man"" featured on Steely Dan's Pretzel Logic album cover?"

[Ronald and Doreen Jack](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/missing-jack-family-age-progressed-photos-1.5702888) were a couple living in Prince George, BC with their boys Russel, 9, and Ryan, 4. On **August 1 of 1989**, Ronald met a man at the [First Litre Pub](https://ibb.co/KFZKPcW) who offered him and his wife a job at a logging camp in the Cluculz Lake area. Ronald was told he would be bucking logs while Doreen would assist the cook as a helper. Ronald was also informed that the camp offered a daycare facility for his kids.

On **August 2 of 1989**, Ronald reached out to his family to let them know that he, Doreen and the boys would be out of town for 10 days for this new position. That same morning, they left their home at around 1:30 am. A [cousin of the Jacks](https://ibb.co/F77PQYV) who dropped by the Jack house as the family was packing  reported seeing a white 35-40 year-old man who stood between 6'0 and 6'5 and weighted between 200 and 275 pounds. This man would give the Jacks a lift in his vehicle and he was believed to be the person who extended the job offer to the family. 

When the Jacks failed to re-establish contact with their loved ones after 10 days, the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) issued a tourist alert](https://ibb.co/nnsk5sp) on *Nanaimo Daily News* on **August 29** urging the Jacks to reach out to their family who was living in Burns Lake.

On **September 13**, *Lake District News* reported that the [Jacks had contacted Ronald's family](https://ibb.co/VmQgY96) and the RCMP to let them know that they were okay. However, a [another report](https://ibb.co/dgQg53c) suggested that nobody heard from the Jacks after the early morning of August 02. Therefore, it is unclear if the report by *Lake District News* was a mistake or if somebody else had called.

On **January 28 of 1996** a man told the RCMP that the Jack family was dead and buried in the South end of Gordy's (Cordy's or Corry's) ranch. The call was traced back to Stoney Creek in the Vanderhoof area, but the caller has not been identified.

Authorities conducted an excavation on **August 28-30 of 2019** South of Vanderhoof, but uncovered no evidence relating to the Jacks. To this day, the whereabouts of the family remains a mystery.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE THEORIES**

**Foul play**

The RCMP believes that foul play is the most likely explanation for the disappearance of the Jack family. Ronald had been offered a job on the spot by a stranger and nobody came out to corroborate the employment of the couple at any of the logging camps. RCMP also noticed how the availability of a daycare at a camp was unusual. In this scenario, the job offer might have been a lie from a predator to lure the Jacks towards their deaths, or a genuine working position where the family got killed to cover up some existing issue.

It must be noted that the cousin who described the man who drove the Jacks out of Prince George only saw him as he was waiting for the family. For this reason, the RCMP is not sure if the man was the one to offer them the job or if he was involved with the case beyond giving the family a ride

**Accident**

The RCMP considers an accident a possibility, but has expressed that if that was the case, there would be evidence of a wreckage and the mystery man traveling with the family would have been reported missing. This does not have to be the case, in my opinion. Authorities did not know where exactly the family was heading. If the family took one of the logging roads besides a body of water, which were are common in that area, the vehicle could have sled into one of these hiding it along with the family. If the man the Jacks were traveling with did not keep a close contact with his family, then he might have been reported missing in another town or province if at all.

**Murder-suicide**

Ronald had been out of work due to a back injury and the Jacks were living on government aid, which is very little money to go by. Furthermore, [he might have been physically abusive towards Doreen](https://ibb.co/3fNtjhV). These might have been stressors that led to an unfortunate situation once the family arrived at the camp.

**If the position offered to the Jacks was genuine, but plagued by legal irregularities, this might explain why the employer(s) never came out to corroborate Ronald's story about his job offer in any of the above scenarios.**",A family of four vanishes after parents are offered a job by a stranger.

Either way, it might give some hope for those who are still searching for missing loved ones, or seeking justice for the deceased many years later. 

A woman assaulted a 2 year old child, which resulted in the toddlers death. The incident occurred in 1987 at a rural property in NSW, Australia. A man assisted the woman in disposing of the child’s remains. 

The woman, who has since relocated to New Zealand, along with the man have been arrested. 

Another article mentioned a father was left without his daughter but didn’t mention the child’s mother, which makes me wonder if the woman involved was the child’s biological mother.

561,ForgetfulLucy28,[],1637093682,"A car has been seized from a property in Sydney as part of fresh investigations into the disappearance of William Tyrrell seven years ago.

The car, which belonged to the now-dead foster-grandmother of Tyrrell, was seized last Tuesday from Gymea in southern Sydney and taken to a secure facility.

It is expected to undergo forensic examination and analysis for several weeks.

The seizure is significant given police have not had any major breakthroughs in the case since William vanished in 2014.

It comes as investigators begin their third day of new searches where Tyrrell was last seen — in the garden of his foster grandmother's house in Kendall, on the Mid-North Coast.

The searches were prompted by fresh information recently obtained by police.

Forensic teams have spent the night spraying the chemical luminol outside the Kendall home as they search for traces of blood.

Neighbours yesterday watched as officers leading a cadaver dog returned to the house on Benaroon Drive and began digging up the garden beneath the home's second-storey balcony.

NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller had earlier revealed investigations were focused on a new person of interest, although who that was remains unclear.

**Helene Leyden**. [Woman from the Mikisew Cree First Nation](https://int-missing.fandom.com/wiki/Helene_Leyden) living in Edmonton, AB when she separated from her husband.

Sequin's father kept her and her sibling(s) away from Helene's family. Nobody remembers having any contact with Helene since 1971, although some sources report 1968 as the earliest year anybody heard from her. Sequin says Helene might have gone to Vancouver with a man. Helene had a boy with another man before she met Sequin's father and Sequin was eventually contacted by another woman who said she was also Helene's daughter but was put up for adoption. It's not clear if this woman was born after Helene lost contact with her family.

**Lois Perret**. 21 or 22 year old woman last seen at her job by her boyfriend at her workplace in Toronto, ON on January 30 of 1970. She was three-month pregnant at the time and decided to quit her job and move out of her apartment. It is not clear where she was moving or if she had found a different job.

Witnesses report that Edie could have left Cedar Point by crossing the lake over the ice. If this was the case, Edie must have fallen through thin ice and died of hypothermia or drowning.

She was caught on CCTV entering Seamus O’Donnell’s Irish pub in the city centre at around 21.30, and staff said she left around 23.15, though it wasn’t on CCTV.  She may have walked towards the river that runs through the city, but despite extensive CCTV searches, no record was found. 

Claire was 5’, slim, and had brown hair. She was wearing black trousers, and a black short-sleeved tee with a grey tee underneath, and carrying a large reusable Primark bag. Claire was a prolific Facebook user but hasn’t logged in, or used her phone or bank cards, since June 6th. She’s the mother of a small child, and was reported missing by her family on June 14th, after missing appointments to see her child. Little is known about her lifestyle. 

A 37 year old man was arrested on suspicion of murder, but later released. He is still under investigation. 

What happened to Claire on that warm summer’s night? Will specialist divers and police officers messaging her Facebook friends finally uncover the truth?

[Kendrick Johnson ](https://uncovered.com/cases/kendrick-johnson/timeline)was a 17 year old student at Lowndes High School. Also known as KJ, he was an accomplished student athlete who was close with his family. He played basketball, football and ran track. According to the Facebook page created by his family, KJ can be described as having a bright smile and a humble spirit. 

**Last time Kendrick is seen**. Kendrick was [last seen on January 10th, 2013 at 1:27pm](https://uncovered.com/cases/kendrick-johnson/timeline) entering the old gym at his high school. At this time, Lowndes High School had two gyms, an ‘old’ gym and a ‘new’ gym; the old gym became the main storage facility for the oversized wrestling mats. According to surveillance footage, a student entered the old gym before Kendrick did, but was confirmed that they were going to class. Kendrick is seen walking on the right side of the gym where the mats are located which is out of frame in the video. 

In the surveillance footage, no one is seen following Kendrick. Around this same time, the Lowndes High School wrestling team was en route with a busload of 25 wrestlers heading to Macon, Georgia for a tournament. By 12:30AM on January 11th, 2013; Jackie Johnson reports her son, Kendrick missing after he didn’t return home from school that evening. 

**The next day.** On January 11th, 2013 Kendricks body was discovered wrapped in a large wrestling mat in the old gym of Lowndes High School. A student noticed a set of socks sticking out of the mat and upon looking closer a student recognized Kendrick in one of the rolled standing mats. Officers were immediately called to the scene and the school was quickly put on lockdown. [Almost a week later, his family and friends held a vigil in his honor.](https://www.justiceforkendrickjohnson17.org/) 

**The first autopsy.** On May 2nd, 2013, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation determined Kendricks death was ruled as an accident. The cause of death was positional asphyxia as a result of falling into the standing rolled-up mat and getting stuck while reaching for a shoe at the bottom of the mat. However, his family believes KJ was murdered as a result of information in the paramedics report. 

**The second autopsy.** On June 6th, 2013, [a judge granted the Johnson family permission to exhume their son for a second autopsy.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdga/pr/united-states-attorney-remarks-regarding-kendrick-johnson-investigation) A forensic pathologist in Orlando, Florida is hired by the family to perform the autopsy. A month later, the family filed a wrongful death suit against the Lowndes County Board of Education nearly a year after Kendrick’s death citing that the school board did not properly investigate an incident between Kendrick’s and another classmate. On September 3rd, 2013, the results of Kendrick’s second autopsy were revealed. The independent pathologist stated that Kendrick’s cause of death was “unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma”. 

**The Third Autopsy:** Five years later,the Johnson family once again filed for Kendrick’s body to be exhumed and scheduled a third autopsy. On November 15th, 2018, the results determined that the cause of death was non accidental, blunt force trauma to his right neck and right thorax.

Hoping that this is ok, I would like to have a post dedicated purely to just seeing what your theory on this case is. 

Summary: William Tyrrell went missing from his foster grandmothers yard back in 2014. After 7 years, in the past few days it has come to light that there is a new suspect, the foster mother has been called to court for an AVO, and the foster sister has been removed from their care.

566,Sandi_T,[],1637039149,"If you are unfamiliar with my mother's case, I did a write-up here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MarieAnnWatson/comments/lwfm9n/an\_attempt\_to\_put\_this\_case\_into\_a\_manageable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarieAnnWatson/comments/lwfm9n/an_attempt_to_put_this_case_into_a_manageable/) 

Please read it before proceeding, and look through her subreddit if you wish. Many people ask me a lot of questions when new to the case; I've tried to be thorough and answer them there. You will find newspaper clippings and news footage, as well as podcasts there. r/MarieAnnWatson

Once you have familiarized yourself with the case, hopefully this will make more sense to you. 

The same officer investigated in 1996 and again began investigating in 2016. When he retired, this was the explanation he gave me for what they had pieced together happened to Marie.

Marie Ann Watson is my mother, and she is the victim in the case. I have long said that Mike and Dorothy Rogers (my foster ~~monsters~~ parents at the time, who were in a custody battle with her) killed her. I've stated for my entire life that I saw them dismembering her. Raymond is the eldest foster brother. He was 17 at the time. 

The case is quite convoluted and there are a LOT of very suspicious things that went on; particularly with local law enforcement. Please, please do read the link if unfamiliar with her case. Even if you do know the case, it might be worth a refresher. 

........

If you've followed or read about the case, you likely know that Dorothy Rogers claimed she and Marie drove to Oregon from Idaho to get records about me. They were about sexual abuse that was happening to me. The court had ordered that I see a child psychiatrist trained to find out if children were being sexually abused. 

What Dorothy said (quite a long while after Marie disappeared) happened on the way back was that their car slid off the road into a snowbank. Investigation showed there was no snow that day, it was unseasonably warm and would have melted any, and there had been no recent heavy snows (so no leftover from earlier snows). This was not investigated at the time. Dorothy went on to say that, while they were stuck in the snowbank, a black car pulled up, Marie got out to argue with the driver of it, and then hopped in and was never seen again. 

What they now believe happened instead was that Raymond was with them. He was in the back seat of the car, and when Dorothy and Marie began to argue, he reached forward and sliced Marie's throat the way he had been taught to kill cattle. 

(A note on this: In 1996, I gave a deposition that I had seen a blue car with black and white seats. There was blood on the black and white seats. In this investigation, they learned that Raymond's car was a blue [Ford Galaxie](https://fordauthority.com/2020/01/this-1964-ford-galaxie-500-xl-is-a-peacock-blue-beauty/). He had cow-hide seat covers. They found three witnesses who said they had seen Raymond's car with everything torn out of the interior. He claimed he was restoring it.)

They brought the body home, where I remember seeing her with ""her head dangling weirdly"" as Mike carried her into the house and upstairs. I saw her body stuffed into the ""hidden gun cabinet"" compartment behind the food shelves in the upstairs storage pantry. I then saw them dismembering her. (They were not aware of this, I was hiding) They were throwing scraps to the pigs they owned (this was not uncommon when they were butchering).

Taken from very detailed threats Mike made to fellow workers at the local sawmill where he worked, they pieced together that Mike had sawed her up (as I saw happening). He then put her body into burlap bags and took her remains across the road to a hog farm on the other side of the road, using the slough to reach it stealthily (a canoe). He tossed the bags into the pens to be consumed by the many hogs there.

I have put an image of the property (a recent image, circa 2019, as I recall) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarieAnnWatson/comments/quzolp/5611_cascade_road_the_red_box_is_around_the/). If you look at the image there, you'll see just below and left of it, the property visible there is, and was then, a decent sized hog farming operation. 

After having interviewed numerous people, Tom came to the conclusion that this hog farm was the best bet in finding parts of Marie. He called the FBI and they came and excavated at the hog farm, with the farmer's permission. 

They found very, very small bone fragments, and tested the DNA. The DNA came back as white, female, approximately 25-28 years old. Marie was 27 when she ""disappeared"". Unfortunately, the bone fragment was completely consumed and they weren't able to get enough DNA to do a comparison analysis to see if the bones were related to myself and my half brother.

Just before he left, he said that Ada County had agreed that, if they could find three witnesses who saw Raymond's car interior stripped, they would prosecute. The case was originally in Gem county because that's where the disposal happened, but if it happened in the car at the location stated by Dorothy as the last place she saw Marie alive, it would move jurisdiction to Ada County. 

However; even after being given the requested witnesses, they declined to pursue the matter. 

Another note here is that Michelle (one of the foster kids, who remained with Dorothy and was the only one known to have been legally adopted by her) drew the same map of the property that I did. I had stated that Michelle and Kathleen had prevented me from looking out the window when I said I heard something outside. I haven't seen or spoken to Michelle since 1979; the same for the other foster kids. 

Michelle tried to claim that she was with me the entire time, but she wasn't. However, she did draw the precise map of both the house and the property and where the dismemberment was taking place. However, she recanted her story and turned hostile the next day. 

I no longer see any reason to keep this secret. There's no court case to ""ruin"" because they are never going to do squat about it. Mike died and then recently Dorothy died. So now you know what Tom told me happened...

They DID get DNA, they DID get their witnesses, they DID get human bone fragments from the exact place that they expected to... but still... not going to be arsed to follow up on it. 

Over forty years of trying to get someone to listen and do something, but here we are.","Marie Ann Watson Case: Dorothy Rogers (suspect) has died.

567,Mr_Write_NEO,[],1637020646,"Aria left her young daughter, Maleigha, with her mother before being dropped off at work at the Harem, about half an hour’s drive northeast of her rural western Ohio hometown. Her last contact with family was a phone call to her mother later that night.

Aria had worked at a few different gentleman’s clubs in the Dayton area in the months leading up to her death, and she’d amassed a handful of regular clients, mostly lonely middle-aged men who weren’t above trading the occasional gift or fancy dinner for a few hours of companionship with a friendly, bubbly young girl. At least one of these regular customers dropped off the radar completely following Aria’s disappearance, only returning to the club where Aria worked months later — at which point he promptly began fixating on another dancer who physically resembled Aria.

Other persons of interest include friends who visited Aria at work: one, a female acquaintance with whom she often shared “boy drama,” was later rumored to be in possession of some of the missing girl’s property; another, a male friend, is shockingly rumored to have “bragged” to mutual acquaintances about being present the night Aria died. When approached by family members with this information, however, local police declined to investigate, calling the reports hearsay.

Managers at The Harem were equally unhelpful, refusing to provide security camera footage from the night Aria disappeared until long after the fact. The Harem would later be ordered closed following a raid in 2017 which resulted in nearly a dozen employees and patrons being charged with drug and prostitution-related offenses.

Aria’s body was found lying next to a fallen tree and partially covered by foliage in a wooded area inside Art Van Atta Park, less than two miles from The Harem, two months after her disappearance. There were no signs of trauma to Aria’s bones, according to medical examiners, and decomposition was too advanced for any wounds to be detected; ultimately no cause of death was able to be determined. 

Aria had had run-ins with the law, and was on probation at the time of her disappearance, having been ordered to pursue substance abuse treatment in lieu of conviction on charges of theft in Montgomery County, Ohio in 2011. 

According to Vandalia, Ohio police detectives, reports of a naked woman being chased by men in a van on Gettysburg Avenue – on the crime and poverty-stricken west side of Dayton – though initially reported in the local media as likely related, were later ruled out, as DNA found on clothing left at the scene was not a match for Aria. The man who was supposedly present when Aria was killed was discovered to have been in prison at the time of her death. And the jewelry supposedly found in the possession of Aria’s female friend couldn’t be positively identified by family members.

Police got a call about a year after Aria’s death claiming that some clothing and a VIP coupon from The Harem had been found in an abandoned factory in Dayton, but a group of homeless residents squatting in the building claimed those items had been there since long before Sept. 2013. A man cleaning out an apartment where Aria had once lived in Trotwood, meanwhile, contacted Aria’s mother after finding the young woman’s social security card, prompting her mom to contact police. But nothing came of the potential lead, and the man who found the card has been cooperative and forthcoming with investigators. Tips from jailhouse snitches have also failed to pan out.

Finally, surveillance video belatedly released by The Harem shows Aria leaving the club and possibly being followed by a man in a cowboy hat. But that man was identified, according to police, and while cell phone pings confirm he was in Dayton earlier that evening, the same evidence places him in Columbus at the time Aria’s death is believed to have taken place.

570,janiceian1983,[],1636988554,"**13th of September, 1969.** 

**Montreal-Nord, QC, Canada.**

&amp;#x200B;

It was around 3:30 am when Pierre Cyr, a resident of Montreal-Nord came home to his apartment at 6775 Henri-Bourassa blvd. on the 13th of september 1969. As he was about to climb up the stairs to his apartment, Mr. Cyr noticed a teenager sitting against the wall facing the parking of the Vieux Cyprès tavern, next door. Seeing that it was very cold that morning and that she was not wearing any shoes, he approached her and tried to talk to her to see if she was okay. She was unresponsive and Mr. Cyr quickly climbed up the stairs to his apartment to call emergency services. She was brought to the Sacred Heart hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Location of the apartment building and bar (which have been since demolished) in this 2007 Google streetview shot: [https://www.google.com/maps/place/6775+Boul+Henri-Bourassa+E,+Montr%C3%A9al-Nord,+QC/@45.610928,-73.6072775,3a,49.6y,14.63h,92.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sj\_s-By8xJTlD7QeDMInb5g!2e0!7i3328!8i1664!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91fb0e51d02a9:0xa2dcc3f8ed9c8285!8m2!3d45.6117716!4d-73.6064097](https://www.google.com/maps/place/6775+Boul+Henri-Bourassa+E,+Montr%C3%A9al-Nord,+QC/@45.610928,-73.6072775,3a,49.6y,14.63h,92.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sj_s-By8xJTlD7QeDMInb5g!2e0!7i3328!8i1664!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cc91fb0e51d02a9:0xa2dcc3f8ed9c8285!8m2!3d45.6117716!4d-73.6064097)

A few hours later, a worried father would call the police to report the disappearance of his daughter. The father of Teresa Martin told the police that his daughter had left home the evening prior to see a movie at the Galleries d'Anjou shopping center's movie theatre and had not come home. 

Her friends confirmed that Teresa had boarded the number 41 bus at 11 pm after leaving the movie theatre. The bus driver was also questioned and he told the police that he remembered dropping Teresa at the corner of Gouin and Rolland, 2 blocks away from the Martin home. This was the last time she was seen alive.

The police would then link the body discovered that morning with the disappeared teenager. Her father would positively identify Teresa as the victim later that day.

In his report, the coroner would conclude that Teresa had died from being suffocated with an external object that had blocked her airways. She had not been raped and her body did not contain traces of alcohol or drugs.

A perplexing detail noted during the autopsy was that whoever had killed Teresa had also used a knife to carve the words ""F.V. Frency I love you"" on her belly.

One thing to know about the location where Teresa got off the bus is that while it's now a very developped residential area, back in 1969, it was still pretty much a field with no houses and no street lighting. She would have pretty much walked in complete darkness for the 300 metres seperating her from her home on Leger boulevard.

More than 30 people had been interrogated by the police about the crime, but no arrest would ever be made in the case.

A year later, the police would still be interrogating Montreal-Nord teens about the incident and a 14 year-old girl, named Johanne H. would mention crimes that had been committed by a biker gang. ""Brutes"" that had been invited by the Montreal police to settle down in the borough.

&amp;#x200B;

**United Motorcyclist of Quebec**

Around the late 60s, the city of Montreal had a big problem. Biker gangs would go to war against each other, would intimidate citizens and would trigger repeated complaints to the Montreal Police department.

In 1969, a young police officer named John Dalzell had an idea (a very misguided idea, some would later say). He would start an initiative to make the biking world around Montreal more ""acceptable"". With the help of the Quebec government, he would start the ""United Motorcyclists of Quebec"" association. The goal of this association was officially to ""promote the sport of motorcycling and developping a camaraderie between different biker gangs"". He was quoted saying that ""it is important not to suppress this kind of lifestyle but to make it more acceptable to the general public"" by the Gazette in an article published around that time.

One of the ways to raise ""acceptance"" for bikers was to allocate them a designated space where they could meet up and ride their bikes. The city would strike a deal with the oil company BP to let them use a vacant lot they owned on Henri-Bourassa boulevard in Montreal-Nord.

It was originally thought to be a success. And the biker asociation would state that it now had a ""tight control on their club and that all they were doing was enjoying riding their motorbikes in that allocated lot"".

The reality however was, according to local resident, very different.

In an interview done in may of 1970 about the death of Teresa Martin, Johanne H. the teen girl previously mentionned would tell investigators that she and her friends would spend time with some of the UMQ bikers and that they often would act like ""brutes"", often intimidating people, and would often threaten girls with violence should they face rejection from them. 

She also said that the bikers would often ""splash"" teen girls. When asked to explain what she meant by that, she explain that they would collectively force themselves on a girl to get sexual favours from her. And the should a girl refuse to give said favours, they would threaten her with physical violence. She also added that some of them would use a knife to carve words on their skin. She admited that she had been herself a victim of a ""splash"" and had stopped hanging around bikers ever since.

She finally told the investigators that she had heard rumours that Teresa Martin had been murdered by a member of the UMQ bikers but that she didn't personally know them or ever met them. The investigators tried to get more details but Johanne would tell them that this was a rumour she had heard from many people but didn't know the orignal source.

Teresa's family are very confused by Johanne's story. Teresa was a very shy, very introverted person who didn't have many friends and generally prefered a very sedate lifestyle. Not at all the kind of person who would hang around bikers. 

The case has unfortunately remained cold since the 70s and no new lead has popped up regarding it. At this point, the family hopes that DNA testing could be done on the clothes she was wearing back on that night of 1969 and that with the advances in the technology that a culprit could be identified after all those years. 

They also are very critical of the Sureté du Québec's (Quebec provincial police) apparent disinterest in Teresa's case and their very slow work speed and lack of results in all those years. They call the fact that all that's been done in the last ten years was to publish a small article on their unsolved cases website ""incredibly lazy"" and that their passive approach of waiting for a phone call from a popssible witness would most likely never result in any closure of the case. They finally bring attention to the fact that since 2004, the cold case unit at the Quebec Provincial police has only solved 11 cases in almost 20 years. A pathetic score, in their eyes.

She was clothed in a blue, long-sleeved button up blouse; a white bra; gray slacks with a stretch panel; long blue or gray knit socks; and a blue nylon jacket. She also wore a gold ring with an opal and two diamonds. Officials determined the woman to be Caucasian with brown hair, approximately 18-22 years old, and about 5’3” – 5’7” tall. No cause of death could be determined, but investigators suspect foul play. Initial indications were she had been dead for up to 8 months.

576,iMaryJane1,[],1636935895,"After more than 50 years, the man responsible for one of the most notorious bank robberies in Ohio history has been identified.

Theodore John Conrad was only 20 years old when he robbed the Society National Bank in Cleveland on July 11, 1969, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Conrad worked as a teller at the bank, and on the day of the robbery he stashed $215,000 or around $1.7 million in 2021 dollars in a paper bag and simply walked out the door. Because the robbery happened on a Friday, the bank was not aware of anything amiss until the following Monday morning, when they checked the vault and found the money gone, the Marshals said.

Conrad, unsurprisingly, did not show up for work that Monday. He had a two-day head-start on law enforcement, and managed to avoid capture for 52 years.

It wasn't until earlier this month that U.S. Marshals based in Cleveland discovered that a man named Thomas Randele was, in fact, Conrad. Randele lived in Lynnfield, Mass., and had been living in a suburban neighborhood since the 1970s until he died of lung cancer in May at the age of 71.

The Marshals said they made the discovery after matching paperwork that Conrad had filled out in the 1960s with documents that Randele had filled out later in life including a 2014 filing for bankruptcy.

She was a young female found murdered in a wooded area in Germany. She had been raped, strangled, and burned alive. Unspecified evidence has proven that she was killed by a relative and efforts were made to conceal her identity.

Her age is estimated to be between 14-22 years old and her race is unknown, some people have speculated that she may have been of Turkish descent but I personally believe it’s more likely that she is Indian or Pakistani as this seems most likely to be an honour killing (been studying honour crime in criminology and this is way too similar to other cases of honour killings so I’m 90% sure that this is the case)

Supposedly she was found in an area that most foreigners wouldn’t have known about hinting that the killer was local but idk how someone could keep a missing family member secret for so many years.

https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/missing-in-america/family-continues-desperate-search-robby-gallagher-who-went-missing-oahu-n1283863

Robby Gallagher grew up in San Diego. His father taught scuba diving and skippered boats. Robby had a natural love for the ocean, especially surfing. After graduating college with degrees in philosophy and business, he moved to Oahu. He returned to California in 2016 after his father died unexpectedly, but moved back to Hawaii before long.

In September 2020, months into the pandemic, Robby’s family began seeing a decline in his mental health. “The isolation really got to him,” his brother said. “For a while he couldn’t even go out to body surf. I think it really messed with his mind.” Robby’s family attempted to get him help, but he declined, insisting that surfing was his therapy.

Robby's mother last spoke to her son on Halloween of 2020. To my knowledge, there is no information about their last conversation. It was the height of the pandemic, so it was difficult for the family to get to Robby. After waiting several days for COVID test results, Robby's mother was finally able to catch a flight to Hawaii on November 9. She discovered that Robby was last seen acting irrationally and local police stopped to help. They asked if he wanted a ride to the hospital and he said yes. So Robby was transported to Kahuku Medical Center on Oahu’s North Shore, but left before being treated.

A few hours later, a woman reported seeing Robby attempting to open a door of a house near the medical center. He had dropped his body surfing fins. Robby's mother visited the house that Robby had been living in with roommates, but no one had seen or heard from him. His belongings were left behind. She later discovered his passport in his room at her home in San Diego.

Robby’s brother continued to call his cell phone. A few days after Robby’s disappearance, someone answered. It turned out to be a passerby who had found the phone on the side of the road in Wahiawa, about 20 miles from the medical center. The phone was given to Robby’s family, but there was nothing that gave them an idea of his whereabouts.

Cathy filed a missing persons report with the Honolulu Police Department and tips of sightings began pouring in. Recently, however, the sightings have been few and far between. None confirmed to have been Robby. This November marks the one year anniversary of Robby's disappearance.

Robby's mother, Cathy, has been to Hawaii four times since her son disappeared. She and Robby's brother, Brian, continue to spread the word and investigate leads. “We’ve become like our own investigators,” she said. “We have the help of a detective and private investigators, but we always feel like we need to do more.”

The family has also set up a Facebook group “Missing Person in Oahu: Robby Gallagher” in order to provide updates on the case, but also as a place where the public can submit tips. They stress that anyone who believes they have a sighting of Robby, should take a photo and immediately call 911. A cash reward is being offered for information that leads to finding Robby.

Cathy and Brian told Dateline that they are extremely thankful for the support of the Oahu community. “The amount of support we’ve received from the community of Oahu has just been incredible,” Brian said. “The kindness they’ve shown us, by offering to hang posters, give us a place to stay, make us meals, it’s been a light during this dark time.”

Brian adds that he doesn’t know what happened to his little brother, or if he’s even still alive, but said he intends to keep searching for as long as it takes. “There’s a chance he’s not here with us anymore,” Cathy said. “But we know he loves us, he knows we love him. I’ll keep praying he’s still alive. And just keep searching until we know otherwise.”

Robby is described as being 6’1” and weighs about 170 pounds. He has dark dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. He may now have a beard and long hair.

Anyone with information on Robby’s whereabouts, should call Crime Stoppers at 808-955-8300. Tips may also be sent anonymously at www.honolulucrimestoppers.org or via the P3 Tips app.

One reason this case speaks to me is I know lots of people experienced mental health crises due the isolation caused by the pandemic. It's something that I feel should be addressed 
more often. Obvious questions concerning this case are whether Robby is alive. If so, where is he? Could he have made it to the mainland? Is it most likely that he perished in the ocean that he loved?","Robby Gallagher, 31 year old surfer last seen in Hawaii, went missing during the height of the pandemic"

The man was described as being white and in his 30s to early 40s. He was discovered by residents off a dirt road near Sylvan Lake. The body was believed to have been there for about five days when discovered. Although authorities could find no immediate cause of death, foul play was suspected due to blood being found on clothing near the body. An autopsy was scheduled for the following day.

I could find no other information on this man and whether or not he was unidentified. He is not listed on the Doe Network.

Ruth Hemphill was an 82-year-old woman who went missing from Oak Ridge, Tennessee in July 2005. Her car was located in early November 2021. Diver and sonarist Jeremy ""Nug"" Sides, who runs the Youtube channel ""Exploring with Nug,"" found the car in Melton Hill Lake. Remains believed to be Mrs. Hemphill's were inside. (note: as of November 13, 2021, the remains are still undergoing official identification)

# Case Background

Miriam Ruth Hemphill (who went by her middle name), of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, disappeared from the Kingsley Road house she shared with husband Bill in 2005. Her car, a tan or beige 1999 Buick Le Sabre, went missing too. Mrs. Hemphill was believed to be distraught at the time of her disappearance. She left a note, speaking about their recently-deceased daughter, Connie, as well as other clues, but it was not specifically a suicide note. She took ""very little money"" and no extra clothing.

Police initially believed Ruth had crashed on one of the countless remote roads around Oak Ridge; they searched wooded areas and sent notices through Knoxville and Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but came up empty. As the months wore on, Oak Ridge Police began to believe she had disappeared of her own volition. Her husband Bill agreed. Ruth had been depressed since the suicide of their daughter, Connie, three months earlier. He later found a newspaper clipping about someone who had driven into the lake and died. Ruth had cut it out. Bill later moved away from Oak Ridge, unable to stay in the house he had shared with his beloved wife. He passed away in 2016. 

# Recent Developments

In 2021, diver Jeremy ""Nug"" Sides set out to research cold cases for his Youtube channel, [Exploring with Nug](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHubEgFJZQahvKeT1vMeng), and came across Ruth Hemphill's case. He decided to use side-scanning sonar to detect anomalies on the bottom of Oak Ridge's Melton Hill Lake. The process was complicated by unrelated cars that had been dumped over the years. (Sides located seven different vehicles on the lakebed) One anomaly, however, particularly resembled Hemphill's car, a 1999 Buick. Further diving revealed the sunken car had the same license plate number. 

Police winched the car out on Wednesday and it was confirmed to be Mrs. Hemphill's. Upon examination, human remains consistent with her build were found inside. No foul play is suspected. The remains are now with the local medical examiner for official identification.

585,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1636767030,"On Friday, December 17, 1971, 19-year-old Jerry Autry spent the evening cruising around his small hometown of Brownstown, Indiana in his Ford Thunderbird convertible with his longtime girlfriend. A senior at Brownstown Central High, Jerry was a star football player and considered very popular and well liked amongst his peers. 

The couple meandered around town looking for something to do before stopping by a house party thrown by a friend of Jerry’s. In attendance at the party were 17-year-old Stanley “Stan”  Robison, and 16-year-old Michael “Mike” Sewell, Jerry’s best friends. At approximately midnight, Jerry left the party to take his girlfriend home, agreeing to meet up with Stan and Mike later. 

After dropping his girlfriend off, Jerry went to Stan’s parents home, a large rural farm located just outside of Brownstown. Once there, he found Stan, Mike, and two other teenagers hanging out in a makeshift cabin the boys had constructed together two months prior. 

The cabin, which measured approximately 9 by 15 feet, was a frequent hangout spot for the boys, who spent as much as two nights a week camping out inside. It was constructed of old creosote-coated railroad ties and sheet metal which was used for the roof and ceiling. It had one entrance, and no working windows. (There was one unfinished “window” on hinges but it was secured shut.) Inside was a couch, rug, two cots, and a wood burning stove used for heating the cabin. The small structure was located roughly a quarter mile from the Robison family home in a sparsely wooded area at the edge of open farmland. 

During this time, Stan’s sister, Gerda, had just gotten married and her reception party was underway at the American Legion building. Hoping to score some snacks and drinks from the party, the group loaded into Stan’s Ford Mustang and headed into town. Gerda provided the boys with some drinks and leftover food and around 2:30am, they headed back to the cabin. 

Once back at the Robison farm, Jerry realized he did not have his contact lens case. He and Mike got in Jerry’s car and went to his home in nearby Ewing, Indiana to retrieve it. According to Jerry’s mom, Jerry waited in the car and Mike ran inside. Afterwards, they once again returned to the cabin. They parked Jerry’s car with the headlights facing the entrance to the cabin, something they usually did as the cabin did not have any outside sources of light. 

A short time later, Mike left with the two other friends, while Jerry and Stan remained behind at the cabin. Around 2:45, they returned. One of the teens helped Mike carry firewood before leaving him behind to spend the night with Stan and Jerry. 

The next morning, around 8:30am Gerda went to retrieve her brother and his friends from the cabin, all of whom had promised to help her clean up after the party. To her shock, Gerda found a smoldering pile of ash and metal where the structure once stood. She quickly informed her family and they called authorities. 

When police first arrived on scene, it appeared obvious what had happened. In the 12 degree weather that evening, Stan, Mike, and Jerry had overheated the wood burning stove and it had caught fire while they were asleep. The boys kept a Coleman lantern in the cabin, as well as a can of gasoline. Either could have helped fueled the fire that incinerated the cabin. However, after two days of carefully sifting through the remains of the structure, investigators were faced with a bizarre dilemma; there were only enough bones for two bodies. 

One “set” of bones were found on a metal cot in the cabin along with a lighter. The second “set” of bones were found near where the second cot sat, opposite of the first. Two class rings were also found inside the cabin, one in a small crevice near the bed, the other near the second bed. 

The ring found in the crevice of the cabin had been the least damaged and was determined to undoubtedly belong to Jerry. However, multiple witnesses including his girlfriend, claimed Jerry was not wearing his ring on the night of the fire. 

The second ring which had suffered a significantly greater amount of damage was believed to belong to Stan. It was inspected closely by the local jeweler, but he could not say with confidence the ring belonged to him, only that it was similar to the one Stan owned.

The cabin had burned with such intensity, the boy's skulls and teeth had been mostly cremated. However a leg bone found on one bed was determined to be Jerry’s given his substantial height difference. (Both Stan and Mike were 5’ 8”.)

Although the boy's remains were mostly incinerated in the fire, the county coroner as well as a state pathologist that was called in later, were extremely adamant that there was no possibility a third person's remains were at the scene. Someone was missing, and they believed that someone was Mike. 

Mike was immediately listed as a missing person. Believing he may have wandered, injured, into the woods or into nearby White River, a huge search effort ensued, however no sign of the missing teen was found. What police did find however, was a partially burnt comforter at the edge of the field, along with a pack of cigarettes, and “fresh” cigarette butts. 

Several other unusual clues were found at the scene as well. Jerry’s car had been moved from its normal parking spot. It was found on the opposite side of the cabin and while it had no damage from the smoke or fire, the oil pan was broken in two as though it had been driven over rough terrain. According to the boys who had taken Mike back to the cabin, and the last ones to leave for the evening, the car was still in its usual spot facing the door to the cabin at that time. It was also noted, Jerry’s keys were found in the ignition in the “on” position, and his seat had been adjusted. Jerry was over 6 feet tall, and the driver's seat had been moved nearly all the way forward. 

Rumors of drug use, arson, and murder erupted in the small town hindering the investigation. Several people claimed that Mike was getting into the “LSD scene” and had made a known dealer mad. Others reported seeing the boys with large quantities of marijuana that evening. Some even said Stan was using heroin. Conflicting reports came from witnesses at the party. Locals expressed outrage that the identity of the bones were being solely based on the jewelry found at the scene. Others openly voiced their opinion that Mike was a murderer. 

These rumors instigated discord between the family’s of the boys as well, some of them taking to the newspapers to voice their opinions. However, in the end they all ultimately agreed on one thing, they wanted answers as to what really happened that night. Unfortunately, those answers never came. 

For years after the fire, numerous people reported seeing Mike in towns across Indiana, however those sightings were never confirmed. All three family’s continued to push for a grand jury investigation, but with no concrete evidence of foul play, their continued requests were denied.

Jerry and Stan were laid to rest on the same day, in the same cemetery. Mike’s family attempted to have him declared legally dead, however without proof of death their request was denied. 

Mike has never been found, and the details of the deaths of Jerry Autry and Stan Robison remain a mystery.

Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 was preparing to take off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, and headed towards Beijing Capital International airport. Unfortunately, they never arrived, and what happened to them became one of aviation’s greatest mysteries, unsolved to this day.

The aircraft is a Boeing 777-200ER, and was commanded by 53 year old captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and had been a type rating instructor and a type rating examiner since 2007. He had a total 18,365 hours of flight experience. The first officer was 27 year old Fariq Abdul Hamid. In November 2013, he began training as first officer of Boeing 777-200 aircraft. Flight 370 was his final training flight and he was scheduled to be examined on his next flight. Fariq had accumulated 2,763 hours of flying experience. The last contact made was at 1:19:30. The data indicated that there was about 43,800 kilograms of fuel remaining, and Captain Zaharie made a transition from Lumpur Radar to Ho Chi Minh ACC. 

Lumpur Radar: ""Malaysian three seven zero, contact Ho Chi Minh one two zero decimal nine. Good night.""

Flight 370: ""Good night. Malaysian three seven zero.""

The news media reported several sightings of an aircraft fitting the description of the missing Boeing 777. For example, on 19 March 2014, CNN reported that witnesses including fishermen, an oil rig worker and people on the Kuda Huvadhoo atoll in the Maldives saw the missing airliner. A fisherman claimed to have seen an unusually low-flying aircraft off the coast of Kota Bharu; while an oil-rig worker 186 miles (299 km) southeast of Vung Tau claimed he saw a ""burning object"" in the sky that morning, a claim credible enough for the Vietnamese authorities to send a search-and-rescue mission; and Indonesian fishermen reported witnessing an aircraft crash near the Malacca Straits. Three months later, The Daily Telegraph reported that a British woman sailing in the Indian Ocean claimed to have seen an aircraft afire. 

The Malaysian Airlines flight disappeared in 2014 carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, in what has become one of the world’s biggest aviation mysteries.The initial search, carried out by Malaysia, China, and Australia, was called off in January last year after failing to find any trace of the plane within a 710,000-plus square kilometer area of the Indian Ocean.The search is estimated to have cost some 200 million Australian dollars ($151 million), according to Australia’s minister for infrastructure and transport, Darren Chester. Most of the funds were provided by the Malaysian government. It has been the most expensive search for a missing plane in history.

To this date, no one knows what happened on this fateful night. We may only ponder on what happened, for we may never know. This serves as a reminder, to everyone out there, that wherever you are, on a plane, in your house, at school, remember, cherish everyday, like it is your last. I remain hopeful, and possibly in the future, we may find the plane, and the wreckage, and uncover the full story of what happened to Malaysian Airlines flight 370.

587,MayhemInTheDesert,[],1636747863,"Tony Albanese founded the notorious strip club the Crazy Horse Too just off of the Las Vegas Strip in 1979 (the Crazy Horse Too was the scene of violence against patrons and was also central to a bribery scandal involving several members of the Clark County Commission). However, Albanese's rising career in the adult entertainment industry of Las Vegas was cut short when he suddenly disappeared in May of 1981. Albanese's head and some bone fragments would be discovered the following month in the desert near Needles, California.

Tony Albanese operated a chain of topless bars across Southern California in the 1960's before moving to Las Vegas in the early 70's. After relocating, Albanese invested in commercial properties, including a strip mall at Flamingo and Paradise where the strip club the Crazy Horse Saloon was located. He also created the Tony Albanese Talent Agency (T.A.T.A.) to locate dancers for the strip clubs in which he held an interest. In 1979, Albanese took a more direct role in the adult entertainment industry by buying a 50% interest in a bar on Industrial Road called Billy Jo's the Electric Co., which featured go-go dancers. Albanese took over management of the bar, renamed it to Billy Jo's the Crazy Horse Too, and made topless dancing the central feature of the establishment. 

City and county regulators denied Albanese's request for a license to operate the Crazy Horse Too and banned him from the premises of the Crazy Horse Saloon due to his prior citations for serving alcohol to minors and permitting lewd acts between staff and patrons at his bars in California. 

But Albanese persisted with his entrepreneurial efforts. In early 1981, he was working with a group of investors from Southern California to raise $200,000 to open a ""coed spa"" at his Vegas strip mall. At around 6:30 p.m. on May 18, 1981, Albanese told his wife he was going to meet with a person acting as a middleman for the coed spa deal and should return home within an hour. 

Albanese never returned home. 

In the days following his disappearance, Metro police detectives discovered Albanese’s car in the parking lot at McCarran Airport, but there was no indication he had taken a flight out of the city. It also wasn’t like Albanese to stay out all night without checking in with his wife or friends. 

The unexplained disappearance was resolved in gruesome fashion the following month when Tony Albanese’s head was found in the desert outside of Needles, California by a camper. The skull showed no signs of trauma, and homicide detectives were unable to conclusively determine the cause of death. 

Some detectives speculated that Albanese’s murder was part of a broader organized crime war for control over adult industry establishments in Southern California and Las Vegas. No arrests were ever made in relation to Albanese's kidnapping and death.

589,NickNash1985,[],1636738284,"The bodies of Brian Goff and Joni Davis have been located in their vehicle, submerged in the Ohio River near Rayland, Ohio more than three years after disappearing.

I've been following this case since their disappearance and have covered the story on my [web show Crime Stoppers](https://fb.watch/9emHiG8_bJ/).

Brian and Joni lived together with Brian's brother Colin in Martins Ferry, Ohio. On June 10th, 2018, the two had dinner at Pizza Hut in St. Clairsville, OH. After leaving, they were spotted on a security camera driving north on Ohio Route 7 towards Rayland, Ohio where Colin's girlfriend lived.

A little background on Brian and Joni: Joni had suffered a complication with her brain many years prior. This left her mentally incapacitated; she was functional, but did require round-the-clock care. After the death of her mother (who was also her caretaker), Brian stepped up, taking classes to become her legal caretaker.

Brian and Joni were EXTREMELY routine-oriented. They often did the same things at the same times every day. Brian would lay out their cash for the week in specific piles along with Joni's medications. Sunday was Pizza Hut night, and the staff knew their orders before they even sat down. After dinner at Pizza Hut, they would drive to Wheeling Island for a candy bar and a pack of cigarettes, then swing by Arby's for Joni's iced tea. This happened every week.

On June 10th, 2018, they left Pizza Hut, but never made their stops on Wheeling Island. They were never seen alive again.

Brian's brother Colin, while technically residing with Brian and Joni, often spent most of his time at his girlfriend's house on Rush Run Road near Rayland, OH. On June 10th, it was alleged that he asked Brian to bring a few of his things up to her house for him. This is believed to be the reason that Brian and Joni broke from their routine on that day, driving north towards Rayland, passing their home in Martins Ferry.

Since their disappearance, Colin and his girlfriend have been confirmed as Persons of Interest by both the Belmont County Sheriff's Office and the FBI, and there is reason to believe they were the last people to see Brian and Joni alive.

Despite the involvement of the Belmont County Sheriff's Office and later the FBI, their bodies and vehicle remained missing for more than three years.

Yesterday, their vehicle was located in the Ohio River in Rayland, OH - near the entrance to Rush Run Road.

Upon extracting the vehicle from the river, it was confirmed that the bodies of Brian Goff and Joni Davis were inside with their seatbelts still on.

NOW - there's still a lot to figure out about this case, but finding their bodies is a step in the right direction. I've spoken with multiple reporters and law enforcement officers about this. The case is being handled with suspicion, and could potentially be treated as a homicide. 

I'm working with WTRF-7 to continue to acquire details, and will post an update when I have anything new.

590,JamesRenner,[],1636730966,"Pete Elliott, US Marshal for the Cleveland office, just issued the following press release concerning the fate of Ted Conrad, a fugitive his family has been hunting for 52 years. Conrad was a young man, in 1969, who fell in love with the movie, The Thomas Crown Affair, and devised a plan to steal around 200,000 in cash from the bank where he worked in Cleveland. On his birthday, he simply walked out of the vault with the cash tucked in a brown paper bag which the security guard thought held whiskey. Conrad was never seen again.

Elliott's father was Marshal at the time and his son inherited the case. The elder Elliott passed away in 2020. 

As it turns out Ted had been living in the Boston area and had changed his name to, Thomas, of course.

Here's some excellent reports on the mystery:

[80's Cleveland TV news report.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT6zGSR35bo&amp;t=6s)

[Cleveland Plain Dealer.](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2008/01/theodore_john_conrad_the_fbi_h.html)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cleveland, Ohio–** On Friday July 11, 1969, Theodore John Conrad walked into his job at the Society National Bank at 127 Public Square in Cleveland as an ordinary bank teller. He walked out at the end of the day with $215,000 (equivalent to over $1.7 million in 2021) in a paper bag and vanished. Conrad, age twenty, pulled off one of the biggest bank robberies in Cleveland, Ohio history. It was not until the following Monday morning when Conrad failed to report to work, that the bank checked their vault only to find the missing money along with their missing employee. From there Conrad, and the money he stole, had a two-day head start on law enforcement. 

A year before the Cleveland bank robbery, Conrad became obsessed with the 1968 Steve McQueen film “The Thomas Crown Affair.” The movie was based on the bank robbery for sport by a millionaire businessman, and Conrad saw it more than a half dozen times.  From there he bragged to his friends about how easy it would be to take money from the bank and even told them he planned to do so.   

The fugitive investigation into Theodore ‘Ted’ Conrad has perplexed many investigators over the past 50 years. Conrad has been featured on *America’s Most Wanted* and *Unsolved Mysteries*. Investigators chased leads across the country, including Washington D.C., Inglewood, California, western Texas, Oregon, and Honolulu, Hawaii. 

The case remained cold until this past week when United States Marshals from Cleveland, Ohio travelled to Boston, Massachusetts and positively identified Thomas Randele of Lynnfield, Massachusetts as the fictitious name of Theodore J. Conrad. He had been living an unassuming life in the Boston suburb since 1970.  Ironically, he moved to Boston near the location where the original Thomas Crown Affair movie was filmed. 

United States Marshals investigators from Cleveland were able match documents that Conrad completed in the 1960s with documents Randele completed, including documents from when Randele filed for Bankruptcy in Boston Federal Court in 2014. Additional investigative information led Marshals to positively identifying Thomas Randele as Theodore J. Conrad.  

Thomas Randele died of lung cancer in May of 2021 in Lynnfield, Massachusetts using a date of birth as July 10, 1947. His real date of birth was July 10, 1949, and Conrad would have been 71 at the time of his death.  

Peter J. Elliott, United States Marshal for Northern Ohio, stated “This is a case I know all too well. My father, John K. Elliott, was a dedicated career Deputy United States Marshal in Cleveland from 1969 until his retirement in 1990. My father took an interest in this case early because Conrad lived and worked near us in the late 1960s. My father never stopped searching for Conrad and always wanted closure up until his death in 2020. We were able to match some of the documents that my father uncovered from Conrad’s college days in the 1960s with documents from Randele that led to his identification. I hope my father is resting a little easier today knowing his investigation and his United States Marshals Service brought closure to this decades-long mystery. Everything in real life doesn’t always end like in the movies.”",Breaking News - Ted Conrad found after 50 years on the run.
591,antennniotva,[],1636725046,"In London during the summer of 1897 there were over 25 bodies found in the River Thames, with 17 of them being found within the short span of just three weeks, and many of the investigations having never reached a formal conclusion on what led to the drowned bodies. (For reference, in the present day, around 30 bodies a year are found in the Thames with a high percentage of them being classified as suicides).

In researching this I wanted to find out if possibly [Jack the Ripper](https://www.jack-the-ripper.org/), or another serial killer, could be responsible for a large majority of these deaths. The M.O. or reasoning for killing could've changed after 10 years. After all, Whitechappel was a 20-minute walk from the London area where a majority of these deaths occurred, and it’s happened before in more modern times, with the BTK killer waiting nearly eight years between two of his victims.

June 22nd of 1897 was the set date for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee to enter London. This was a huge deal not only because the Diamond Jubilee is a celebration for the 60th year of a ruler's reign, but also because in 1896, Queen Victoria had just surpassed her father as the longest-reigning monarch in British History. but wanted to save the celebration until 1897. In the weeks leading up to the Jubilee, officials were preparing for the Queen’s arrival and were preoccupied with assembling the festivities. Additionally, there were many citizens arriving in London throughout June to join in the Queen’s celebration activities. Seeing as JTR had thrived on the influx of immigrants to England in 1888, there is a possibility that whomever (if anyone) terrorized London in 1897 had the same mindset.

^(Sorry in advance for the long write-up. If you're more of a visual person, I did make a video outlining this writeup to help visualize the findings along the Thames more easily.)

**So what was going on near the River Thames in the summer of 1897?**

For easy readability, all deaths have been outlined by date below. Since these events happened over 120 years ago, some dates may be off due to newspaper discreprencies, but this list is the most accurate based on newspapers at the time.

Additionally, I'll make note of the legal verbiage of the time. In this case, the verdict of “*found drowned*” means that there was no foul play suspected in the death. Alternatively, an “*open verdict*” means that the death is suspicious and jurors were not able to come to a conclusion on what the cause of death was.

**June 3rd** \- An unknown man commits suicide off of the London Bridge. He was never identified.

**June 4th** \- A naked woman referred to as *Bangle Woman* was found in the River Thames near North Woolwich by a dock laborer on his way to Albert Docks. The name came from the fact that she was found wearing nothing except for two bangles, one on each wrist. She was approximately 30y.o. and though many attempts had been made to identify her, she remains unidentified. The woman was found with deep lacerations across her entire face and bruises on her limbs, originally thought to have been done in an attempt to prevent her from being identified. It was questioned whether the cuts had been made pre or post-mortem, and whether they could have been done by a passing ship propeller. In either case, the coroner returned an open verdict stating that that the bruises had been inflicted prior to death and the jury assumed she had probably been a victim of foul play.

**June 4th** \- A man named John Maben was ruled to have taken his own life and was found off of the river near Woolwich, passing away of pneumonia and immersion in the Woolwich Union Infirmary.

**June 5th** \-  A man named Edmund was found in the river after the collision of two ships in the River Thames. Ruled an accidental death.

**June 6th** \- A man named Walter (23) was found in Grosvenor Canal after heading to work. Though he had stated to a friend that he had just gotten out of a relationship with a girl, the jury did not believe this contributed to his death and returned an open verdict.

**June 10th** \- A man named  William Turner attempted suicide from the Tower Bridge, but was later saved by a passing police boat. He did live, but was jailed as suicide was considered a crime in London until 1961.

**June 10th** \- A man around the age of 20 was found in Chamberlain’s Wharf. The coroner stated that he'd been in the water around three months. He remains unidentified and an unknown verdict returned.

**June 10th** \- A body found in Rotherhithe. Unknown victim and unknown verdict.

**June 10th** \- A body found in Bertmondsey. Unknown victim and unknown verdict.

**June 11th** \- A woman named Mary Ann Coleman who was widowed and had recently discharged herself from a workhouse was found. Unknown verdict.

**June 11th** \- A woman named Lillian Saints was found in the river. She had been acting weird on the nights before her death. According to newspapers, she had been courting a man named George, though he was never charged with her death. She left her home on the night of her death and was found drowned in the river the next morning with a small bottle of gin on her person. An open verdict was returned.

**June 12th** \- An unidentified man in ragged clothing near Temple Station was found. I could not find any evidence that he was ever identified.

**June 12th** \- An accidental drowning of a man named MacPherson happened from falling into the river after a sunstroke.

**June 16th** \-  The body of Amelia Ward, a chambermaid, was found floating near Mark Brown’s Warf wearing multiple gold and silver rings and clothing made of ""the best material"" including a cloak made of velvet and astrachan. She had been in the water around one week. Word came out that she had been courting a married man, though authorities were never able to tie him to her drowning. Her verdict came back as found drowned due to no obvious signs of trauma. But authorities stated that they were still suspicious of her death, due to not knowing how she ended up in the water.

**June 16th** \- A “*well-dressed man*” around the age of 50 was found in the River Thames at Denton, around two miles away from Gravesend. His hands were tied behind his back and a stone was attached to the cord. He had spoken to multiple pier workers earlier in the day with no sign of suicidal ideation. The man had purchased a boat for a row and no one had heard from him until his body was found. Authorities marked his death as foul play, citing that the man would not have been able to tie the cord behind his back, and that he had been showing a decent amount of money, but only 5 shillings were found on him.

**June 16th** \- An unidentified person was found in the river opposite of the St. Thomas Hospital with a handkerchief marked “C.E Reid, MUOOK” Unknown verdict.

**June 16th** \- An unidentified person was found off the Lion Brewery, Charingcross Bridge. They had several pieces of betting paper in his pocket along with a paper bearing initials “H.B. and B.B.” Unknown verdict.

**June 17th** \- The body of Robert Smith, a tax collector in Wandsworth, was found floating off of the Fresh Wharf at the London Bridge. Unknown verdict.

**June 17th** \- *Two* unidentified bodies found in Westminster in the river. Unknown verdict.

**June 17th** \- An unidentified body found in the river near Silverton. Unknown verdict.

**June 24th** \- A man named John Cooper seized suddenly while bathing and accidentally drowned.

**June 27th** \- An unknown man around the age of 50 was found floating off the Temple by a police officer. Unknown verdict.

**July 8th** \- A man named George Henry Cox was found drowned off of Shadwell. He had stated to another man on the 30th of June that he had a dream that he would be drowned at 8PM that night and nothing had been seen of him since. The jury was unable to determine whether foul play was involved in his death and returned a verdict of found drowned.

**July 10th** \- A “*respectably-dressed young woman*” of roughly 30 years old was found in the River Thames near the Tower Bridge. This woman was never identified. She had a tattoo of the words “I Love F.R.” on her left leg and arm. The woman’s clothing was marked W.R. An open verdict was returned.

**July 29th** \- A “*respectably-dressed young woman*” around the age of 25 was found close to the Needle Steps. She remains unidentified, though she was found shortly after her death according to the coroner. The coroner was not able to find any sign of violence, but the inquest returned an open verdict as the jury could not come to a decision on how she had ended up in the water.

As a note, two more bodies were found outside of the summer timeline. If there was a killer, these could've been connected. But it seems unlikely given the time difference. William Baxter was found in the Thames in September with his throat slashed. As far as I've found, it wasn't solved. Lily Cheeseman, a barmaid, was found in the Thames in October. Lily’s death was considered foul play as well, though it was never solved.

The most likely theory is that this was just a coincidence. Seeing as 5 of the 26 bodies were known suicides/accidents, the rest could've fit into those categories as well. Suicide was a pretty popular practice in the late 1800s.

However, the papers at the time were making a pretty large deal of it. Throughout June and July, multiple papers mentioned how odd it was that there were so many bodies (unidentified ones at that) found in such short concession. There was one paper that even mentioned the fact that JTR could've been back again. Though I'm not sure how likely it is that he would've switched up his M.O. to drowning victims instead of ""ripping"" them, I do think there is a chance (however small) that a serial murderer could've taken advantage of the commotion surrounding the Jubilee.

I also think that many of these deaths could've been one-off killings. Seeing as a few of those found were in secret relationships, or had just gotten out of relationships. If there were emotion-based killings, no one ever paid the price for committing them.

Researching this was a really interesting insight into the life of citizens in 1800s England. Specifically the ""Bangle Woman"" and the two ""respectably dressed"" women along with the Gravesend man were the ones that inspired this deeper look. I'd like to hear anyone else's thoughts on these findings as well, even if it's just ""Oh this is definitely just a coincidence"".

I do feel bad for the families of those who remain unidentified. Even though they're long gone now,  it makes me wonder if they'd thought their loved one moved to London for a better life or more opportunity and never knew what really became of them.",Why were so many bodies found in the Thames in 1897?
592,Zackeezy116,[],1636682440,"Many veterans deal with all kinds of problems when they return from war, and US Marine Daniel Muttscheller was no exception.  Daniel joined the marines in the late 60's when he was 17.  He fought on the front lines during the Vietnam war.  He returned to Saginaw, Michigan with horror stories of what he had witnessed.  Those close to him said that he was not the same person after he got back.  He turned to drugs to cope and developed mental issues that haunted him.  He collected disability to sustain himself.  He lived off of disability from about 1969 until 1982.  His family noticed that he hadn't collected his disability check, which was odd considering it was all he had to live off of, so within the month, his family filed a missing person's report.  His sister, Charlotte Hardy, lives on and continues to hold out hope that he's out there somewhere.  Many other members of his family have since passed away, not knowing what happened to Daniel.  Charlotte says he used to be funny, loving, and caring, but all that vanished after he returned from Vietnam.  After almost 40 years of being missing, what could have happened to him?  His family searched all over Saginaw, and found no trace of him.  Police looked, but to no avail.  No body was found, no notes explaining where he went or what he did, and no one coming forward to say they saw him or might have known where he went.  The family that is left wonders what might have happened.  Did he die?  Is he still alive?  Is he homeless?  Did he experience a mental breakdown?  No trace of him has been found in over 40 years.  What do you think happened?

593,MayhemInTheDesert,[],1636681834,"Tony Albanese founded the notorious strip club the Crazy Horse Too just off of the Las Vegas Strip in 1979 (the Crazy Horse Too was the scene of violence against patrons and was also central to a bribery scandal involving several members of the Clark County Commission). However, Albanese's rising career in the adult entertainment industry of Las Vegas was cut short  when he suddenly disappeared in May of 1981.  Albanese's head and some bone fragments would be discovered the following month in the desert near Needles, California.

Tony Albanese operated a chain of topless bars across Southern California in the 1960's before moving to Las Vegas in the early 70's. After relocating, Albanese invested in commercial properties, including a strip mall at Flamingo and Paradise where the strip club the Crazy Horse Saloon was located. He also created the Tony Albanese Talent Agency (T.A.T.A.) to locate dancers for the strip clubs in which he held an interest. In 1979, Albanese took a more direct role in the adult entertainment industry by buying a 50% interest in a bar on Industrial Road called Billy Jo's the Electric Co., which featured go-go dancers. Albanese took over management of the bar, renamed it to Billy Jo's the Crazy Horse Too, and made topless dancing the central feature of the establishment. 

City and county regulators denied Albanese's request for a license to operate the Crazy Horse Too and banned him from the premises of the Crazy Horse Saloon due to his prior citations for serving alcohol to minors and permitting lewd acts between staff and patrons at his bars in California. 

But Albanese persisted with his entrepreneurial efforts. In early 1981, he was working with a group of investors from Southern California to raise $200,000 to open a ""coed spa"" at his Vegas strip mall. At around 6:30 p.m. on May 18, 1981, Albanese told his wife he was going to meet with a person acting as a middleman for the coed spa deal and should return home within an hour. 

Albanese never returned home.   

In the days following his disappearance, Metro police detectives discovered Albanese’s car in the parking lot at McCarran Airport, but there was no indication he had taken a flight out of the city. It also wasn’t like Albanese to stay out all night without checking in with his wife or friends. 

The unexplained disappearance was resolved in gruesome fashion the following month when Tony Albanese’s head was found in the desert outside of Needles, California by a camper. The skull showed no signs of trauma, and homicide detectives were unable to conclusively determine the cause of death. 

Investigators began by questioning the business associate with whom Albanese was supposed to meet the night of his disappearance, but  the business associate (who was never named in the press coverage of the case) claimed to not have any meeting scheduled the night of May 18th.    

Some detectives speculated that Albanese’s murder was part of a broader organized crime war between the Chicago Outfit and the Genovese Family for control over adult industry establishments in Southern California and Las Vegas – including topless bars, adult theaters and stores, and pornography production. In the early 80's, Chicago Outfit enforcer Tony ""The Ant"" Spilotro was reportedly attempting to make inroads into Southern California where several of the New York crime families already held interests. Another interesting note is that a capo with the Bonanno Crime Family was the shadow owner of the Crazy Horse Saloon and Albanese was close friends with Joseph Balzano, an associate with the Bonanno Family. 

One of the more interesting theories is that Jack Gordon (who would later go on to marry La Toya Jackson and act as her manager) was behind the Albanese murder. Gordon allegedly had a secret interests in adult entertainment establishments across Southern California and was believed by police to have murdered prior business associates, including the June 1, 1981 murder of Albert Fandino in Los Angeles while the search for Albanese was still ongoing. Fandino was not only financially linked to several adult establishments in California as a shadow investor, but he was also a co-owner of a wedding chapel and spa at the Circus Circus in Las Vegas. 

It seems likely the murder of Tony Albanese was related to organized crime, but the specifics of his disappearance and murder - as well as his killers - remain unknown.

Hi all,

I was referred here through a semi-anonymous FB message following the[ news update](https://turnto10.com/i-team/nbc-10-i-team-was-it-a-seizure-or-murder) of my dad's 15 year old homicide cold case.

My dad was found in his basement apartment where he was living in Cranston, Rhode Island. He was 34 years old. Initial reports state 911 was called for a medical call, specifically a report of a male having a seizure. Admittedly, seizures were not *uncommon* for my father but the scene proved it was more than just that.

Shawn O'Brien worked on Friday, 7/21/06. Around 5:30 pm his girlfriend and their daughter visited the apartment with plans to visit a local festival that night. Plans changed as his daughter had a headache. Shawn told his girlfriend to drop him off at Billy's Frosted Mug, a local bar, because he didn't want to be home that night. Shawn's upstairs neighbor and 'landlord' (the apartment was sublet through him), Armand Rouleau and his girlfriend Lynn Hallal were home. Shawn reported he didn't want to be home with Lynn as she had threatened him previously and tensions were running high. Around 6pm Shawn calls his sister Erin to see if she was around to hang out but with no answer, he was dropped off at Billy's Frosted Mug alone around 6:10 pm.

Shawn was supposed to report to work around 7-8 am the next morning. He never showed. Around 6pm his sister, Karen, went by the apartment. When she arrived Armand allegedly ran outside and yelled ""come in quick, Shawn's been in a seizure for over an hour."" Karen calls 911 and reports Shawn in a seizure with blood pooling under his head. Shawn was found laying on the floor, on his stomach, with his feet facing the door. A large pool of blood was found under his head coming from a head wound. The mattress was covered with large blood stains. Cranston Police note that the scene is orderly and there are no visible injuries. It is not sealed as a crime scene.

He is brought to RI Hospital where medical treatment begins. Doctors know right away that this is not a seizure but the result of foul play. However, no doctors contact the police department. Shawn's family reach out to police on three separate instances in an effort to seal the apartment for evidence. The apartment is not sealed.

Shawn has brain swelling from blunt force trauma to his head. He has multiple cuts, abrasions, and bruises. He ultimately passes away from the head trauma on Tuesday, 7/25/06.

When his girlfriend and sister go to the apartment to retrieve some of his belongings, they note additional blood stains that have been covered by various objects. They note blood on the floors, walls, doors, dining room chairs, bureaus, pillows, and blankets. Armand is present and reports ""no one came in, no one came out"". His nephew, John Rouleau, reports ""Armand didn't have any problems with Shawn."" The police return to the scene and it is sealed on Wednesday, 7/26/06.

When police arrive to seal the scene and begin initial questioning, Armand refuses to talk and requests a lawyer. When questioned about the marks on his face, his girlfriend Lynn admits to getting into an argument and striking him on the previous Friday. She is arrested and charged for this.

Police take extensive amounts of evidence and conduct countless interviews but no progress is made. By their own admission, the police believe Armand and Lynn to be the two prime suspects but without any new evidence or the willingness to cooperate, the case is reaching a dead end.

I'm desperate for help and answers. I have been trying to solve this on my own for months, investing time and resources to get the word out and hopefully someone will come forward but I'm out of my league - I am no detective. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",Shawn O'Brien - 15 year old cold case
595,girlgirly,[],1636675715,"Marta del Castillo disappearance is a very famous case in Spain. And recently they did a Netflix documentary about her. 

The reason why this case is so strange is because: 
1. It’s one of the few cases where a murderer has been sentenced to jail without having the body of the victim as evidence. 
2. Two judges have accepted two different versions of what happened (I will talk about that later)
3. There are  7 different stories about what happened and where the body is.


Marta del Castillo was last seen with her ex boyfriend Miguel Carcaño. He supposedly drove her to the street where she lives and then left. According to her parents every hour or so she would send a sms or call them and then hang up so they would know she was fine. 
When they noticed she wasn’t sending any messages or wasn’t responding to any calls they started looking for her. They knew she was with Miguel so they called Samuel (Miguel’s best friend) and he told them that Miguel left Marta at her house at 24:00. At the time of the call it wasn’t midnight yet. They showed up at Miguel’s house and they noticed it smelled a lot like bleach. Also some neighbours said that they saw Miguel and someone else with a wheelchair around the street.

The cops didn’t start looking for her until 17 hours after they parents reported her as a missing person. 

After that a lot of things happened. But mainly what’s important to know is that the cops found blood in Miguel’s jacket. He was arrested and confessed the crime. 
He and his friends gave 7 different versions of what happened. 

Miguel’s First testimony:
According to this testimony, Miguel murdered Marta during an argument on the night of January 24. The murder weapon was a heavy ashtray which was never found, but that Carcaño claimed to have used to hit Marta on the left side of the head, killing her. Carcaño also claimed to have called a friend, Samuel (his best friend), from a payphone. Then they both moved her body. He used his own motorcycle and then they threw the body in the river. Which was later found to be impossible. It was impossible to fit two adult men (18/19 years old) and a dead body in his motorcycle so this testimony was considered to be fake.

After this Miguel, his older brother Francisco, Samuel  and a second friend “El Cuco” (a minor) were arrested. According to Miguel, El Cuco was also in the apartamento with them.


El Cuco’s first testimony:
According to him he showed up at the apartment after Marta was murdered and was forced to help clean the apartment. Francisco (Miguel’s older brother) would have threatened him into silence. Telling him he would harm his family if he said anything. But he didn’t know where Marta was.

Samuel first testimony:
Samuel (the best friend) gave the same testimony as El Cuco and said that he found Marta dead when he got there and had to help clean up the apartment. 
The cops believed that Miguel and his older brother Francisco were both at home when Marta died and one of them had to kill her. Specially because in a phone call Francisco told Miguel “don’t say anything to the cops, they have nothing”


Miguel’s second version:
In this second statement, Miguel blamed the murder on ""El Cuco"", saying that he had strangled Marta in the apartment living room while Miguel was in the bedroom under the influence of ""substances"". Afterward, he phoned Samuel (best friend) and they disposed of the body in a dumpster. He said he was forced by the cops to admit the crime the first time.

After this “El Cuco” was asked to give another testimony. He said that he never went to that apartment that night. Same as Samuel. They both said they were pressured into the first confession. 

Miguel’s third version:
Just before the trial and realising that the last confession didn’t make sense he said that he was drinking and smoking with El Cuco and Marta in his apartment. Then they tried to have sex with her and when she refused they raped her and later killed her. El Cuco used a knife to threaten her. And they would have killed her together, as they both choked her. 
Then they would have hidden her body in a trash bag and used a wheelchair to take her body outside and throw it in a dumpster. Although the cops weren’t convinced by this it would explain why they found a knife thrown in a sewer in front of the apartment, why they found both El Cuco and Miguel’s DNA at the house and it made sense because someone saw Miguel and a second person with a wheelchair.

However it was also believed that Miguel made up this version right before the trial to avoid a trial by jury and get instead a bench trial. In Spain rape crimes aren’t judged with a trial by jury. After this his lawyer decided to stop defending him. 

Miguel’s fourth testimony:
After the trial starts he denies that he raped her and says that he killed her with an ashtray (goes back to the first version). And then says that his best friend Samuel was the one to throw away the body and therefore he didn’t know where she was. He also made clear that his older brother Francisco wasn’t in the apartment when he and Marta arrived. Therefore he didn’t know anything.

Miguel’s sixth testimony (after he was convicted of murder and was already in jail):
This time he says that his brother killed Marta using a gun. The two brothers were fighting and Marta came in between them. Francisco (older brother) hit her in the head and she died instantly. Then they both carried her in a wheelchair and buried her in a field. According to this last version Samuel (his best friend) didn’t know anything and had nothing to do with the crime. And El Cuco did show up at his apartment but he ran away as soon as she saw her.
This was while he was in jail. Miguel got a 22 years sentence. Which for some people is not enough but even the lawyer of Marta’s family said it’s a lot taking into consideration the lack of evidence. If Miguel didn’t confess maybe none would be in jail.

The older brother never made it to a trial. As there wasn’t enough evidence for him. According to the first judge he wasn’t in the apartment when everything happened and was in the restaurant he owned instead. 
Samuel was also found non guilty as there was no evidence against him.

El Cuco was a minor when everything happened so he got a separate trial in a Juvenile Court. His DNA was found in the apartment where Marta died. He said that he spend a lot of time there and it was like his second home so it was normal his DNA would be there. And it didn’t mean anything at all. However for the judge that was enough to convict him to a 3 years detention in a juvenile center. His past internment would be considered as part of his sentence so he was free in one year.
And because he was a minor he wouldn’t have a criminal record when he turned 18.

Now here’s the controversy: this judge considered El Cuco’s first testimony as true. This means that he got to the apartment and found both Miguel and Francisco there. 

Meanwhile the other judge (the one for the adults) accepted a different version as true and considered that Francisco (older brother) was never there. 

And it was also controversial because this judge found El Cuco innocent of the crime of murder and considered Miguel as the only murderer. But Miguel’s trial didn’t even finish.


A few days ago I read the interview Marta’s dad gave to the press and he thinks El Cuco is innocent and gives Miguel’s last testimony as true. Both him and his older brother were in the apartment and the older brother (who is free) was the one who killed his daughter. However he thinks El Cuco knows where Marta is but is too afraid to say anything. And he also believes that Miguel was forced to take the blame and didn’t give the real version of what happened until he was safe in jail and away of his brother. 

Marta’s dad offered Miguel money, the promise to not try to seek additional charges and that he would be able to live wherever he wanted in Spain (Miguel won’t be able to live near the parents or sisters once he is out of jail) if he told him where his daughter was. Carcaño rejected the offer, saying that it wouldn't ""make up for him.""

A few years ago his father finally visited Miguel in the jail. He said once more that his brother killed Marta. That he changed so many times his story because he was following his brother’s advice and that he didn’t lie about burying Marta in a field. But that his older brother probably changed the location of the body. Therefore he knows nothing.
And  Marta’s father believes him. 


Right now both El Cuco and Samuel live in France. There was an interview that went viral from a few years ago where he hints that Miguel didn’t kill Marta (and therefore Francisco did). He looks extremely nervios and anxious. 

But the reality is that everything is still a mistery. Who killed Marta, where si she now? Maybe we will never know.

Now something that I didn’t mention before is that all this families are very humble. They are all working class families with medium to low income. But the older brother Francisco at that time was supposedly dating the daughter of an important politician in Andalusia (place where it all took place). Nothing is known about her but the rumours say she comes from a wealthy family. But I guess that would explain how he was able to scare El Cuco and his own brother. 

Right now both El Cuco and Samuel live in France. There was an interview that went viral from a few years ago where he hints that Miguel didn’t kill Marta (and therefore Francisco did). He looks extremely nervios and anxious.

Video evidence proves suicide in the manner he was found dead was physically impossible. 

His mom had to hire her own search dogs, because Lafayette cops didn't give a shit about saving him, while Alex was still alive. 

Private individuals had to search for him while he was still alive, because the Lafayette PD didn't care if he lived or died. 

Lafayette cops were openly transphobic and disparaging to his mother. Telling her they refused to search for him. Woah. Yes, you read that right. To her face, they told her thry didn't give a shit and he was a bad kid. They were half right. He was a kid. 21 years old, and dead. 

So then he was found. Obviously murdered. 

Immediately the cover up began. City employees were pressured not to talk to his mother. She had to wait 11 months to read the report of how he died. Jesus fucking christ, these are cops of the 'do nothing libby and abby' strain- delphi is 20 min from here. That motherfucker will never be brought to justice either, because small towns are where tf to murder people and get away with it, even if they have you on video, its fine. You'll never be found. 

So back to Alex. Because he was trans, because at birth he was Jasmine, the cops here have never given a fuck- from before he was even dead. 

Nice place to live! If you are even slightly different, and you go missing, then are murdered, you can count on the Lafayette PD to never give a fuck. 

That you tube link is a 3 part series. The evidence, and the cover up are disgusting. 

And meanwhile, Alex is still dead. 

This sub want me to write 750 words about this, or they won't publish it.  I have cried more than 750 tears over this.

I am writing this from my phone, I have to go to work in a few hours, I need to go to sleep. I dont know if this is 750 words or not. Fuck, I am tired. I miss Alex. I wish I had a shitload of money to do a proper investigation but I don't. I have only swet equity. God fucking dammit, how do I do a word count on my phone? God I am tired. 

You know, the bullshit part of reddit refusing to publish a post, is i cant even copy and paste old attempts to post this. My first version of this story was much, MUCH better than this. But alas, lost to the ages. That one, didn't have a link to the You Tube series. Round 2, not long enough. Oh my fucking God, really? 

If you Google Alexander Van Delsen, and stumble upon the Journal and Courier story, God, the transphobia in the comments will make you literally sick to your stomach. All those ass holes should go fuck them selves with a cactus. If you are trans phobic, and would like to post here, instead, send me your add ress and I'll mail you a free cac tus!

 Sheriff Chris Swanson announced Michael Bur, a 41-year-old man from Lennon, was arraigned on Thursday morning on one count of felony murder, criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, and kidnapping.  

Within the last 24 hours, Swanson said investigators developed a lead based on a scientific analysis. Burr was taken into custody at his home, which is very close to where Prieur’s murder happened, Swanson said.

Burr remains lodged in the Genesee County Jail with no bond. Swanson promised to release more details on the case on Wednesday, Nov. 17.

&amp;#x200B;

 Burr would have grown up in Prieur’s neighborhood, Swanson said, and was in 11th grade at the time of her murder.

599,WinterLeia10,[],1636654264,"All stories are journey, whether true or fictitious. It’s the account of how a person got from point A to point B. Hence, unsolved crimes are merely stories that are missing pieces, or maybe just one crucial piece that would complete the plot. Yet, they still lay there, an unfinished manuscript on some shelf in a police department with the pages yellowing and turning to dust.

Of course, if a crime is popular enough, many try to parse together the missing pieces by using what is there to come to a reasonable conclusion about how the story. Such an approach is a double-edged sword, however, as facts can be mixed with fiction. The case may become littered with factoids, bits of information believed to be true by the majority of people investigating it, when, in fact, they are false or have been called into serious question. Due to that and my own curiosity about the case, I recently obtained the police file from the Kansas City police department about a case known as the Murder in Room 1046, and the story within the police files, although still fragmentary, tell something of a different narrative than what most accounts of the crime tell.

Here is a basic overview of the crime:

https://kchistory.org/blog/mystery-room-1046-pt-1-roland-t-owen
https://kchistory.org/blog/mystery-room-1046-pt-2-love-forever-louise


If you have even a basic knowledge of this crime, you probably assume that the story begins with a adventurous young man by the name of Artemus Ogletree, who left a loving home in Alabama to hitchhike across the country without a care in the world. But in that you would be wrong, for unraveling the mystery behind an unsolved crime always begins at the scene of the crime. We are not the young man, or his worried and heartsick parents, or his mysterious friend. We are the police who received a call around 11 AM on January 4, 1935 from the Hotel President in Kansas City, MO. The hotel also called Dr. Oglesby, but due to the fact that he couldn’t get away at the moment, he asked that a colleague named Dr. Flanders respond to the summons. Dr. Flanders agreed and was told to ask for assistant manager Mr. Weaver when he arrived. Once there, he was led to room 1046 by Mr. Weaver and a bellboy named Harold Pike. The room was locked and the lights were off when they first entered, but as soon as the lights were flipped on, he could see that the situation was a bit more serious than a drunk guest having hurt himself in a state of inebriation. The first thing Dr. Flanders noticed was blood-stained bed clothes on the floor at the foot of bed and a smear of blood on the wall to the left, close to the outside entrance. The bathroom light was on, and the doctor saw a man’s foot by the bathtub. When he entered he saw that the man, who was nude, was sitting on the side of the tub with his feet outside of it and his arms and head draped over the washbowl.

Being the good doctor he no doubt was, Dr. Flanders first noticed that the man was breathing, which was a good sign. What wasn’t a good sign was that he had a cord that looked like a clothesline tied around his neck, around both wrists, and his feet were also tied together. After freeing the man from these cords with scissors from his bags, Dr, Flanders, realizing the man had been the victim of a violent crime, sent Mr. Weaver to fetch police immediately while he and the bellboy helped the man to stand and then carried him into the other room and laid him on the bed. At that point, Dr. Flanders made a few other observations. He noticed the man had a wound on his body that was about ½ inch long, just outside of his nipple line and two inches below his heart, that there was dried blood covering his face and scalp, and his left eye was badly swollen.

A possible factoid at this point is the assertion that when asked who did this to him, Owen answered with something to the effect that no one did and he fell out of the bathtub. This assertion is not supported in the police file, which only states that he “mumbled incoherently”. And by the time the police arrived he had lapsed into unconsciousness and never regained consciousness. A local newspaper attributed the piece of information to Dr. Flanders. However, if Dr. Flanders did say that, he did not include it in his statement to the police, and the statement of the only other person in the room at that point, the bellboy Harold Pike, also does not include the information.
While the doctor was still there, the police and ambulance arrived. After calling General Hospital to talk to Dr. Jennett, the man was rushed to the hospital. Perhaps the most important observation that Dr. Flanders made is noting that some of the blood was absolutely dry, leaving him to estimate that whatever had caused the wound itself must have happened six or seven hours previous to his arrival, or between 4 and 5 am that very morning.

Although not in the police files, newspaper reports stated that the label to a necktie, a hairpin, a safety pin, an unsmoked cigarette, and a small bottle of diluted sulphuric acid were the only things found in the hotel room after the man was taken to the hospital. This inventory list is likely to be true and there is some collaboration for it, as police tried to track down the tie label until they realized the tie was sold all over the country and wouldn’t help them figure out where the victim came from.

An item of information that does need to be taken with a grain of salt is the fingerprints found on the phone, which are attributed to a woman because of their small size. Several accounts claim that the fingerprints were not a match  to Owen or any of the hotel staff. In actual fact, there’s no evidence these fingerprints even existed in the police file. In addition, the doctor who performed the autopsy on Owen noted that the man had unusually small hands for his stature and physique. It also cannot be ruled out that a prior guest left the fingerprints. The housemaid even mentioned that a woman had been staying in room 1046 before Owen checked in.

Sadly, the man succumbed to his wounds around midnight on January 5, 1935. The attending physician, Dr. Hagan, advised that he had several bruises on his head and that the cut over his heart only went as far as the lung. However, the fatal injury were three skull fractures. The autopsy would paint an even more graphic picture of the suffering this man went through. He had abrasions wounds encircling his wrist and ankles, no doubt due to the cords, as well as one on his right jaw. The wound that Dr. Flanders noticed on his chest was a small, oval, penetrating wound that had not hit any vital organs. In addition, he had irregular, lacerated wounds in front of his right ear as well as four almost half-moon shaped contused lacerations of the scalp above the right ear. And, of course, the compound skull fracture, which was the cause of death. (A footnote on the autopsy states that several people claimed Owen talked with a southern accent).

And with that, the Kansas City Police Department had a homicide on their hands, one that still defies explanation all these years later.

Of course, as the majority of murder victims are killed by someone they know, the police knew that they needed to find out as much information about the victim as they could and what events led up to his brutal, mysterious death at the hands of an unknown assailant or assailants. As far as a physical description, the victim was a handsome, young man with brown hair and blue eyes. He was very well-developed, stood 5’11 and had an athletic physique, like a football player or a wrestler. And he had a cauliflower ear, which is an injury common in contact sports, like football and wrestling. As for his age, the majority of people put him in his mid-twenties. 

The police quickly found out that the man had registered under the name of Roland T. Owen at the Hotel President at 1 pm, on Tuesday, January 1. Bellboy Randolph Propst was present and accompanied the man up to Room 1046. The salient characteristics of Mr. Owen that he remarked on was that he was very well-spoken and was very neatly dressed, although the only piece of clothing the bellboy could remember Owen wore specifically was a black overcoat. The conversation Propst had with Owen while riding up the elevator would also provide the police with an important clue, as Owen mentioned that he had stayed at the Muehlback Hotel the night before and had left because the price of $5.00 was far too steep for him. In 1935, $5.00 was the equivalent of around $100.00 today.

Bizarrely, Owen carried no luggage at all, and the only items he seemed to have to his name were the clothes on his back, a black hairbrush, a black comb, and toothpaste. These latter items he placed in his room, and then he left along with the bellboy. They had already started toward the elevator when Propst realized that Owen had not locked the door and asked for his guest key, so he could go back and lock it. He did so, and then gave the key back to Owen, after which the two parted ways and would not cross paths again until the morning of the assault.


An important thing to understand for this particular crime is how the locks worked in the Hotel President in 1935, because of the implications such an mechanism has on Owen’s murder. Each guest is given one key and one key only when they check in. In addition, the staff at Hotel President also has a master key for each room. If the room is locked from the inside, meaning the guest is there, the staff’s master key will not work. The locking mechanism won’t even turn. It will also not work if the door is unlocked. If it’s locked from the outside, meaning the guest has left, the master key will then work. If a guest is in the room with the no key and the room is locked from the outside, he has no way to get out. However, he can, of course, call the front desk and ask them to release him with the master key if he really doesn’t want to be in there.

Moving on, the account is now taken up by Mary Soptic, a housemaid, who reported to work at noon on the Wednesday, January 2. She went up to Room 1046 to clean it and found she could not get in. After knocking, she was let in by Owen, who gave her permission to go ahead and clean the room. A few minutes after she had begun, Owen put on his black overcoat, went into the bathroom to comb his hair, and then told Soptic not to lock the door because he was expecting a friend in a few minutes, after which he left. Later, when Soptic returned to room 1046 around 4 o’clock that afternoon with fresh towels, she found Owen laying on the bed with the lights out. She also saw a note on the writing desk addressed to a person named Don, instructing him to wait as the note writer would be back in fifteen minutes. In her statement, Soptic would note that Owen tried to stay hidden and kept the room unusually dark with the shades drawn and only the dim writing desk lamp on, if any lamp was on at all. She also stated that he seemed worried or scared about something.

Oddly enough, the next morning at 10:30, Soptic returned to room 1046 and used her key to get in, only to discover that Owen was still in there, sitting in the dark. Even more alarmingly, the fact that her master key turned in the lock indicated he had been locked in from the outside by someone who had his room key. While she was there on that occasion, the specter of the mysterious Don raised his head again, as Owen received a call from this person, insisting that he eat breakfast. However, Owen said he was not hungry because he already had breakfast and had to repeat the assertion, as Don evidently didn’t want to take no for an answer.

As he has done with Propst, Owen mentioned that he had stayed at the Muehlback Hotel and they had charged him a steep price for an inside room just like room 1046. He also asked if this was a residential hotel and if Soptic had charge of the entire floor. That same day, Thursday, January 3, Soptic returned to room 1046 about four o’clock in the afternoon with fresh towels, as she had took all the towels to be washed that morning. From the other side of the door, she heard two men talking, and when she knocked a loud, gruff voice asked her what she wanted. When she explained she was there with fresh towels, the man told her that they had enough towels, which, of course, would only be true if they didn’t need any towels at all.

Now, a factoid that gets repeated time and time again, as if it’s an established fact is that at eleven o’clock that evening, about six or seven hours before Owen would be brutally assaulted in his hotel room a man named Robert Lane picked up a mysterious young man, underdressed and looking like he had been in a fight. The young man mistook him for a cab driver and Mr. Lane was nice enough to give him a ride to a place where he could get a cab. Viewing the body a few days later, Lane identified the dead man as the person he had picked. However, the police investigated the incident, found the cab driver who said it was not Owen, and gave them the address where he had taken his passenger. Upon arriving there, the police interviewed a twenty year old man, and he admitted he had been in a fight that night with four “negroes”. In addition, he had left a paper trail, as he had submitted a fake hold-up report at General Hospital so he wouldn’t get in trouble with his mother for being in his fight. That being the case, it is highly likely that Owen never left his room that night.

Two of the first suspects that the police zeroed in on was another hotel guest, a 30 year old woman named Jean Owen (no relation to the victim) and her boyfriend Joe Reinert. Jean was a resident of Lee’s Summit who came into Kansas City on Wednesday, January 3to do some shopping. After she completed her purchases, she stopped by the Midland Flower shop between 3:30 and 4:00 pm to tell Mr. Reinart, who worked there, that she was not feeling well and she was going to take a room at the Hotel President for the night. He asked if he could come see her, and she told him she would call him from her hotel room and tell him what room number she was in. About six in the evening, she checked in and was given room 1048, which was the room next to 1046 where Owen was staying.

Her boyfriend, Mr. Reinart, arrived at around 9 pm and stayed until shortly after 11 pm. He noted, as he left, that there was a party going on at the east end of the hall. He judged from the sound of their voices that there were men and women present and they probably numbered a half dozen or close to it. He then went to the drugstore in the Hotel building for a cup of coffee and after that went home.

Jean Owen, meanwhile, had went to bed. However, sleep did not come easy to her as there was a lot of noise that sounded like it was on the same floor as she was and consisted largely of what she described as men and women talking loudly and cursing. The police files don’t contain anything specifically on whether these two people were cleared of the crime. However, both individuals gave a good accounting of where they were and what they were doing before, during, and after the assault on Owen. The only thing I can say is a lot of the information they gave would have been very easy to corroborate, which the police may have done.

And there is, in fact, partial corroboration for some of the their claims by three of the Hotel staff. For instance, at 12:20 am on Friday, January 4, the Night clerk, Harry Casebier delivered ice to room 1055 where a party, consisting of eight to ten people, both men and women, was going on. This was most likely the same party that Joe Reinert heard, as room 1055 was on the east side of the hall, and it may also be the source of the loud noises Jean Owen heard when she was trying to sleep. After viewing the body at the morgue, Casebier stated that the dead man was not one of the guests he saw at the party. Casebier returned to the tenth floor around 5:30 am to deliver papers and heard men and women talking, but he could not say what room the voices were issuing from.

The next eyewitness to the events that night is the elevator operator named Charles Blocher. He relates that sometime between 12 and 3 am, he took a woman who frequents the hotel with various men to the 10th floor because she was asking for room 1026. He described her as a “commercial woman”, which seems to be a polite euphemism for a prostitute. Five minutes after he dropped her off, she signaled him to return because whatever person she was looking for, who was usually very dependable, was not in room 1026, and she wondered if it could be 1024, since there was a light in there. Forty minutes later, he received another signal to go to the 10th floor and found this same woman waiting for him. She then rode down the elevator with him and left the hotel. 

An hour later she returned with a man and Blocher took both of them to the ninth floor. At about 4:15 am, he received a signal to go to the ninth floor, and this same woman came down the elevator with him and left the hotel. Another night clerk, James Hadden, saw this woman step off the elevator around that time. He stated that he did not know where she lived, but could easily find out, as she hangs around the corner of 12th and Baltimore most of time. If the police took him up on his offer, they either never generated a report of it, or it has been lost, as there’s nothing in the file to indicate they did.

Fifteen minutes after the woman departed, the man she accompanied also rode down on the elevator and left the hotel, saying he couldn’t sleep. Blocher gave a physical description of the man and woman. Both of them were about five foot six in height. The man was slender and was wearing a brown overcoat, brown shoes, and a brown hat. The woman had black hair, and the only thing Blocher could remember about her attire was that she was wearing a black coat made of Hudson seal or imitation Hudson seal, with a collar that stood up and had a strip of fur on the collar.

The Night clerk James Hadden related that there was also a party going on in room 1005, which would be at the west end of the hall, opposite the direction of where the other party was, which seemed to consist of only two people, a woman who was the registered guest and who comes to the hotel quite often and her guest, a lady friend. Hadden states he saw them come down on the elevator around 4:30 am. The elevator operator, Charles Blocher, corroborates this, as he recalled bringing two middle-aged ladies down between 4 and 5 am, He stated that he believed they were Jewish because one of them had a black overnight bag as luggage.

And finally to round out the seemingly hopping tenth floor made up of a bunch of insomniacs with the unfortunate Jean Owen being the only exclusion, Blocher relates that he brought another man down on the elevator between 5 and 6 am. This man was carrying a Gladstone bag and a briefcase. And that’s an important point because many overviews of this crime attribute the Gladstone bag to the man accompanied by the “commercial woman” when it really belonged to a lone man who left the hotel about an hour or so after the other man did. Blocher says he believes the lone man was a registered guest, meaning the police possibly could have tracked him down. If they did or even attempted to, there’s no evidence in the file for that.

At 6:55 am on January 4, 1935, the Night telephone operator, Leona Oeklaus noticed that the buzzer and light came on from room 1046, which is a signal that a guest needs telephone service. However, when she plugged in, she couldn’t get a response from the room. Harry Casebier was then sent up to tell the guest to place the receiver back on the hook. He went up, knocked three times on the door, and got no answer. At 7 am, when the light still had not turned off, Leona sent Propst to 1046 with same message. After knocking loudly twice, he heard a deep voice from within say: “Come in”. The door, however, was locked. After knocking again, the same voice said: “Turn on the lights”. The bellboy kept on knocking, but when he couldn’t get the guest to come to the door, he yelled through the door for him to put the phone receiver back on the hook. He then left, returned to the lobby, and reported that he believed the man was drunk.

Despite the efforts of Casebier and Propst, Della Ferguson, who relieved Leona at the switchboard found the phone was still off the hook at 8:30. This time she sent bellboy Harry Pike up with master key, and he was surprised to find his key worked and the lock turned easily, indicating the guest had been locked in his room again by someone who had absconded with his key. Pike went in and found the man sprawled on the bed, stark naked. Believing the man was drunk, Pike simply righted the telephone stand, which had fallen over, placed the telephone back on it, and hung up the receiver. He did see a dark spot on the sheet. However, as he did not turn on the lights he thought it was a shadow.

Five minutes later, Ferguson saw the light was on again.  She then used a ringing apparatus, which makes a loud noise in the room to get a guest’s attention, but that had no effect. At 10:30 am, telephone operator Betty Cole noticed that the light was still on and sent Propst up with the pass key. Propst went in to find the guest two feet from the door on his knees and elbows, holding his head in his hands, and Propst could see blood on him. This prompted him to turn on the light, and after he replaced the receiver, he could see blood on the walls and the bed. This frightened him and he immediately left to get Mr. Weaver, who called Dr. Flanders.

To be continued (I hope).",The Journey of Roland T. Owen
600,Environmental_War_62,[],1636653407,"Hi, this is my first post. This is a local mystery for me that I heard about recently and thought I'd share it here. The case seems to have received a lot of media attention when it first happened in the 80's , unfortunately all news articles about it seem to only exist in physical form so there is little information about it online apart from a very short documentary from 2010, which from here I collected most of the information. All of this took place in the city of Quito, Ecuador's capital. I apologize for any errors, english is not my first language. 

**The victim**

So, Ivan Germanico Egas was an ecuadorean student born in 1959, he was studying to become an architect at Universidad Central at the time he was murdered. He had at least two siblings, one brother and a sister, who would be the one to identify his body. His family described him as ''very calm and respectful.'' The night of september 10, 1982 (the night of the murder) he went out in his car to meet and hang out with friends and that is the last time his family saw him alive. I couldn't find more information as to where did the group went or Ivan's movements that night.  

**The crime**

In the early hours of the morning of september 11, Floresmilo Bolaños, the gatekeeper of the lion's cage located in the military school Eloy Alfaro (from what I have been told the building was both a school and a zoo, yes I know that's weird) went to check the animals, there were four in total, an adult male, an adult female and their two cubs. Floresmilo noticed a shoe sticking out from beneath the male lion and soon realized the animal was feeding on a dead body. Police was called and an autopsy was soon carried out. This first autopsy concluded the victim had been intoxicated and walked inside the lion's cage, the death was ruled a suicide. However Ivan's family strongly disagreed with this, claiming Ivan had no suicidal tendencies. On top of that, Ivan's car was later found at a significant distance from the military school, it showed bumps as if it had collided with something. A second autopsy was performed the following month at the family's insistence, this time the coroner found that, on top of being partially eaten, the body showed evidence of blunt force trauma as well as genital mutilation and the death was reclassified as homicide. Floresmilo was then arrested in connection to the case despite the lack of evidence against him, he would spent the next six years in prison without being convicted of any crime. 

Two years later, in 1984, police announced lieutenant Pedro Vallejo, which had been named as the ''intellectual author'' of the crime, meaning he supposedly ordered Ivan's murder but didn't commit the murder himself. The apparent motive was jealousy, Ivan and Pedro's wife, Lila, were allegedly having an affair and that is supposedly what triggered the murder. An article I found mentions Lila and  someone named Nelson O. were also named as supposed perpetrators of the crime, the article doesn't go into much detail about who Nelson O. was, how was he connected to Lila and Pedro or what role did he allegedly played. Nevertheless, all three aforementioned people were declared not guilty of the crime. Floresmilo eventually got out of prison and in 2010 he would receive a public apology from the ecuadorean government, admitting his humans rights had been violated. Ivan's family hired a private investigator to look into the case but it seems nothing came off from it. Ten years later, in 1992, the case prescribed and was archived. No one was ever convicted for Ivan's murder. 

**Public opinion**

The public opinion seems to be that whoever wanted Ivan dead was someone with a lot of power and there was definitely an attempt to cover it up, this would explain why the first coroner somehow ''missed'' all the evidence of foul play in the first autopsy. I haven't been able to find what kind of evidence did police gather against Pedro and his wife, but the sexual mutilation does add some credibility to the motive the prosecution gave. It is also believed the murderer must have had some ties to the military school, since the building has guards watching, so it is still unclear how on earth this person (or people) managed to sneak Ivan's body inside the lion's cage in the first place.

India with its history and culture of mysticism and faith has always been home to loads of self-proclaimed godmen. And it has not been uncommon for them to run afoul of the law. There have been many who have been convicted of murder, rape and all sorts of other crimes.


Swami Nithyananda was also one of them. Born in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, his ashram began to spread it’s influence in regions of India like Kerala,Tamil Nadu and even far off in United States. Apart from being linked to sex scandals he was also accused of rape and instead of cooperating with the police and Court orders he instead chose to flee India in October of 2019.


Now people fleeing India to escape from being indicted or jailed has always been an all too common occurrence, with people like Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi being some of the high profile ones.But even after their escape, people generally have an idea of where they reside mostly in countries like UK or the Caribbean


Swami Nithyananda chose a different approach by forming his own country called Kailaasa after fleeing India in late 2019.The country apparently has its own currency and reserve bank and claims to issue its own passports. It also was one of the first “country” to ban inward travel due to the threat of Covid-19.
Kailaasa has been reported to be located near Trinidad &amp; Tobago or Ecuador or an island in South America, which the Ecuadorian embassy has denied.Chartered flights run from Australia for anyone who wishes to visit.Now obviously you can’t form your own country so where the hell is he? India has never really been strong In pursuing extradition cases as plenty of wanted guys in India live plush lives abroad so why the need for secrecy.Also most of the reporting in Indian media have been through Swami Nithyananda’s website or press reports. Surely if somebody started a cult in your neighbourhood you would notice, especially with people of a different race. Where is the local reporting.

602,texas-is-the-reason,[],1636606652,"This is a pretty infamous case from Arkansas that was opened in 1995, so to catch you up to speed, here’s a quick recap from Wikipedia:

“On June 9, 1995, Morgan Nick and her mother, Colleen Nick, went to a Little League baseball game in the town of Alma, Arkansas. At around 10:30 p.m., Morgan asked her mother if she could catch fireflies with her friends. At first, her mother was uncertain, but eventually let her go. She was last seen at 10:45 p.m. by her friends, emptying sand out of her shoes alone near her mother's car while her group of friends emptied their shoes a few dozen feet away. Morgan's friends reported seeing a ""creepy"" man talking to Morgan as she was putting her shoes back on.

When the game ended shortly thereafter, Morgan's friends returned without her. They told Colleen that Morgan was at her car, but when Colleen returned to the car, Morgan was not there. She has not been seen or heard from since.”

Since then, her mother Colleen started the Morgan Nick Foundation to help parents cope with missing children. Very specific leads were pursued over the years, but nothing came to fruition for neither the family nor investigators. 

Now, the FBI have officially released the name of a person of interest. His name is Bill Lincks. Unfortunately (for detectives), Lincks died in prison in 2000. So, they are asking the public if they have any additional information on this man. He served in the army and spent time in Dallas, but not much is known about him.

604,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,[],1636605978," 

December 5th 1945 around 2:10 pm. Five TBM Avenger aircraft took off to do a routine drill/exercise around Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their drill required them to follow a triangular flight path and practise bombing runs. They would turn north head towards Grand Bahama Island, before changing course a third time and flying southwest back to base. Nearly all planes carried three pilots ( except for one that carried two) and most of them had an average of about 300 hours on air. Their leader was Lieutenant Charles C. Taylor, an experienced pilot and veteran of several combat missions in the Second World War Pacific Theater. 

At first, Flight 19’s hop proceeded just as smoothly as the previous 18 that day. Taylor and his pilots buzzed over Hens and Chickens Shoals around 2:30 p.m. and dropped their practice bombs without incident. But shortly after the patrol turned north for the second leg of its journey, something very strange happened. For reasons that are still unclear, Taylor became convinced that his Avenger’s compass was malfunctioning and that his planes had been flying in the wrong direction. The troubles only mounted after a front blew in and brought rain, gusting winds and heavy cloud cover. Flight 19 became hopelessly disoriented. “I don’t know where we are,” one of the pilots said over the radio. “We must have got lost after that last turn.”

Lieutenant Robert F. Cox, another Navy flight instructor who was flying near the Florida coast, was the first to overhear the patrol’s radio communications. He immediately informed the Air Station of the situation and then contacted the Avengers to ask if they needed assistance. “Both my compasses are out and I’m trying to find Ft. Lauderdale, Florida,” Taylor said, his voice sounding anxious. “I’m over land, but it’s broken. I’m sure I’m in the Keys, but I don’t know how far down.”

Taylor’s claim didn’t seem to make sense. He’d made his scheduled pass over Hens and Chicken Shoals in the Bahamas less than an hour earlier, but he now believed his planes had somehow drifted hundreds of miles off course and ended up in the Florida Keys. The 27-year-old had just transferred to Fort Lauderdale from Miami, and many have since speculated that he may have confused some of the islands of the Bahamas for the Keys. Under normal circumstances, pilots lost in the Atlantic were supposed to point their planes toward the setting sun and fly west toward the mainland, but Taylor had become convinced that he might be over the Gulf of Mexico. Hoping to locate the Florida peninsula, he made a fateful decision to steer Flight 19 northeast—a course that would only take them even farther out to sea. Some of his pilots seemed to have recognized that he was making a mistake. “Dammit,” one man griped over the radio. “If we would just fly west, we would get home.”

Taylor was eventually persuaded to turn around and head west, but shortly after 6 p.m., he seems to have cancelled the order and once again changed direction. “We didn’t go far enough east,” he said, still worried that he might be in the Gulf. “We may as well just turn around and go east again.” His pilots probably argued against the decision—some investigators even believe that one plane broke off and flew in a different direction—but most followed their commander’s lead. Flight 19’s radio transmissions soon became increasingly faint as it meandered out to sea. When fuel began to run low, Taylor was heard prepping his men for a potential crash landing in the ocean. “All planes close up tight,” he said. “We’ll have to ditch unless landfall…when the first plane drops below ten gallons, we all go down together.” A few minutes later, the Avengers’ last radio communications were replaced by an eerie buzz of static.

The Navy immediately scrambled search planes to hunt for the missing patrol. Around 7:30 p.m., a pair of PBM Mariner flying boats took off from an air station north of Ft. Lauderdale. Just 20 minutes later, however, one of them seemed to follow Flight 19’s lead by suddenly vanishing off radar. The remains of the Mariner and its 13 crewmen were never recovered, but it’s commonly believed that the seaplane exploded shortly after takeoff. Flying boats were notoriously accident-prone, and were even nicknamed “flying gas tanks” for their propensity for catching fire. Suspicions that the seaplane may have gone up in flames were all but confirmed by a passing merchant ship, which spotted a fireball and found evidence of an oil slick in the ocean.

At first light the next day, the Navy dispatched more than 300 boats and aircraft to look for Flight 19 and the missing Mariner. The search party spent five days combing through more than 300,000 square miles of territory, to no avail. “They just vanished,” Navy Lieutenant David White later recalled. “We had hundreds of planes out looking, and we searched over land and water for days, and nobody ever found the bodies or any debris.” A Navy board of investigation was also left scratching its head. While it argued that Taylor might have confused the Bahamas for the Florida Keys after his compasses malfunctioned, it could find no clear explanation for why Flight 19 had become so disoriented. Its members eventually attributed the loss to “causes or reasons unknown.”

The strange events of December 5, 1945 have since become fodder for all manner of wild theories and speculation. In the 1960s and 70s, pulp magazines and writers such as Vincent Gaddis and Charles Berlitz helped popularize the idea that Flight 19 had been gobbled up by the “Bermuda Triangle,” a section of the Atlantic supposedly known for its high volume of freak disappearances and mechanical failures. Other books and fictional portrayals have suggested that magnetic anomalies, parallel dimensions and alien abductions might have all played a role in the tragedy. In 1977, the film “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” famously depicted Flight 19 as having been whisked away by flying saucers and later deposited in the deserts of Mexico.

Even if the “Lost Patrol” didn’t fall victim to the supernatural, there’s no denying that its disappearance was accompanied by many oddities and unanswered questions. Perhaps the strangest of all concerns Lieutenant Taylor. Witnesses later claimed that he arrived to Flight 19’s pre-exercise briefing several minutes late and requested to be excused from leading the mission. “I just don’t want to take this one out,” he supposedly said. Just why Taylor tried to get out of flying remains a mystery, but it has led many to suggest that he may have not been fit for duty. Also unexplained is why none of the members of Flight 19 made use of the rescue radio frequency or their planes’ ZBX receivers, which could have helped lead them toward Navy radio towers on land. The pilots were told to switch the devices on, but they either didn’t hear the message or didn’t acknowledge it.

What really happened to Flight 19? The most likely scenario is that the planes eventually ran out of gas and ditched in the ocean somewhere off the coast of Florida, leaving any survivors at the mercy of rough seas and deep water. In 1991, a group of treasure hunters seemed to have finally solved the puzzle when they stumbled upon the watery graves of five World War II-era Avengers near Fort Lauderdale. Unfortunately, it was later found that the hulks belonged to a different group of Navy planes whose serial numbers didn’t match those of the fabled “Lost Patrol.” Many believe the wrecks of Flight 19 and its doomed rescue plane may still lurk somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, but while the search continues to this day, no definitive signs of the six aircraft or their 27 crewmen have ever been found.

605,Afraid-Emotion-5102,[],1636586911,"The unsolved murder of Inga Maria Hauser is a bit of a puzzler. 

If you believe the news reports over the last few years,  you'd think that police are ever so close to catching her killer(s). 

To give a brief synopsis of this case, Inga was 18, and had travelled from Germany, via train, got a boat from The Netherlands to the UK, then travelled through England and Scotland using trains as well. 

She had gone as far as Inverness, then travelled back down again to Stranraer - at the time the boats used to Dock here, and she got the boat to Larne. 

People remember seeing her on the boat, but when it docked into Larne, it seemed that she had vanished. 

Going by information out there, it seems her plan had been to get the train from Larne to Belfast, and eventually onwards to Dublin, where she could get a boat across the Irish Sea  to Holyhead, as she was planning on meeting a friend. 

However, she was missing for a few weeks, before her partially clothed body was found in Ballypatrick forest in North Antrim, by a local farmer. 

She had been sexually assaulted, had her neck broke, her personal belongings were scattered nearby, and it seemed that no real effort had been made to conceal her body. 

There were reconstructions of her last movements, and these were based on the premise that she had been moving around North Antrim in the weeks leading up to the discovery of her body. 

In recent years, this has changed.  It is officially believed that the area where she was found acted like a ""fridge""  as there was little to no decomposition of her body, and she I'd now believed to have been murdered in the few hours after she got off the boat in Larne. 

Police have stated on numerous occasions that they have a DNA profile from the scene of the crime. 

People have been questioned over her murder, and a file has been sent to the public prosecution service, to see if it could proceed to trial, but this has been ruled out. 

For further reading on this case, check out the blog by Keeley Moss: 

https://thekeeleychronicles.wordpress.com/ 

This is the definitive resource about this case, a serious amount of information here, Keeley has went to extraordinary lengths to compile it. 

As for my own views, I'm perplexed by it all.  There is much made of the DNA sample from the crime scene  - I know for a fact that many men in the local North Antrim area volunteered their DNA samples. 

The police state that the suspect is local, but is he? If they know who he is, and going by one news article, they have narrowed it down to a specific familial DNA profile, why haven't they been able to hone in on them? 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7878462.stm 

The news reports over the past few years are the usual ""people have been brought in for questioning"", ""we are getting close"", but it feels they are nowhere near getting anything to court. 

I found an article posted by Madden and Finucane solicitors, who were representing the male suspect, think they lifted it from Belfast Telegraph. Have linked it below.  

https://madden-finucane.com/2020/07/08/inga-maria-hauser-no-prosecution-of-suspects-in-murder-probe/ 

It seems that the DNA doesn't match this particular suspect. 

Does the suspect (person with the DNA profile at scene of crime) even live here anymore? 

As has been stated elsewhere, is there some informer, from the days of the troubles, preventing justice from being served? 

The narrative now, that she was dead in a few hours, based on re evaluating evidence, how watertight is that? Is there the possibility that she was alive, and anything after that is being discounted? Much light was made that there were no entries in her diary after she got off the boat, could she have been held captive somewhere, killed afterwards? 

I did come an webpage posting an alternative theory - pretty sectarian, 
https://lifeasawitness.weebly.com/ - I asked someone about this, they confirmed this theory was checked out and swiftly dismissed. 

I just don't know, hopefully the family will get some justice or closure, but I don't know how.

606,moondog151,[],1636582742,"Cyphus Yeawonyee was a 17 year old boy who lived in in a small town called Ganta, 5 hours away from the Liberian capital of Monrovia. Cyphus worked as a courier and would rent a motorcycle from a neighborhood entrepreneur. He would then use this motorcycle to transport people to their destination so he could make some money for his family and once he was done he would return the rented motorcycle before heading home.

However on the evening of September 22, 2015 that did not happen. Around the same time a 17 year old boy from the neighborhood named Jacob Vambo had approached Cyphus's home and was met by one of his brothers. Jacob asked one of the brothers where Cyphus is and the brother responded confused and said “You carried my brother today, you now come to ask me about him?” Cephus seemed uneasy by this question and quickly left raising the suspicions of Cyphus's father James Zbeghn.

The following morning on September 23, 2015 Cyphus had yet to return and his father went to the police station to report his son missing but once he arrived he found that Jacob was at the police station as well to report the theft of a package of palm oil. James pulled an officer aside and told him that his son was missing and that he suspected Jacob of being responsible in someway.

Jacob denied any involvement when questioned but James, A police officer and the owner of the motorcycle that Cyphus rented decided to search Jacob's yard and found and found the motorcycle hidden under a tarp. It was missing the colorful distinguishing fiberglass coverings that protect the engine which would've made identifying the motorcycle difficult but the owner of the bike was able to tell that it was his bike.

Jacob was arrested and the police interrogated him for three days straight which was enough to break him and cause him to confess. He never told the police that he killed him but he did state that Cyphus was dead and that his body was at a sugar cane farm owned by his family 30 minutes outside of Ganta.

An officer was sent to the scene and found the body and Jacob was charged with his murder. The official report and motive for the murder was ""Cephus and Jacob had set out to steal a goat from a nearby town, but that Jacob decided to kill Cephus and take his motorcycle instead."" There were several rumors that the body was mutilated and bore all the signs of a ritual killing but this theory was refuted by the police with commander Adolphus Zuah stating that the body was too decomposed to tell if any organs were removed even though it was only three days after Cyphus went missing.

Jacob would be given an unusually quick trial for Liberia's notoriously slow justice system with his trial taking place only 5 months after his arrest as opposed to years like many other cases. At the trial the autopsy report for Cyphus was read aloud and it strongly conflicted with the police's version of events and supported the numerous rumors circulating around the town as when the coroner Jerry Tuah was told of the police's theory during the trial simply shook his head and said ""It isn't true"" he noted during his examination that major internal organs were missing and that his his eyes, intestines, nose and ears were all removed. Cyphus's body also had several other wounds such as long gashes on his torso, a gaping hole above his breast bone and patches of skin were removed from his skull.

This bore all the signs of a ritual killing with murders of this nature being a problem across the African continent with people committing acts such as this one believing that the removal of organs and the victim's suffering will bring them wealth, power and great fortune however a large number of ritual killers carry these crimes out on the behalf of others. It is not unheard of for politicians in African nations to pay someone to commit ritual murders in hopes of advancing their political careers and and as the 1965 - 1977 Maryland ritual killings how Liberia is no different in this regard

When police commander Adolphus Zuah was asked about ritual killings he stated that none had ever happened in the town of Ganta despite all the injuries inflicted on Cyphus. He simply shook his head and said ""I haven't seen it""

Many people upon hearing this were unable to believe that a 17 year old boy was capable of committing such an act or that he would even be able to with his ability to overpower someone long enough to commit a deed like this being called into question. And Jacob denied being the killer and that he instead simply lured Cyphus to the sugar cane field. He stated that a powerful, high-ranking local government official was the true murderer and that he had offered to pay Jacob enough money to attend university telling Jacob “I need some parts from a human and I would like you to find someone for me,” The name of this alleged official was Sam Kehleay the county coordinator for the Ministry of Agriculture.

Despite the shoddy police investigation and lack of evidence proving that he had actually committed the murder Jacob Vambo was tried as an adult and near the end of February, 2016 he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment he cried as he was taken away professing his innocence.

Jacob while in prison stuck to his story accusing the police of beating and torturing him during interrogation. And he stated that he had witnesses proving that he had met and knew Sam Kehleay but that the police simply ignored him. Jacob has stated that he deserves punishment for his role in the crime but that Sam Kehleay shouldn't escape justice as well.

There are a few inconsistencies however as the first time Jacob accused his brothers of being accomplices in luring Cyphus away and they were all arrested and tried alongside Jacob but they were acquitted and claimed that a family fued is the only reason he accused them.

Despite this however many still think there may be some truth to Jacob's story due to the behavior of the police and courts. Although Jacob's brothers were arrested just on his word alone there is no evidence that any action was taken against Sam Kehleay and that he wasn't looked into even slightly or questioned a single time despite witnesses being named that could vouch for the two knowing each other.

There's also the fact that due to Jacob's size and body type it would've been difficult if not impossible for him to inflict the injuries seen on Cyphus's body all on his own. The police also claimed that the witnesses named moved away and didn't work at a club that Jacob claimed to have met Sam Kehleay at. However the two witnesses were easily located by other residents and journalist both living within walking distance of the club. Although the two named can't remember seeing Jacob and Sam Kehleay together a security guard recalls Jacob buying a round of drinks for all the staff despite his meager salary. They all stated that the police never interviewed them and admit that their memories might be cloudy due to how much time passed since the case. Another reason why people believe Jacob's story is that over the years he told the exact same story down to the tiniest of details such as the types of vehicles that passed them on the road.

Also the same year while Jacob was in prison another murder had occurred and although it was later proven to not be a ritual killing many people in Ganta rioted due to their frustrations at the police's inability to protect its citizens. Eventually armed police and UN Peacekeeping forces had to be deployed to Ganta due to the unrest.

Regardless of weather Jacob is solely responsible and if Sam Kehleay is innocent many Liberians feel that the police's actions during this trial are at best incompetence and a failure to perform their duties and properly question named suspects and at worst corruption and covering for those in power.

Cyphus's father James Zbeghn had this to say ""There is no justice in Liberia, This is the reason why mob violence happens. They can kill my son, but God’s judgment is before them""

In 2018 the county attorney for Nimba County stated that he was considering reopening but there has been no updates since then.

He was kidnapped in front of his two siblings William Mattson (16) Muriel Mattson (14) and Muriel's friend Virginia Chatfield (14). A ransom note was left demanding $28,000 USD (equivalent to $557,157.70 today). Despite attempts from his father to contact the kidnappers and pay the ransom, he was unable to. On January 11th, 1937, a hunter finds Charles' battered body in a Snohomish County field. The autopsy revealed that Charles was stabbed in the back and bludgeoned over the head to death. Authorities thought that the suspect must be a pervert and also released a description that described the man as unshaven, swarthy man about 35 to 40 years old, five feet seven inches tall, 145 pounds, with dark hair, brown eyes, and a foreign accent, wearing a dark blue jacket, dark work trousers, and a brown and white checkered cap, This case had a huge impact in American Society and President Franklin Roosevelt issued the statement:

"" The murder of the little Mattson boy has shocked the Nation. Every means at our command must be enlisted to capture and punish the perpetrator of this ghastly crime. Attorney General \[Homer Stille\] Cummings \[1870-1956\] informs me that he has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the criminal and that the special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice are engaged in a search which will be pursued relentlessly and will not be terminated until the murderer is caught.  I bespeak for the agents of the Department of Justice the continued and wholehearted cooperation of the local police and all other law enforcement agents in this necessary work. A crime of this kind is renewed evidence of the need of sustained effort in dealing with the criminal menace.""

Despite this, the killer was never found and it seems that the case was forgotten to time. I'm curious if anyone has any ideas on what happened or who the kidnapper was.

608,Blondieleigh,[],1636575170,"Doing my best here as there's not much information. Unfortunately it seems that no one ever reported the girls missing.

In September 2021, an agent with child services arrived at the home of Marie Snyder, following reports from a medical practitioner that her 7-year-old son had speech problems, was not enrolled in school and was not toilet trained. While there, she noted that Marie's daughters, Nicole and Jasmine, who would have been 11 and 8, were not present. Marie claimed the girls were living with a friend, who was home schooling them, but would not provide any details as to who this friend was. She later claimed the same friend had taken them out of state, but once again refused to provide details, claiming she didn't know where they were. Her partner, Echo Butler, confirmed the story. The following day, Echo's father contacted authorities to tell them the couple had packed their bags and left.

Authorities contacted the girls father, who stated he had not seen his children since 2015 due to custody and protection from abuse orders.

Police surveyed the neighbourhood and established that no one had seen the girls. Echo's mother, Michelle, also confirmed that she had not seen the girls ""for at least six years"", and had been told they were out of state.

In early November, Marie was arrested at work, and charged with endangering the welfare of children and obstruction in child abuse cases. Her son was placed in foster care. The property where they were living became the subject of searches, and on the 6th and 7th of November, the remains of two children, now identified as the girls, were found in shallow graves on the property. Authorities believe that Nicole was buried in 2016, and her sister, Jasmine, was buried in 2017.

On November 8th, Butler admitted that she was aware of the girls deaths, and knew the truth regarding their circumstances.

At this point, neither woman has been charged in the deaths of the girls, but the case is being investigated as a homicide.

The human bone fragments were found in September at a construction site on Loon Mountain. That’s about 25 miles east of where Murray crashed her car in North Haverhill in 2004, the last place the nursing student was ever seen.

Police say based on radiocarbon dating of the bones, the person likely died between 1774 and 1942. The bones do not appear to have been recently moved.

Paula claims she was involved in a plane crash during her tour that left her partially paralyzed. She took years out to recover from her injuries. The problem is that no records of this crash into an Iowa cornfield exist at the time she alleges. Furthermore, no media attention of the story at the time.

A while ago I was reading the People Who Disappeared Mysteriously Wikipedia article and I ran into the case of Rui Pedro Teixeira Mendonça and it haunted me forever. The gist of it is that he was groomed by an older “friend” of his and subsequently sold into trafficking. He was one of the few children who were identified during the raid on The Wonderland Club, a CP website. Despite them recognizing him in the videos, and a likely sighting of him at Disneyland Paris, he is presumed to be dead now. I’m not the best at describing these, so I’ll link a few websites that go over the case at the end of this post if you want to read more.

What cases do you guys know about where it is either confirmed or presumed that the victim was alive for a notable amount of time after they were last seen?

The FBI is currently looking for information regarding a person of interest in the Morgan Nick case. 

Billy Jack Lincks, who died in prison in 2000, is currently a person of interest in the girl's disappearance. This is the first publicly named person of interest in the case. 

According to the FBI, Lincks was a Crawford County resident. Two months before Morgan's disappearance, he attempted to abduct a young girl in Van Buren near the Wofford baseball field where Morgan was last seen. 

Lincks was given a polygraph test after his arrest for attempted abduction. The FBI did not administer this test, so the details are unknown. 

""I imagine that this test was in regards to the Morgan Nick case,"" Connor Hagan, FBI public affairs officer said. 

When Morgan was abducted in 1995, she was playing with her friends at a baseball game in Alma.

The FBI is currently seeking information regarding Billy Jack Lincks. Lincks has become a person of interest in the disappearance of Morgan Nick. 

Her friends noted that they saw Morgan speaking to a man in a red truck. She was last seen emptying sand from her shoes by her mother’s vehicle, and when her mother attempted to go see Morgan, she was gone, and so was the red truck.

Previous attempts to find Morgan have failed, various leads were to homes in Spiro in nearby Oklahoma and Booneville in Logan County as a possible spot where Morgan might be. In 2002, police conducted a dig on a private piece of land where it was suspected she was buried.

The search was eventually called off after finding no evidence. In 2010, a home in Spiro was searched for possible DNA evidence that Morgan had been there. Police returned to the home in 2017 after receiving another tip, but again the search was called off.

""Lincks has been on our radar,"" Hagan said. ""We were very hesitant about putting it out that he was a person of interest until the evidence we gathered pointed strongly towards him. We've been looking at this for a long time and we have evidence that is pushing us that way.""

The FBI is requesting that anyone who has any information about Lincks contact them at 1-800-CALL-FBI","FBI has named, for the first time, a person of interest in the Morgan Nick case"
615,send_me_potatoes,[],1636493361,"The Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office (FBCSO) is reopening the cold case of Julie Esther Hawkins. This announcement comes after Season of Justice, a nonprofit organization, awarded the FBCSO a $10,100 grant to test DNA, which was likely recovered from the scene.

Julie was last seen by her mother at approximately noon on Thursday, December 6th, who dropped her daughter off at a Houston intersection to do some shopping. The Hawkins family lived near Rice University and the Texas Medical Center, which was and is considered a nice, safe area of Houston.

Julie's body was recovered the next day in a remote area of Fort Bend County along FM 1464, which is due west of Houston. At this time the area was probably mostly rural, which would likely point to the perpetrator having a car. Houston was (and still is) fairly spread out. While public transportation is available, it is quite limited.

What we definitely know follows: the coroner determined that Julie had died by ligature strangulation, and by the time bird hunters had found body the body, she had been dead for 12-14 hours. I've found no obituary for Julie Hawkins, and it seems her parents divorced just a few years later.

While Julie likely lived a happy, sheltered life, Houston as a whole was not the safest city. To put thing in perspective, this was the time that Dean Corll, the Candy Man, was hunting and killing teenage boys in the Heights. Police had limited resources for investigating crimes, and the fact that the victim in this case went missing in one jurisdiction and was found in another likely did not help the investigation.

As an aside, I'm originally from this area. Until the early 2000s, Fort Bend County was still semi-rural, and Houston was not nearly as sprawling as it is today. What we now call ""neighborhoods"" in Houston were semi-autonomous villages within Houston city limits; this is what partially allowed Dean Corll, who operated in the Heights, to kill as long he did despite numerous signs of his dangerous nature.

It is with this grant I hope Julie Hawkins, who outlived her parents, step-father, and grandparents, gets the closure she deserves. I also hope the closing of this case leads to the closure of other similar cases in the Houston area so their families can get the resolution they deserve.

**A recap**:

Diane J. Olkwitz was a 19 year old secretary who lived in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. In November of 1966 she was found brutally murdered at her workplace, Kenworth Manufacturing Co., a metal stamping plant of about 25 employees, where she had worked for the last eighteen months as a secretary.

The other employees at Kenworth worked until 3:30pm, but Diane, the only secretary, normally worked until 4:30pm to answer calls or accept any late deliveries. During this hour, Diane would be alone at the plant. After work, her usual routine was to drive to her best friend's workplace, which was close by, to pick her up, and the two young women would ride home together. Diane's best friend, who was also named Diane (Zimmer) had recently married, just two months earlier, and Diane had been the maid of honor at Zimmer's wedding.  Diane herself was engaged; her fiance, Donald Hierlmeier, was in the Army and was currently at basic training in Fort Hood,TX.

On this particular day, November 3, 1966, Diane started work as normal at 8 am, but when 4:30 pm rolled around, Zimmer waited for her best friend to pick her up, as usual, but Diane didn't show and calls to her work number went unanswered. Concerned, Zimmer got a ride from her employer's wife, and the two women went to Kenworth to check up on Diane. It was about 5 pm at this time. Diane's car was in the parking lot but the doors to the building were locked and there was no sign of anyone, even though the two women could see through a window that Diane's purse was on her desk and her coat was nearby. Zimmer and the other woman were unsure of what to do, so they decided to walk next door to another business, where Diane's brother, Dennis, worked. The three of them returned to Kenworth around 5:20pm, just as a plant supervisor arrived to do some after-hours work.

After the supervisor unlocked the shipping door and they went in, the three were confronted with a gruesome sight about 20 feet away from the door; Diane was lying face down in a pool of blood, dead. The county coroner determined that Diane had been stabbed 106 times with a small knife. Most of the stab wounds were on her head, neck and chest, with approximately 35 of them in rows up and down her back. Defensive wounds were evident on her arms and the back of her hands, and her nose was broken.

Although her dress was pulled up between her legs, and partly off her shoulders, ( probably from being dragged or pulled, I imagine the killer grabbed her by the dress at the shoulders and waist and was pulling her towards him as she was trying to escape, perhaps as she was on the floor, trying to crawl away) she was not sexually assaulted, though evidently there was a great deal of other ""evidence"" at the crime scene that was sent to the FBI for analysis, fingerprints being mentioned specifically. In the 1990s, there was DNA testing done of some of the evidence collected, though I never saw anything which said specifically what they had. It's probable that there was blood evidence from the killer if he had cut himself during the violent stabbing or perhaps hair or skin cells on her clothing or around her body.

Interviews and questioning of Diane's friends and acquaintances gave them few leads. There were initially six suspects, but apparently all six suspects were eventually ruled out and had alibis. Diane's family long suspected the son of her employer was the culprit, as he had been interested in Diane romantically and had frequently asked her to go out with him, but she had no interest in him and was somewhat frightened of his persistent, unwanted advances. He had an alibi, but Diane's loved ones still felt strongly he was the killer and hoped, as years went by and the use of DNA in forensics came into the forefront, that they could get answers, but the employer's son had died in 1991 and was cremated, with the cremains location unknown. His parents, who are now also deceased, were not cremated, and eventually DNA was obtained from the parents, after exhuming their bodies. The DNA obtained was not a match and proved that the son was not the killer, leaving the case cold again.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

55 years have now passed since Diane Olkwitz was murdered. Diane's devastated fiance, Donald, tragically was KIA in South Vietnam a little over a year later, in February 1968. Diane's mother, Irene, died in 1973, her father, Robert, in 1976.  Two other siblings have since passed as well. Diane Zimmer, Diane's best friend, was fearful for years afterwards, thinking the killer might come after her as well.

Without any DNA hits on CODIS after all these years, I think this case would be one that would really benefit from the newest trend of forensic genealogy to find the killer and I hope the Menomonee Falls Police Department look into that for this case.

The violence of Diane's murder, and the knowledge that she would be alone and when, seems to indicate that it was someone she knew,  and that it someone who was very angry with her, which usually means a personal connection of some kind, which is what the police have been thinking all this time.

I'm not  not so sure though, that it was someone she knew, per se. If Diane was routinely alone in the evenings at the plant to take calls and ""accept deliveries"", could there have been a late delivery that night, just as she was getting ready to leave? Could it have been a person who made deliveries there before, but wasn't someone she really ""knew"", but who had seen her and knew she would be alone? Who then tried to make sexual advances, taking advantage of her being alone and became enraged when she resisted?  Or did she have a stalker? Someone who had become obsessed with her, perhaps a co-worker, one that she herself didn't even know about? Presumably, if there were any truck drivers or deliveries that evening, there would have been a record of the delivery, but since none of the specifics of the investigation are in any of the articles I read, it's hard to say who they looked at. Perhaps there was a delivery earlier in the day, and the truck driver returned later when he knew Diane would be alone, and used some kind of ruse to have her open the door. The fact that she was found just inside the shipping door makes me think whoever it was came in that way.

There is just something so poignant about this case to me; perhaps it's because it's been unsolved for so long, 55 years, and so many people in her family are gone without knowing what happened to her. Perhaps it's because she was born about a year after my mother, and would be my mom's age now and there were some similarities in their lives. My mom wore her hair just like Diane did in her senior photo, my mom graduated in 1964, just a year or so before Diane (though not from the same school), and in 1966 my mom also had a fiance who was in the military (U.S. Marines) and also served during Vietnam.

Diane's life was taken from her, she never got to do all the things she could have. I hope that her family gets the answers they deserve, even if Diane's killer is no longer alive, then they can at least know.

618,Majestic-Studio-920,[],1636488148,"If I could solve one unsolved mystery it would be the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. This case is os interesting to me because i just have so man theories as to what may have happened. This case is one of the most well known cases in the United Kingdom and up until last year there were no leads on the case. Madeleine was born on May 12th, 2003 in Leicester, England. When Madeleine was three years old, her family when on vacation to Portugal. Her family stayed in a holiday resort with a couple other family friends. This resort was known to be pretty safe and so every night the parents would put the children to sleep and then go to the bar to hangout. The parents would then take turns checking on each of the kids to make sure that they were ok and had not woken up. However on May 3rd 2007, one of the parents went to check on the kids only to find that was Madeleine was missing. This was odd considering all of the other children were still in their beds including her twin baby brothers who were in the same room as her. 14 years later, this case is still a mystery and no one know where Madeleine is. There are many theories on the case however, for instance many believe that Madeleines parents accidentally killed her. People believe that in order to ensure that Madeleine would stay asleep they fed her sleeping pills but accidentally gave her too many to the point where she died and therefore they had to cover up her death. This is believed by so many because when the police brought in sniffer dogs, they led to the parents closet as well as the trunk of their car. Another theory is the Madeleine simply left that apartment on her own accord and then something happened afterward because it was mentioned that the parents would leave the back door to the apartment unlocked so that they could check on the kids faster and would not need a key for each of them. Another key piece of information is that the night she disappeared a couple of witnesses came forward stating that they had seen a man near the apartments carrying a girl that matched the description of Madeleine. Nothing ever actually came of this however because there was not even information for the police to actually find a lead. This case has always been so interesting to me because i think its crazy that there are simply no leads as to what happened and that it is still a mystery 14 years later.

621,True-crimer,[],1636466677,"Beverly left her residence in the 11300 block of Linnet Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, in the evening hours on August 24, 1951. She and a female friend rode their bicycles to attend the Showagon, an annual summer festival.  


The Showagon took place in Halloran Park, which stretches south for three blocks between west 117th and west 120th streets, about an eighth of a mile away from Beverly's home. The area around Halloran Park in 1951 had a number of large trees which obscured the streetlights and made the street almost completely dark after sunset, and vagrants sometimes frequented the park at night.  


Beverly had been forbidden to go to the park because she had home from there late a few days before, but her mother gave her special permission to attend the Showagon. Beverly and her friend arrived at the park shortly after 7:00 p.m., but came home again and left their bicycles. They then went back to the park, arriving at the carnival the second time at 8:00 p.m.  


Beverly had been given permission to stay until the show was over, but her friend had to be home by dark, and so left at 8:40 p.m. She stated that she last saw Beverly watching the show, standing in front of a small plump woman who had a hand on Beverly's shoulder. The woman may have had a child who was performing in the Showagon.  


The last confirmed sighting of Beverly was at 9:30 p.m., when the Showagon had ended and Halloran Park was emptying. A thirteen-year-old acquaintance saw a girl he believed to be Beverly walking diagonally across the park, headed in a northeast direction towards her home. He recognized her by her unusual gait.  


She was about 150 feet from the corner of Linnet and west 117th Streets when she was last seen. Her parents reported her missing at 10:30 p.m. when she had not come home and their search of the area failed to turn up any sign of her.  


Beverly is not believed to have left of her own accord. She is described as a shy, quiet, obedient girl and a good student who was due to enter the fifth grade at Louis Agassiz Elementary School in the fall of 1951. Beverly had a happy, stable family life at the time of her disappearance. She was also unusually cautious, particularly around men and boys, and would flee when approached by a stranger. She had been warned against unknown men but not against women, so it is possible that she was enticed by a woman.  


There have been many false leads in Beverly's disappearance and several possible suspects. Two months after her disappearance a man called her family and demanded $25,000 ransom for her return, but he turned out to be an opportunist who had nothing to do with the presumed abduction. Another man confessed to hitting Beverly with his car on the night she vanished, but his story was also proven to be untrue.  


In 1980, a retired Cleveland police detective claimed he had solved the case in 1974. He says he got a letter from the brother of a man who had fled the Cleveland area in 1966 after being charged with the abduction of two girls. The author of the letter stated that his brother had confessed to kidnapping Beverly. When investigators interviewed the brother, he confessed the crime to them, but the district attorney refused to prosecute him for lack of evidence. This story has not been confirmed by official sources.  


Another suspect is William Henry Redmond, a carnival worker who died in 1992. He had a long record for child molestation beginning when he was only thirteen, and had been awaiting trial for the 1951 murder of an eight-year-old girl, Jane Marie Althoff, when he died. He allegedly told a cellmate that he had killed three other girls as well as Althoff.  


Redmond has never been tied to Beverly's apparent abduction, however, and she is several years older than his other suspected victims. At the time authorities questioned him about the Beverly case in 1988, he refused to make any statement one way or the other about her disappearance. Redmond did pass a polygraph in connection with the unsolved 1952 disappearance of [Connie Smith](http://charleyproject.org/case/constance-christine-smith) from Connecticut.  


In 1994, a letter was discovered under the carpet of a house on Midvale Avenue on the west side of Cleveland. The letter was written in 1960 by a woman who claimed she had caught her husband disposing of Beverly's body in their furnace. Using real estate records, police identified and tracked down the writer, who was eighty-three years old by 1994. Her husband was dead. The woman admitted to writing the letter but said the story was untrue; she wrote it as a fantasy revenge against her husband because he abused her.  


In 2000, an unidentified individual wrote two letters to a Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter. The writer stated that he was dying, and confessed to molesting and murdering Beverly on the night she vanished. The letter's author promised to turn himself in to the police on August 24, 2001, the fiftieth anniversary of the Beverly's disappearance, but shortly before this date he sent a third letter to the Cleveland Plain Dealer saying he had to go to a nursing home and thus could not keep his promise to reveal his identity.  


Authorities launched an extensive investigation to identify the author of the letters, but they were never able to ascertain anything beyond that the letters were all written by the same person and that their author was probably an elderly, infirm man. Many investigators believe that the correspondence was genuine.  


In spite of a very thorough investigation and many leads from the public, investigators never found any trace of Beverly. Police believe she was abducted and murdered, probably by someone she knew and trusted, since she had such a shy nature and a fear of strangers.  


Beverly's mother died in 1956 and her father in 1970. Her older sister continued to search for her until her own death in 2006. Beverly remains missing and foul play is suspected in her disappearance.

623,Frequent_Swordfish59,[],1636456934,"**Joana Cipriano** 

Joana Cipriano was 8 years old when she went missing on August 12, 2004, from Figueria in the Algarve region in Portugal. I can’t find much about who Joanna was as a person, the only information from a website of true crime youtuber. According to this site, she was described as gentle, friendly, and a good student though some teachers had noticed something was off, others hadn’t noticed anything. The teachers said she had too many adult responsibilities at home and too many chores. They also stated she would sometimes cry at school but she wouldn’t tell anyone what was wrong. This website also states a formal complaint was filed against her family sometime in 2004, but the source is in Portuguese and I don’t trust google translate for this. There’s also conflicting information about who she was living with at the time, whether it was with her grandmother or her mother, stepfather, and two younger siblings.    

**Her disappearance** 

She was last seen at around 8 pm on the night of August 12 200 meters from her home on the way home from a local store where she had bought milk and a tin of tuna. It’s unclear if the milk and tuna were found at her home later or not. Her mother, Leonor Cipriano, launched a campaign to find her daughter and distributed posters around the neighborhood. 

**The investigation** 

The prosecution focused on her mother and her mother’s brother, João Cipriano. Their theory was that Joanna had witnessed her mother and uncle engage in incestuous sex. 

Her mother, Leonor, confessed to having killed her daughter after 48 hours of interrogation. She recanted her confession the next day, claiming she had been beaten. The police explained her bruised face and body were due to her throwing herself down some stairs to kill herself. 

João Cipriano confessed to having assaulted Joana but denied sexually assaulting her, stating he did not harm her but only kill her. He also said he had cut her body into small pieces and placed her inside a refrigerator before disposing of her by throwing her into a nearby pigsty, though other sources say the refrigerator was driven to Spain and crushed. 

Joana’s body has never been found and her murder trial was the first in Portuguese legal history to have been conducted without a body. João was sentenced to 19 years and two months and Leonor was sentenced to 20 years and four months. She was released in 2019 and continues to claim she’s innocent. 

Five officers including Gonçalo Amaral, the head of the regional Polícia Judiciária (the national crime investigation police agency), were charged with several offenses. The indictment alleged that several of the officers had kicked Leonor, hit her with a cardboard tube, put a plastic bag over her head, and made her kneel on glass ashtrays. Three officers were acquitted of torture. Gonçalo Amaral was not present at the time of the alleged beating but he was accused of having covered up for the other officers which he denied. He was convicted of perjury in May 2009 while working the Madeleine McCann’s case and was replaced by deputy national director Paulo Rebelo. Another officer António Nunes Cardoso was also found guilty of having falsified documents and received 2½ years suspended sentence.  

**Madeleine McCann connection** 

Figueira is only 11 kilometers from Praia De Luz from which Madeleine McCann disappeared on May 3, 2007. In both cases, the mothers launched campaigns to find their daughters and in both cases, the police investigated the possibility that their mother killed their daughters. 

Leandro Silva, her mother’s common-law husband, and Joana’s stepfather said in 2007 that “The only difference between the McCanns and us is that we don’t have money.” 

According to child protection specialist Mark Williams-Thomas who believes their disappearances are related, said the disappearance of two children unknown to each other within four years in a seven miles radius would be a huge coincidence.

He was one of the few children who were identified during the raid on The Wonderland Club, a CP website/organization. Despite Interpol and his parents recognizing him in the videos, and a likely sighting of him at Disneyland Paris, he is presumed to be dead now.

626,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1636422904,"Around 3am on December 22, 1939, 29-year-old William Joyce was driving along U.S. Highway 20, the boundary that separates South Bend, Indiana from Mishawaka, Indiana, when without warning, a man suddenly stumbled onto the snow covered highway directly in the path of his vehicle. Unable to avoid him, William’s car collided with the man, sending him flying more than 40 feet down the road. William attempted to render aid to the man, but after realizing the severity of his injuries, quickly drove towards nearby South Bend to seek help and look for a telephone to call police. 

When police arrived on scene, around 3:30am, they located the unconscious man alongside the highway. His injuries were consistent with being struck by a vehicle; multiple broken bones, including his neck, internal bleeding and hemorrhaging, and severe trauma to his chest, legs, and torso. However, investigators also discovered the man's hands were bound, he was missing a shoe, and his eyes and mouth had been wrapped in several layers of 2-inch surgical tape. When the tape was removed, a handkerchief with lipstick stains was found lodged in the man's throat. 

The man was later identified as 44-year-old Stephen Melkey, a factory worker, widower, and father of three from Mishawaka. Sadly, he never regained consciousness and died of his injuries en route to St. Joseph hospital. 

Evidence gathered at the scene painted a picture of what had happened to Stephen. Following Stephen’s footprints in the snow, police determined he had been dropped off by a vehicle around 140 feet from where Stephen had been struck by William. The car then backed up before driving away. Stephen was initially bound at the ankles as well, but was able to free his right leg. He could not, however, untie his wrists which were bound behind his back. 

Stephen then wandered aimlessly, in search of help. His footprints indicate he walked through a small wooded area, before turning and walking down a culvert, where he lost his shoe in the snow. There, it is believed Stephen sat down for a short period, before continuing to walk towards the highway. 

A second set of unidentified footprints were also found along the edge of the culvert, running directly adjacent to Stephen’s path in the snow. Although the footprints were never conclusively linked to Stephen’s case, investigators theorized it was possible his killer watched, lured, or even forced Stephen onto the highway. 

Detective’s immediately went to Stephen’s home located at 423 West Fairmont Avenue, in Mishawaka. There, they spoke to his three sons, Robert, 18, Leonard, 14, and Fredrick, 8, all of whom were asleep when they arrived. The boys told police they had last seen their father shortly before they had gone to bed at 11pm. According to them, Stephen had spent the evening studying a home correspondence course in the hopes of becoming a foreman at the Mishawaka Rubber and Woolen Manufacturing Company where he was currently employed. 

A quick search of the home failed to yield any clues. Nothing appeared to be out of place or missing, and there were no signs of a struggle or forced entry into the home. When police first arrived at the home, the front door was shut, leading them to theorize that Stephen was most likely lured from his home before being abducted. 

Police immediately brought several people in for questioning starting with a 27-year-old local waitress named Bertte Devos , and her soon to be husband. 28-year-old Alan Polomsky. Bertte worked for a local tavern called The Old Heidelberg. There, she became acquainted with Stephen, who was a frequent patron of the establishment. Eventually the two had a “friendly” relationship. This did not sit well with Bertte’s fiancé Alan, and on more than one occasional Stephen had gotten into several verbal altercations with him. 

The pair were questioned, however both denied having any information about Stephen’s abduction. According to them, they had spent most of the evening together out at a local tavern. They claimed Alan dropped Bertte off at home around 3:30am, and then he went home himself. They were released, however a short time later they were brought in a second time for a lie detector test, which they both passed. Police also compared tire prints left at the scene to both vehicles belonging to Bertte and Alan, and neither were a match. The couple were again released. 

41-year-old George Smith, a coworker of Stephens, was also brought in for questioning.  According to several people, George was also “fond” of Bertte and was seen several times arguing with Stephen at the tavern where she worked. However, like Bertte and Alan, after his vehicle's tires failed to prove to be a match, and he passed a lie detector test, he too was released. 

According to Ancestry, Frederick, Steven’s youngest son, was sent to live at an orphanage until he was adopted in 1946. He passed away in 2011. The two older boys, Robert and Leonard, joined the military. Sadly, Leonard died while serving in 1943 at the age of 16. His remains were lost at sea.  Robert passed away in 2004. 

Although police continued to interview potential suspects, an arrest was never made and the bizarre “blindfold death” of Stephen Melkey was never solved.

Now for whatever reason this John Doe case sparked some interest for me, probably because there is an actual photograph of this man and record of his existence, with some sufficient back story on the descendent in the days prior to his passing. Also for whatever reason he had a note in his pocket with the name ""Brad Lee Bodie"", which struck me as odd.

And to be honest the main thing that hit me was the overall appearance of the descendant ([shown here](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2888umca.html)) really caught my attention. The descendant has overall very unkept facial hair and side burns with very long and unkempt hair, this is also partly visible in 1 of the post-mortem photographs (viewable in the first link). 

The descendant was known to use the name "" James Allen Chastain "" and "" Leroy "". 

Another thing that is odd was his arrest on March 5th of 1974, a lot his changed since then but is there really no other available information other then a mugshot and some fingerprints? Maybe he provided them falsified documents of some kind. I could also not find any details on why the man was arrested. 

And finally why didn't this guy have any kind of documentation or identification (Yes I know a question that can be asked for any John/Jane Doe case)? Maybe he was attempting to evade past crimes (That might explain the fake names).

On June 24th 2014, the skeletal remains of a female child aged between 2-6 years old were found in a box in Honolulu, Hawaii.  NAMUS states the remains were found in a metal receptacle, which was found inside a box.

Due to the remains being so decomposed, it’s difficult to gather details, however the child was estimated to be between 2ft 9-2ft 11. From the coordinates given on NAMUS, it seems that the remains were found in the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.

Other than that, there’s no other information available. There are no corresponding missing child reports other than Therese Rose Walsh who I assume has been ruled out.

In 2012, six fingers belonging to a child were found in a zip loc bag in a dumpster located by an apartment complex roughly a 12 minutes drive away from the previous remains. Forensic results suggest that they belonged to a girl aged 2-4 years old. It’s not stated anywhere that these incidents are connected, though I thought to include it. 

There was another case involving human remains in 2015, where a vase was purchased containing various animal bones and skeletal remains belonging to an adolescent, though most likely not related.

I really hope this Doe manages to be identified. It breaks my heart thinking that a child was buried in a box and still has no name

A 74-year-old local hunting guide, Rivers led a party of four hunters around the area of Hell Hollow in the southwest woods of Glastenbury before he was suddenly lost.

After an unsuccessful initial search, many still believed that this knowledgeable woodsman would be able to survive and soon surface in town. However, this was not the case. Soon, more than 300 concerned locals and U.S. Army soldiers dispatched from Massachusetts’ Fort Devens combed through the vast wilderness for eight days, turning up not a single shred of evidence as to the whereabouts of Rivers.

The following year saw arguably the most infamous missing persons case in the history of Vermont: [the disappearance of Paula Welden](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/vt-student-body-found-1946-disappeararance-article-1.2603927). Welden was an 18-year-old student at Bennington College who decided to hike a leg of the Long Trail during Thanksgiving break when most of her peers had returned home for the holiday.

Last seen on Sunday Dec. 1, 1946 wearing easy-to-spot red and entering the Long Trail near Glastenbury Mountain, Welden never showed up for her Monday classes, spurring a massive search party of more than 1,000 people and a reward of $5,000. Despite the large turnout, numerous aircraft utilized, and variety of assisting law enforcement departments, no clues to her fate were ever discovered.

Many, including Welden’s father, criticized the authorities’ lack of sophisticated methods in handling the case, which actually served as the catalyst for the founding of the Vermont State Police seven months later. [The case remains open](http://vsp.vermont.gov/unsolved/missing/c/welden) to this day.

Exactly three years to the day after the vanishing of Paula Weldon, the Bennington Triangle saw one of its more seemingly supernatural disappearances. That day, a 68-year-old man named [James E. Tedford](https://books.google.com/books?id=y7CsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;dq=james+tedford+st+albans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj636rR-63bAhUIvlkKHVc7ADMQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20tedford%20st%20albans&amp;f=false)boarded a bus to Bennington after visiting relatives in St. Albans, Vermont. Numerous eyewitnesses, including the driver, later confirmed that Tedford had been in his seat as late as the last stop before Bennington. Yet when the bus finally pulled int o Bennington, Tedford was nowhere to be found.

After he implausibly vanished into thin air while inside a moving vehicle, baffled passengers noted that Tedford’s luggage and an open bus timetable remained on his seat. If the witnesses are correct, Tedford would have disappeared from his seat as the bus was traveling down Route 7 through the Bennington Triangle.

Nearly a year later in mid-October 1950, eight-year-old Paul Jepson went missing. He was last seen happily playing in the family pickup truck by his mother, who left to tend to pigs at the dump where she and her husband were caretakers. Then he vanished without a trace.

In addition to the hundreds assembled for a search party, a New Hampshire sheriff brought in a bloodhound to sniff out the missing boy. The dog was able to pick up his scent but abruptly lost the trail at a nearby crossroads, suggesting a possible abduction by a motorist.

As the case dragged on without resolution, some suggested that Jepson met an early demise at the hands of his parents and was dinner for the pigs. But, in keeping with the eerie feeling of the Bennington Triangle, the boy’s father told the Albany Times Union that it was perhaps “the lure of the mountains” that pulled in his missing son, as the boy had “talked of nothing else for days” prior to the disappearance.

Only about two weeks later, 53-year-old Frieda Langer, an experienced hiker and survivalist familiar with the area, went missing on the Somerset area of the Long Trail bordering east Glastenbury.

After hiking a brief half-mile with her cousin Herbert Eisner, Langer fell into a stream and set back to their camp to change her clothes, where her husband was resting with a hurt knee. But neither her husband nor her cousin ever saw her again.

Helicopters from the Connecticut Coast Guard and U.S. Army in Massachusetts as well as local aircraft from citizens and the Vermont Aeronautics Commission helped search for Langer. As many as 400 people, including the Massachusetts National Guard, meticulously searched the surrounding areas yet found nothing.

But soon they did find something and this became the only known disappearance of the Bennington Triangle where a body has turned up. Six months after she went missing, Langer’s corpse was found near the Somerset Reservoir — curiously, an open area that had been searched extensively numerous times in the previous months.

Yet even with a body, the case saw little resolution. The body had decayed so badly that no cause of death could be determined, only fueling further speculation about what kind of disturbing end she might have met.

Madison Scott

Hogsback Lake, around 20 kilometers away from Vanderhoof BC, is a cozy camping area with a dock on the lake. It was a popular area for young people to have parties due to the camping areas and isolation. It is far enough away that the noise of a party wouldn't bother anyone living nearby who might call the RCMP and get the party shut down.

The weather on May 27, 2011, was crisp, near 10 degrees Celcius, when young Madison Scott went to a campsite party at Hogback Lake. Madison went with her friend Jordie with the intention of attending the party then camping overnight to avoid driving under the influence as there was alcohol at this get-together.

The party at Hogsback Lake was around 50 people, and according to reports, near the end of the night some people showed up that were not known to most people and the mood of the night soured. Around this time most people decided to leave rather than stay the night at the campground.

Hogsback Lake

What Happened to Maddy?

Maddy's friend Jordie decided to leave around 2:30 but could not convince her to come with her because she was already set up at her campsite. Maddy tried to get Jordie to stay with her but Jordie was extremely drunk and had fallen into a campfire and just wanted to go home. Maddy decided stayed to spend the night at her camp by herself.

The last time anyone reported seeing Madison was 2:45 to 3:00 in the morning when Jordie left the party.

The next day some people came to the campsite to clean up and noticed that Madison's tent was still there but did not check to see if she was inside. It is noted that Madison's truck was still parked in the same spot as it was the night before. Aside from Madison's tent, no one else was at the campsite. Madison is a bright, intelligent and independent young lady 20 years of age. There wasn't any evidence at this time to make anyone think something could have been wrong.

One major issue that is probably caused a problem finding any clues was that the next night after Madison and Jordie went to Hogsback Lake there was another party, one significantly larger with around 150 people attending. At this time that no one reported seeing Maddy at the larger party. If we assume that whatever happened to Maddy happened the night before, any evidence that could have been found was probably inadvertently destroyed by the partygoers at this larger party.

Maddy's parents were concerned that she had not come home or contacted them on the 28th, but she was an adult. If she decided to stay another night then it was her choice. Cell service in the area was spotty at best so she might not have been able to call and let them know that she was staying an extra night.

But by the 29th Madison's parents had a bad feeling and after being unable to contact her on her cell phone they decided to go to Hogsback Lake and look for her. Once at Hogsback Lake, they found Maddy's truck at her campsite with her purse still inside, but her tent had been flattened out, and some of her belongings were inside but had been pushed to the sides of the tent. After they found that Maddy was not at the campsite they contacted the RCMP and reported her missing.

633,Th3Trashkin,[],1636360107,"For decades this infamous 911 recording has made the rounds, I don't know if I'm the first, but I think I've figured out exactly what happened, but before I get to that.

# Summary

So I'm pretty sure this case is well known among a lot of true crime enthusiasts, and it's been covered to *death* by Youtubers. But I'll do my best to quickly sum it up for those who are unfamiliar:

In the 1980s, an old woman by the name of Ruth Price, living alone, contacts 911 because of a man prowling around outside her home, she fears for her life. The 911 operator interrupts Ruth before she is able to give her address. In less than two minutes, the man seemingly breaks in, and brutally assaults and murders the elderly lady, her final blood curdling screams caught on tape. With her address unknown, help is not able to arrive. 

For decades this recorded call has bounced around, with people trying and failing to find a record of such an incident, some think it's complete fiction, others think it might be based on a real call, or that it's real, and that one of two Ruth Prices, one dying in 1988, another in 1994, could be the potential victim.

[Here is a recording of the phone call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrG1o8vESw), **WARNING** there's loud screaming starting at **35 seconds** in, so if you're at all sensitive to that, either skip the video, or pause BEFORE that point.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the constant question about this call is ""Was it real, or was it fake?"", however, I think that there's an angle that hasn't really been considered for some reason: This phone call is real, BUT the story that has been retold over and over again, is completely fake.

Buckle up, grab a drink, because this is going to be a long post, but I'm hoping to get some good discussion to see if others agree to this being the most likely solution to this decades long mystery.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR:

* **The call is real, not a re-enactment, not a fake training example**
* **HOWEVER Ruth Price definitely didn't die during nor directly after the call, and likely didn't come to any harm at all**
* **What we're actually hearing is Ruth panicking over an attempted break-in, not her brutal demise**
* **The story was invented by 911 instructors during the 1990s to make the tape more shocking and memorable**
* **This occurred in San Diego, California sometime between 1986 and 1992**

# HERE'S WHAT I THINK HAPPENED:

* Ruth Price was speaking with a phone operator, when an attempted break and enter happened, she started screaming while the man was trying to break down her door, or enter through a window.
* The thud sound we can hear towards the end of the recording is not a blow, but Ruth dropping the phone receiver and it hitting the wall or floor. Ruth possibly runs away to hide or to make an attempt to get out of the house and seek a neighbour for help - alternatively, her screaming scares the man off then and there, and she runs to shut the window or check what he's doing. 
* The man was likely just attempting a burglary - not out to murder an old woman. Alternatively  Ruth states early in the call ""looking for a guy"" perhaps this was a drug dealer looking for a ""customer who owed him money or a junkie looking to score some drugs? Who knows.
* Ruth was not murdered, nor was she harmed at all, she survived the brief ordeal, and passed away in 1994...
* However, her blood curdling, screaming panic made this the perfect tape to use to shock trainees for 911 call taking, so was born the legend of an old woman brutally murdered while on the phone with 911\*.
* I believe we don't have the full call recording,  and that the tape was cut by whomever first used it for training purposes, there's more to it that we'll never get to hear

# Guesses, and Assumptions about the Call:

* It's possible that Ruth called a *phone* operator, **NOT** a 911 call taker, probably out of habit; [San Diego had only introduced 911 in 1982](http://www.sddt.com/Commentary/article.cfm?Commentary_ID=141&amp;SourceCode=20150819tza&amp;_t=The+911+emergency+system+began+in+San+Diego), Ruth had lived most of her life needing to dial '0' for an operator to connect with emergency services; this call happened at most, a decade after that. This might explain why the woman seems disinterested, and isn't ""following the right procedure"", and even why she doesn't talk while Ruth is screaming - she's frantically trying to get the police or emergency services in on the call to take over.
* At the start of the call, she's just trying to pass Ruth off to the police department with some details to know what to say to them. Later, when Ruth is screaming, she's already trying to get the police on the line - at 0:42 of the video, you can hear ""Operator!?"" in the middle of the screams. I believe this is when the operator had patched in a call taker from 911 or the police department. That voice possibly sounds like another woman on the line, addressing the operator, or the (phone) operator talking to the 911 operator, it certainly doesn't sound like Ruth.
* There's nothing in the audio suggesting a struggle to me, that Ruth is being strangled or stabbed, there's no man's voice or even grunting/breathing from the supposed assailant. Ruth's voice never really gets much further away than would be reasonable for a corded receiver.
* The line ""somebody help me to breathe""  keeps showing up in transcripts. I think this a misinterpretation of her pleading to the operator, it could be ""somebody help me please!""  ""he's getting in, help please!"" ""(unintelligible, possibly ""can you"") send the police!"". Ruth sounds like a natural, life-long English speaker, ""Somebody help me to breathe"" just doesn't make sense, and it doesn't sound like she's being strangled either.
* My guess is that the deep ""thud"" we hear is Ruth dropping the receiver, and it hitting a surface, wall or the floor, you can still hear Ruth briefly in the recording before it ends, making a sobbing sound, this wasn't a killing blow.
* There are NO stories nor records about this supposed brutal murder of an elderly woman simply because there wasn't one. Not because this was ""before the internet"" - if there was such a slaying, in the same decade that saw Richard Ramirez do similar, who had only caught in 1985; would have the media, especially in California, all over a ""Nightstalker Copycat?"" headline.

# Facts Backing Up the Location, Time Frame and Who Ruth is:

The key to all of this is that Ruth begins to provide an address, ""thirty-eight seventy-seven"" - [you can hear that in this uncensored version of the call from ScareTheater's video](https://youtu.be/7-GlUTVk35Y?t=82), if you want to confirm for yourself - and during the call, she mentions her house having an apartment at the rear. There was a Reddit thread two years ago, that had found a ""**3877 35th Street**"", in San Diego, California. [From what I could see in Google Maps](https://imgur.com/a/x5hidhz), the house shares a yard with a small, two story house to its rear, with its main entrance appearing to be facing that same yard (and a garage facing the alleyway).

I mentioned ""between 1986 and 1992"", and here's why: the house at 3877 35th Street had last been sold in **1986**, [according to this listing](https://www.redfin.com/CA/San-Diego/3877-35th-St-92104/unit-3879/home/5321131).

[Ruth Price, who died in May 1994](https://www.familytreenow.com/search/people/results?first=Ruth&amp;middle=Mildred&amp;last=Price&amp;citystatezip=San%20Diego%2C%20CA&amp;rid=asl&amp;smck=JCUD4XI2Hgjqmt8KncJeAA) moved to that address in **February 1986**, later moving in **August 1992** to an address in El Cajon, California*.* The location matches the information given [in this obituary](https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/ruth-m-price-birth-1913-death-1994/88613986) which states it as her last address. The obituary and record back up the basic things we know about Ruth from the call, she was an old lady - born in December 1913 - making her somewhere between the ages of 73-78 depending on the year this took place, and indeed her home at the time has an apartment at the rear.

Unfortunately the records do have some discrepancies, they state that 3877 is her address up to the present day (and then lists the same address as a second entry, up to last year), and give yet another address in El Cajon dated 1998, despite saying clearly she was deceased as of May 1994. I can't explain the duplicate addresses, nor the second El Cajon address in 1998, but my assumption is that the house at 3877 stayed within the family, or that it's possibly owned by a landlord? Something to that effect.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So to sum it all up - Ruth Mildred Price, of San Diego, CA had an attempted break-in at her home sometime between 1986 and 1992. Her screams were so fearful and shocking that the tape of the interaction she had with a telephone operator was later used unofficially by trainers with 911 call-takers - who spread a sensationalized story that the operator's mistake cost Ruth her life. However, the break-in was either a failed attempt, or Ruth didn't come to harm during it, and she lived on until 1994.

I'm almost dead certain that this is what happened, the last and only possible way to maybe know for sure, is if there was some way to get a record of any police reports filed regarding 3877 35th Street, between 1986 and 1992. Assuming a) that Ruth had made a police report about the incident, and b) that the reports still exist, and are accessible over 30 years later.

I know this is a tired, ancient mystery, I doubt I'm the first person to come to this conclusion, but after watching a video from [Barely Sociable on the call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABEdDreTjI4) (not the first I've watched either), something possessed me to do some investigation of my own to try and back up my conclusion. I figure this sub would appreciate the post, hopefully it was interesting? Tell me if I missed anything.","The ""Murder"" of Ruth Price: A Lengthy Debunking"
634,Pestilence4825,[],1636359079,"[Sophia Felecita Moreno](https://charleyproject.org/case/sophia-felecita-moreno), sometimes referred to as ""Nina"" or ""Sophie"", was a 16 year-old girl who disappeared in Bryan, TX (town just outside of College Station where Texas A&amp;M University is located). She was married at 16 to an individual by the name of ""Abel Herrera"" who was frequently violent towards her. Moreno was last seen by her mother at a washateria, on Groesbeck and Palasota on May 11, 1979. She asked her mother what she wanted for Mother's Day and that she agreed to meet at a family gathering later that week to which she never showed up which prompted her family to report her missing. Foul play is suspected.

**Distinguishing Features:**

Hispanic female. Brown hair, brown eyes. Sophia has a burn scar on her left leg and a birthmark on her upper right leg. She has a tattoo of the  initials ""AH"" on her left hand between her thumb and index finger, and a tattoo of a cross is on her right hand. 

**Further Development:**

According to the article from 2012, the family is raising money for information regarding Sophia. 

According to a Websleuths forum, user 'randomgyrl' commented:  *""I spoke to someone who grew up in the same neighborhood as Sophia and was about the same age at the time.  Apparently Sophia was married so young because she got pregnant and back in those days, if you get pregnant you got married.  I have no way to prove this is true, but she was forced to get married. She lost the baby, and a lot of people apparently believe the abuse from the husband led to a miscarriage.  The person I spoke with said that after she disappeared the husband went back to Mexico for a long time.""* \- Oct 29, 2012

 Furthermore, 'jeanettem' commented: ""*The Husband Is still in the area, we just got information today. I am calling a detective tomorrow to touch base and hopefully get them to  bring him in for more questioning. The funny thing is that his own  family is starting to leak out information, that supposedly they have  know all along. The reason for the cover up I was told was because his  father was a preacher, and his brother whom he supposedly made carry the body to be disposed of was only 11 at the time. But the guilt is there,  I just know that we will find her soon. I have gotten a lot of support  from agencies and will hopefully be able to end this for the family. I  wont give up till Sophia is found and he is behind bars serving the sentence he so deserves."" -* Aug 8, 2012

As of now, no new developments have arisen and I couldn't find more information on her husband. No arrests have been made.

This is a weird link I came across. It seems to be some sort of archive of an old eBay listing.

What’s interesting is that it seems to look like one of the six remaining lost Faberge Imperial Easter eggs, and the seller seems to have tried to hint that it might be the original:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub_with_Chariot_(Fabergé_egg)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabergé_egg

Is this some elaborate hoax to make $50,000? I doubt it’s the original egg because surely the experts would have noticed this listing, or the person listing it would have approached the experts if they thought they had the original (since clearly they are aware of the connection).

But if it’s even “after” Faberge, as the title of the listing suggests…that would seem significant given that the egg’s appearance is otherwise known only from a blurry reflection in a single old photograph of the imperial egg cabinet, which the appearance of this one matches quite well.

What do you think? Could this be a copy made while the egg was still extant? Is it someone’s attempt to reconstruct the egg based merely on the blurry reflection photos and descriptions? Why don’t more articles about the egg use the image of this egg as an “illustration” of “what the original is thought to have looked like”??

637,walle637,[],1636334891,"I would like to share some calculations I made about the Rey Rivera case, specifically his supposed jump from the hotel rooftop.

The vertical distance between the rooftop and the room he fell into is 110 feet. The distance between the building and the impact hole is 43 feet. Apologies for the horrific formatting due to basic text. So…

110 feet=0 initial vertical velocity*t+1/2*32.2 feet/second/second*t*t
Time t of fall was 2.61 seconds. So…
Horizontal velocity=43 feet/2.61 seconds=16.47 feet per second or 11.24 miles per hour

What all this means is that the fall took a total of 2.61 seconds before he made the hole, and he was running on the rooftop of the hotel at 11.24 miles per hour. That’s VERY FAST for a 260-lb man wearing flip-flops in his 30s.

The rooftop gives you 50 feet (or 15.24 meters) of clearance before you jump. (Note: 11.24 mph has been converted to 5.025 meters per second.) So…
15.24=(5.025/2)t
Time t is equal to 6.066 seconds, meaning that he had a maximum of 6.066 seconds to accelerate to his speed of 11.24 mph.

Next, I will calculate his minimum horizontal acceleration before falling.
5.025*5.025=2*15.24*a
Minimum acceleration is 0.828 meters per second per second, or 1.852 miles per hour per hour.

There are things about this fall that are very bizarre. Once again, he is a 260-lb man wearing flip-flops in his 30s, yet the physics shows he had to have been sprinting beyond belief. This also implies that it is physically impossible for him to have been pushed off the rooftop. However, with the clearance given, perhaps this would be possible, given that he had 6 seconds or fewer to accelerate to this speed, which is significant.

638,carlsolomonsviolets,[],1636319531,"I had posted about this case on my old account, however that account has been deleted, but I still have the doc I write up, therefore I'm reposting it here. 

This case was brought to my attention by a relative who is Marilyn's (I believe) 4th cousin. She asked me to do some research into it as I'm into true crime and some of the extended family wanted to see if they could have any answers or just more info. So I figured I would also post here. 

Marilyn Milligan b. May 19 1966, age 11, went missing from Lexington MO mid-june 1977 after returning from out of town, having seen a movie with family friends. When they returned to Lexington MO Marilyn said she would walk the short distance home. The family friends found out at 1130pm that night that she never made it home and that her family reported her missing.

There were many theories as to what happened. Some family memebers believe her stepfather's uncle killed her then proceeded to bury her in a cornfield, some of them believe her mother's brother harmed her and disposed of her body (he had been incarcerated since 13 on a murder charge and was released in his early thirties, shortly before Marilyn disappeared, he passed in a vehicle accident after her disappearance). There have also been suggestions that she is arroyo grande Jane doe (https://identifyus.org/cases/full_report/46), although I believe she was ruled out. There are rumors that she was found deceased but those have been proven to be untrue after speaking with family.

The sheriff that was investigating the case has since passed away as has her father, stepfather, her mother's brother and the stepfather's uncle. No one can seem to trace where her mother or siblings are at this point (but there's a hint that one of her nieces/nephews are in browning MO searching for her due to a post in an online forum, though it has not been confirmed if this is accurate, and that her mother is ina nursing home somewhere in Lafeyette County, which again hasn't been confirmed).

A cousin of hers, who was in her 30s at the time of Marilyn's disappearance, has stated ""They haven't found her yet and they probably never will."" And that ""He buried her in some cornfield east of there"".

There is so little information out there and some of what is out there has been stated as incorrect from speaking with the family. I have been told a newspaper clipping of her with information exists but I havent found it anywhere (4th cousin says she is currently looking for it amongst her mother's belongings - if it is found I will post in the comments).

639,carlsolomonsviolets,[],1636318826,"This is a case with very little confirmed information available. Essentially the only things we know as 100% fact are his first and last name, and that he is a missing person. So please take some information with a grain of salt. Regardless, I feel as if this is a case that needs more attention brought to it. 

Jason William Noble Saul went missing around August 14/15, 1997 near Bullhead City, Arizona. 

Jason and a friend, Kenford J. Farley, went into the desert looking for crystals. As they were driving, their van became stuck in a grave road so the boys began waking to town, but split up roughly a mile into the trip. 

The last supposed sighting of Jason was at roughly 5am on August 15th. Kenford walked into the hospital in Bullhead City around 9am, with Jason nowhere to be found. 

Note that the last 'confirmed' sighting of Jason was never actually confirmed, it was just reported via Kenford. Which is why I listed his missing date as the 14th/15th, as no one but Kenford would truly know when he last saw him and could be easily fudging the time-line, whether out of guilt or to cover for Jason or someone else. 

There was once an article online (the link I attempted to use is dead) that stated that Jason was killed by a group of teenagers. There have been rumors that he was involved in a bad crowd and Kenford killed him There was a rumor that someone named Arron Welsh murdered him. It has even been suggested that je just ran away to start a new life away from his troubles. But this is all hearsay, and no one knows for sure what truly happened. 

The only photo of Jason is from 7 years before his disappearance, when he was 10 years old. 

Uncomfirmed: Someone who claims to be his stepsister posted in a forum that all other photos were lost due to a fire. She also stated that ""Noble"" was not part if his realy, legal name - it was a nickname given to him by her father as Jason was seen as kind and Noble. 

The stepsister also claimed that his mother did not report him missing right away as she was collecting SS benefits on him, and would no longer be able to have the income if Jason was presumed dead. Apparently Jason's mother also told her that there was a drug interference that happened is the desert, leading to Jason's disappearance. 



Kenford passed on December 5, 2000, at age 21. 

Jason's mother apparently passed in the late 2000s without ever seeing her son return home, dead or alive. 

This is a very odd case, somehow with so little information but also so much information/hearsay from people claiming to be personally connected. I just hope that one day Jason is able to return home.

My main reason is the fact that a few months after the killings, clothes belonging to the Walker family were found in the shed not too far away from their home. The clothes were soaked with blood and police believe that the killer/killers used them to get rid of the blood from their clothes. And according to the police, the shed was only known to the locals, and there was a small chance of strangers to find it.

This brings me to my main suspect, Curtis McCall, which I believe is responsible for the killings.

According to some local gossips, Curtis had an affair with Christine Walker, and he also owned a .22-caliber gun. When questioned, Curtis told the police that he sold his gun and he never had anything with Christine Walker. Investigators proceeded to test Curtis with a polygraph. Curtis was tested three times, but every single time, he was so nervous, that his polygraphs were not readable.

641,ChooChooT-Bone,[],1636310213,"**Background:**

[Lisa Maria Szasz](https://charleyproject.org/case/lisa-alaria-szasz-lazzaro) was born in Cleveland, Ohio on July 16, 1962 to Paul Alex Szasz, Sr. and Maria (aka Marion) Calci Szasz.  Paul Sr. and Maria had at least one other child (Paul Alex Szasz, Jr.) and divorced in or around September 1975 but remarried in or around February 1976 before ultimately divorcing a second time in or around June 1977.

Few details are available about Lisa's early life however it is known that she married Daniel P. Ozmun in or around 1980 and had two children with him (a son, Ryan, and a daughter, Raina) before they divorced in or around late 1988 after 7 years of marriage.  Lisa may also have had a relationship and/or marriage with Kevin K. Lazzaro however it is unknown whether they had any children together.

*\*\*\* Please note: the below details are in no way intended to malign Lisa's reputation and are merely offered as insight into the possible struggles and stressors she was facing prior to her disappearance. \*\*\**

According to publicly available court records, Lisa was a defendant in several criminal cases, presumably stemming from her possible struggle with drug addiction, in the five years leading up to her disappearance. To wit: Lisa was convicted of breaking and entering in Summit County, Ohio Common Pleas Court on or about August 30, 1995 and received 1-year suspended jail sentence and 3 years of probation; she was also ordered to make restitution, continue treatment with Summa Health Center, submit to random urinalysis/testing, abstain from alcohol and illegal substances, seek and obtain full-time employment, and have no contact with her Co-Defendant, Larry E. Porter of Cleveland, Ohio. In or around September of that year, Lisa was convicted of passing bad checks in Stow (Ohio) Municipal Court and was ordered to pay restitution and further sentenced to 6 months to 1 year of probation.

Lisa convicted of drug possession in Cuyahoga County, Ohio Common Pleas Court on or about May 13, 1998 and was sentenced to 4 additional years of community control but, for reasons unknown, stopped reporting to her probation officer by October 7, 1999 and a capias warrant was issued for her arrest on or about February 18, 2000. Two weeks before the capias warrant was issued, Lisa was charged with first degree child endangerment on or about February 4, 2000 and she pled not guilty plea to that charge when she was arraigned in Ashtabula County Common Pleas Court on February 24, 2000. 

She was taken into police custody on the capias warrant on or about March 13, 2000 and, during a hearing on the probation violation charge one week later, was found to have violated her community control sanctions but was released from jail with community control sanctions to continue. A pretrial in the child endangerment case was scheduled to be held in Ashtabula County Common Pleas Court on or about March 30, 2000 however Lisa disappeared without a trace on or about March 23, 2000.

**Details of Lisa’s disappearance and pertinent identifying details:**

Lisa was last seen in the [Andover, Ohio](https://imgur.com/a/NOcIE03) area on or about March 23, 2000. The following day, her white Chevrolet Blazer was discovered abandoned, with the keys still in the ignition, 30 miles away from her last reported location in a no-parking zone at Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport in Vienna Township, Ohio. No trace of Lisa was found at the scene and her parents reported her missing on March 27, 2000. Reportedly, she expressed concerns that she was being stalked prior to her disappearance.

Lisa is a 5’5” to 5’7” Caucasian female with hazel eyes and pierced ears. At the time of her disappearance, she was 37 years old, weighed approximately 135 pounds, had black hair, and was last seen wearing a light blue jacket, jeans, multiple bracelets, a wedding ring, and a necklace with a cross pendant. Some agencies may refer to as Lisa Maria Szasz-Lazzaro, Lisa Maria Szasz, Lisa Alaria Szasz, Lisa Alaria Szasz Lazzaro, and/or Lisa M. Ozmun.

Lisa’s father died in November 2007 at the age of 76 or 77 however her mother and brother both appear to still be alive as of the time of this write up. There has been very little publicity since Lisa went missing and her case remains unsolved.

1. Where is Lisa now?
2. Did Lisa actually abandon her car at the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport or was it abandoned there by someone else - possibly her potential stalker - as a red herring?

The DA has addressed the media and has stated that it is too soon positive identification of remains, or whether foul play might be involved. From her statements, it is unclear if anything happened at the party, or whether it involved alcohol and drugs.

Billerica was very different in 1982, and they will probably have to look into the state of the bridge, roads, lighting, etc that year. Hopefully they are able to determine what happened that night.

On March 3rd, 2020, the decomposed body of 41 y.o. graphic designer Pascal Cataye from Nice, France, was found in the wooded part of one of Rijeka's northernmost suburbs, Drenova. Seventeen days later, on March 20th, the partially burned body of 24 y.o. swimmer Eliot Charlet was found near the woods in Gornje Jelenje, outside the city of Rijeka and 30 km / 20 mi away from where Pascal's body was found.

Before going into what occured, I want to offer more insight into *where* it occured. Rijeka is the 3rd largest city in Croatia, and is located close to the border with Slovenia. Although Croatia is in the European Union, it is not in the Schengen zone. This means that you need to pass border control to get from Croatia to Slovenia. Once inside Slovenia, you can go anywhere in EU that is in Schengen - Italy, Germany, Sweden etc. In the last years, Croatia has had a steady flow of illegal migrants trying to pass through it in order to get to Slovenia. These migrants travel mostly through woods in order to remain undetected and have been known to break into unoccupied ""mountain homes"" that people visit on the weekends. However, there haven't been reported cases of them assaulting, let alone killing, anyone.

**Pascal Cataye**

Pascal, also known by his online nickname Daghostprod, was recently divorced and childless. Reports state that although his divorce was quite difficult, he had found someone else. His friends hadn't heard from him since January 18th, when he sent out packages with his personal things from his temporary home in Chartres. 

On January 21st, his friend Eric Bautry went to Pascal's house and discovered a hanging device. The police said that the device wouldn't work.

A young woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""They say he was depressed, which is not true. Pascal had a dark side. He had a more active side, which was sometimes replaced by a more discrete side, where we wouldn't hear from him for a while. But he always resurfaced.""

His friend Eric said that he loved nature and that he was happy when in nature. He also stated that Pascal had been to Croatia once before with his ex-wife, and wished to return.

Pascal also wrote comics, and his last work was titled *End.* He was found with a notebook and a bag full of sharpies.

Unfortunately, all articles about Pascal are in French, with some being behind paywalls, so I was unable to find out his cause of death, although an article did state that an obduction was underway. All we know is that his body was quite decomposed.

**Eliot Charlet**

Eliot left France from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on February 25th, 2020. At 15:35, he sent his mother a message that he had landed safely. The day after, his mother sent him messages asking if he was enjoying himself, but there was no response. His brother tried calling him, but his phone was turned off. Eliot's mother managed to report him missing on March 3rd in France, after receiving the information the day before that he had indeed entered Croatia and that he was neither in custody nor in a hospital.

Eliot's grandfather (who had, interestingly, been a bodyguard to Charles de Gaulle!) wrote to a croatian newspaper, saying that he had given Eliot 800 Euros (approximately two months' worth of croatian minimum wage) in order to have money before finding a job in a restaurant or hotel. He also said that Eliot's mother wasn't worried about his trip to Croatia, as they had fond memories of spending the holidays there.

Eliot's body was found on a meadow near the woods in Gornje Jelenje. He had been strangled and had signs of blunt force trauma on his head. His killer had tried to burn his body by dousing it in gasoline, which left it partially carbonised. A medical examiner found that 24 h had passed between his death and the discovery of his body. He also concluded that he had been murdered somewhere else and brought onto the meadow to dispose of his body by burning it. The killer was probably in a rush as something unexpected made it so that only the bottom part of Eliot's body was burned, which allowed for him to be identified and a cause of death to be determined.

As he was found near a popular migrant route, speculations arose that it might have been a case of an altercation between smugglers of migrants (non-migrants who arrange for them to be smuggled into the Schengen zone in exchange for large sums of money by the migrants themselves). It remains unclear what could make a young French swimmer involved with smuggling or smugglers. Others speculate that Eliot was a victim of migrants themselves.

**My thoughts**

\- I think there is a strong possibility that Pascal comitted suicide, but it's hard to say without knowing the cause of death

\- It is very strange for Eliot to be in Croatia and looking for work in a hotel or restaurant. Wages in Croatia are quite low, especially compared to France. Also, the language used in Croatia is - Croatian. I can't imagine someone who doesn't speak it being employed as a cook or waiter. However, there are a lot of tourists during the summer season, so hotels and restaurants will often employ more workers during the summer season, so it kind of makes sense for him to be there in that particular time of year, if he takes a few months to find a job.

\- We know Eliot's phone was turned off and he didn't have any communication with his family from February 26th onward. However, as per the medical examiner, he died somewhere around March 19th. This would mean that he was in Croatia for almost a month *while reported missing* from March 3rd onward, and deliberately not turning on his phone and not communicating with his worried family. If the ME is correct, this in my mind points to the fact that he was up to something shady. However, I think migrant smuggling is quite unlikely.","Unresolved deaths of two French citizens in Croatia, found 17 days and 30 km (20 mi) apart (2020)"
644,MistressGravity,[],1636295334," From this NBC [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dna-beer-cans-leads-arrest-1996-cold-case-murder-florida-n1283248):

Florida officials announced on Thursday a breakthrough arrest in the 1996 cold case murder of a man who was brutally stabbed 73 times — thanks to DNA found on several beer cans.

Terence Paquette, 31, was found murdered on Feb. 3, 1996, in the bathroom of the Lil' Champ convenience store on Clarcona Ocoee Road in Orlando, where he worked. His throat was slit and cash was missing from the store, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.

Sheriff John Mina described the murder scene as “gruesome”. He said the blood from someone who wasn't Paquette was found ""all over the store,"" but officials couldn't find a DNA match.

The case remained unsolved for 25 years until advances in genetic genealogy helped investigators hone in on the suspect, 54-year-old Kenneth Robert Stough, Jr.

Paquette’s case was reopened in 2003 and the DNA from the crime scene was entered into the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, also known as CODIS, but without any matches, Mina said.

In 2019, a cold case unit at the sheriff’s office was formed and investigators began to re-examine Paquette’s death.

In 2021, officials enlisted the help of a genetic genealogy specialist with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and used a DNA sample from a bloodstain on a freezer handle in the store, then determined the blood came from one of three brothers.

“We take the sample from the lab. We have a vendor turn it into a data file that can be uploaded to two public genetic genealogy websites — Family Tree and GEDmatch.com,” Debbie Abney, with FDLE, said at the press conference.

From there, officials built a family tree from the sample, which narrowed the search for the suspect down to the siblings.

Investigators then looked into those brothers and honed in on Kenneth Stough, who previously worked at the store and lived across the street from the shop in 1996.

In order to get a sample of Stough’s DNA to tie him to the case, investigators tracked him to a gas station in Lake County, where Stough was seen throwing away several beer cans. Those cans were later swabbed for DNA and matched the DNA from the crime scene, officials said.

Stough was arrested on Tuesday and has been charged with first-degree murder with a firearm and robbery with a deadly weapon, according to the arrest affidavit.

The public defender’s office that represents Stough declined to comment on the arrest.

Det. Brian Savelli, who worked on the case, said Stough had a record of arrests but for minor incidents. Savelli said Stough admitted to working at the store but did not confess to the crime.

Officials said they’re still working on a motive.

All of Paquette’s family has since passed away, but his friends were notified that an arrest was made in the case, Savelli said.

“We never, ever forget about these cases,” Sheriff Mina said. “Just because we don’t make an arrest in a case in a day or in a few weeks or even a few months doesn’t mean we give up on our victims or their families.”","In 1996, a man was found stabbed to death 73 times in the Florida convenience store he worked in. Now, 25 years on, an arrest has been made."

647,thinky-thing,[],1636241998,"
Craig Kielburger was a  celebrated child prodigy and traveled all over the world for a political cause. Even younger then Greta Thunberg at the beginning of his career, he was just 13 when he started campaigning for childrens rights. Everyone was intrigued by a small.boy showing them an ugly truth: Child labor still exists and the West benefits from it . He influenced Canadian Government policy, testified to US congressional committees, appeared regularly on TV. His goal was abolishing child labour. 

Craig was allegedly inspired  to take up his cause by another famous child campaigner from the other side of the world – Iqbal Masih. At the age of 12 Craig  read an article about Iqbal Masih. The article talked about Iqubals life, how at the age of four he was sold into bondage to work as a carpet weaver, how he worked 12 hours a day, six days a week. 

Craig told that story a million times. In his early speeches his outrage, disgust and shock about this ugly truth  is believable. "" I always thought, well, slavery, bonded labour, it’s something out of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries – it’s been abolished, it no longer exists.’

And he requests from adults, institutions and politicians to take the issue of child labor more seriously. 

‘The single biggest problem we’ve had is adults who will not take us seriously, who think that because we are young we will oversimplify the issue of child labour and not do our research. Many of our members are as young as nine or ten years old but we do our research as well as take action.’

Wanting to go beyond declarations, Craig, alongside his teenaged  brother Marc, founded a charity"" Free the Children"" in 1995 ( later rebranded in WE Charity in 2016) An international network to eradicate child labour. The charity is well known in Canada and England offering a free school curriculum and volunteer programs to developing countries. There was even a broadcasted WE Day on Canadian television. 

But before it got a big company one of the group’s first activities was starting a petition to free another labour activist imprisoned in India, obtaining about 3,000 signatures.

In the early years journalists, who traveled with Craig, called his mother the mastermind behind the political campaigns. She pulled the strings and helped organizing all the events and meetings. But it’s hard to say, if the origin story about Iqbal and all the political campaigns was his Mothers  or Craig's own ideas. 

Craig  Kielburger met the prime minister, the Dalai Lama, TV Journalists and Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who became a hero for him

""Of all the well-known people I've met, the person who inspired me the most would be Mother Teresa...she had this incredible power about her...because she had such a big heart. I asked her how she kept her hope in the face of so much poverty and she said 'we must always realize that we can do no great things, only small things with great love.' You have the spirit of Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela inside you. No matter what your gifts, no matter what your talents, kids can help change the world.""

In a letter Craig  wrote to newspapers the day Mother Theresa died, he said she “was not a president or a prime minister,” but she proved that one person can make a difference. ""

But did she ?  Mother Theresa's  followers are still believing she  displayed saintly qualities throughout a life dedicated to serving the poor.

But saintly is not a word everyone uses for her.  Critics say she was anything but. 
The Horrific Conditions At Mother Teresa’s Medical Centers And Missions. A reminded an Indian journalist of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Nazi Germany.

Though Mother Teresa’s medical centers were meant to heal people, her patients were often subjected to conditions that made them even sicker. 
some doctors took to calling her missions “homes for the dying” since her Calcutta home for the sick had a mortality rate of more than 40 percent. But in Mothers Theresa's view, this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.

She allegedly said, “There is something beautiful in seeing the poor accept their lot, to suffer it like Christ’s Passion. The world gains much from their suffering.”

Mother Theresa got excellent medical care through and traveled first class. Countless well-meaning Catholics gave money to Mother Teresa’s charitable organizations throughout the years, but many of them would never see their generous donations go toward good works.
The enduring mystery Of where Mother Teresa’s money Went is still not answered satisfyingly...and the same questions  and accusations about  Corruption, misused money is the WE Charity facing.  a murder for hire, a cult like following, abuse of workers...And not being a charity but a marketing firm are the endless accusations the WE Charity faces. 

And the question is: Where did it all go wrong ? Or was it never a good cause to begin with ? When did the charity  became a money making machine for his family rather than a charity and a social cause. 

WE has over $40 million invested in Toronto real estate and the Kielburger parents have amassed some $24 million worth of property.

And this was possible, because the non profit charity had a for profit sister company and funds were transferred back an forth. 
WE is essentially founded as  a two-part organization: WE Charity is the public non-profit on one side, and Me to We is the private “social enterprise” ( for-profit) organization that funds much of the activity of its charitable arm. While the practice of corporations giving money to their philanthropic arms is commonplace, the practice of charities giving money to their corporate entities is highly unusual and questionable.
A troubling blur of charitable and commercial activities. 

It seems no one was looking into this complicated structure of the WE Charity  for over two decades.  Until WE Charity was selected for a $900 million COVID contract to oversee a student service grant in Canada to help students with volunteering. There was suspicion of briber and corruption, because the WE Charity wasn't seen as the most competent company to get such a huge contract and lacked experience in that area. 

The WE Charity's COVID contract was canceled  after a huge public outcry prompting two Canadian Parliamentary committees to launch an investigation.
The  Kielburger brothers testified under oath they paid Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family nearly a half-million dollars in speaking fees for WE Day events.

But what actually is the WE Charity doing: from  high school clubs to international development projects to ethical chocolate sales to mental health advocacy the charity seems to do everything and nothing. 

WE Charity claims on its website 90% of donations from the U.S. and Canada 'support programming' while only 10% goes towards 'administrative costs.'

In 2000 WE Charity gained money and funding for a school building project after appearing on Oprah. They claim 1,500 schools and school rooms have been built across the world with those funds. But, the nonprofit has been unable to provide a list of each location to the Parliamentary committee.

They just send photos of several hundred buildings.  Sometimes showing the same building more than once. The charity could not say where those schools are, who the students are, who the teachers are. How can we even prove they even exist ? 

The lack of clarity is leaving donors with more questions about where their money went - something the journalist and donor Reed Cowan knows well. 
After his son Wesley died in a swinging accident, Cowan honored his legacy by raising money to build a WE School in Kenya in 2009. The school plaque was inscribed with Wesley's name. But, Cowan testified he learned years later, WE Charity replaced his plaques with other donors several times.

Why would a plaque ever be taken down? Is there a circumstance other than committing fraud even possible ? 

Allegations have surfaced that multiple donors have been funding the same projects at WE Schools in Africa.
Someone even said that these plaques to honor donors might as well have velcro on them because they were removed and replaced so rapidly.

And there were several other indications that the WE Charity worked like a corrupt marketing agency rather than a charity.

In the age of “corporate social responsibility,” giant corporations  don't want to look like the bad guys. Microsoft, Dow Chemical, Allstate Insurance, Hershey’s, Teck Mining – All  these companies were used to being blamed and boycotted and all are to a degree still involved in child labor.. But by donating to WE Charity, they got more than tax benefits - they got a whole new PR strategy. And they Show social responsibility and how they are deeply concerned about exploitation of children, even when they directly or indirectly still benefitting from child laborers.  WE basically sold a marketing strategy to the world’s biggest companies. 

WE Company has no problems to cooperate with company's and hotels where child labor was a frequent issue. Youth in oversee exchange programs saw child laborers working in the same hotels they were staying. Those volunteers felt deeply uncomfortable seeing child laborers and later in life questioned the whole program. 

And WE Charity employees reported the company was structured like a cult around  the Kielburgers. They were expected to worship the brothers and to work on or even below  minimum wages. Craig Kielburger even did speeches where he sold this idea as a strategy to other firms. So don't exploit children but all adult workers (?) 

And it gets  even worse in 2018 and 2019 at least 180 workers were paid to manipulate Google’s search algorithm to promote positive stories on WE Though who hired them is unclear.

Two different micro job offers were posted to Microworkers.com . An anonymous employer offered on each occasion to pay at least 90 different workers between $0.15 and $0.18 to try to manipulate Google search results in WE’s favour.
Based on the information on the Microworkers.com, both the aforementioned job offers were completed.

The WE story gets even stranger and downright scary when it comes to the WE Charity's conduct in Kenya.

Kenya was the main base, Model country out of the Canadian head Quartier, the jewel in the crown of the WE Organization's global empire. The WE organization took celebrities and CEOs for life-changing ""experiences"" with needy children, followed by stays in their 5-star luxury beach resort to Kenya. You can call it ""White Savior Tourism""

 It's also where WE co-founder Marc Kielburger hired a private security firm staffed by an ex-Israeli military operative and a Sri Lankan fugitive to deal with Kenyan employees who Kielburger thought were robbing or blackmailing him. But employees in turn accused Marc of kidnapping them and financial misconduct. This is an explosive and convoluted tale of death threats, bribery and corruption in a country where WE was supposed to be helping.

The scandals of WE Charity lead to the closure of nearly all overseas programs. Canadian schools refuse to work with the WE Charity, but WE Charity is still active in the US and providing free school curriculums and WE Clubs still exist in California and a few other States...

But even with all the fraud and dysfunction some journalists see nothing wrong with providing a school curriculum: 
To motivate other young people to  get involved in global issues, primarily through WE Schools in their eyes is still better than what other corporations do. But isn't the WE Charity selling a lie ?  There are no easy ways to abolish child labor 
The main problem with WE is that it has directed young people towards ineffective international political actions and a narrow understanding of what it means to do good in the world.  White student volunteers often use their stay in a poverty stricken country as their main focus in college applications. It's nowadays nearly a must do to get accepted to an Ivy League program. So it's self serving...

WE and other non-governmental organizations have sold a new form of ""White saviourism"" a neoliberal form of “charitable” social services delivery onto poor countries in the Global South.

And this needs to stop... Schools and universities should not encourage fraudulent programs and privileged-white saviour-tourism. That's not helpful...it's part of the problem...

But still ...what puzzles me most: Was Craig Kielburger ever truly concerned about the injustice of child labor (?) What role did the  Kielburgers parents play and was it from the beginning a deliberately fraudulent company? Why is their curriculum  still allowed on American schools  ? And how can you do better  ? Is there any hope left ?

648,macabre_trout,[],1636241666,"The recent post on the Kutztown Baby Doe reminded me of a similar case that happened near my hometown in the spring of 1994 (I believe it was February or March). A dead baby girl was discovered in a wastebasket in a women's bathroom at Dundee High School in Dundee, Michigan, a small farming town about halfway between Ann Arbor and Toledo. 

Our local newspaper reported on the discovery and the search for the baby's mother for a few days, and then nothing else was reported until a few weeks later, when she was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery in Monroe, the closest city to Dundee. Her headstone reads ""Baby Jane Myra"" with the date of her discovery, and the people who erected the headstone explained that her nickname came from the fact that she was a Jane Doe, and because Myra means ""weeping"".

I was around twelve when this happened and don't recall if she was found to have been stillborn or if she was murdered shortly after birth. It seemed like the story was silenced fairly quickly, and I've always secretly wondered if her mother was a member of a prominent or ""respectable"" family in town. I do remember speculation that it may have been the baby of a homeless woman or a transient, but who would sneak into a high school after hours to deliver a baby, of all places? It had to have been a student or school employee.

I wasn't able to find anything online about her, unfortunately (and Find a Grave doesn't list her gravesite). Her existence has been immortalized in one unique way, though. Pearl Jam's album ""Vitalogy"" came out later that year, and a short piece of writing about her by Eddie Vedder was in the liner notes. No one from my town knows how he found out about the baby, since it didn't make national news to our knowledge.

""THE LADIES' ROOM...... In a suburb of Detroit, Dundee to be exact, a newborn baby was found in a ladies' room wastebasket... It was in a state of non-living suspension... I imagine the stall and the pain and the echoed moans of lonely, desperate, anguished childbirth... I hope she was able to feel relief... I am sorry for the soul in the child... That soul will get another shot I do believe... So will the girl, I hope. It wasn't free.""

I wish she could be DNA tested, but I doubt that would be a priority for the Monroe Police Department. So those of us who lived there at the time will just remember her for now.

650,annemoriarty,[],1636225274,"On the morning of May 6 1996 a 24 years old woman called Nada Cella was murdered in her office. She was working as a secretary on the second floor of a building in Marsala street in Chiavari (Italy), where the firm of the accountant Marco Soracco was located. Nada had worked there for 5 years; the case is still unsolved, but recently a new lead was considered again, the case was reopend and may finally be solved.


*** Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my native language.


- The victim


Nada Cella was born on July 5, 1971 in Chiavari. Her family and friends describe her as a shy, introverted girl, dedicated to family and work, with few hobbies  (the gym, cinema and photography). Since 1991, Nada had worked as a secretary in the firm of the accountant Marco Soracco and had thus achieved her own economic independence. She lived at home with her patents and her sister.


- The murder


It is not clear at what time Nada arrived in the studio because no one saw her enter the building. However, we know that at 7.51 am she turned on the computer and worked on the computer for nearly and hour,  then at 8.40 am a client made the first of four phone calls to the office (more about this detail later).


 The assault took place between 08:50 am and 09:10 am. There were no signs of forced entry and no traces of a fight or defensive injuries. The attack was fast, she was hit with one blow after another, without esitation. Nada must have fainted almost immediately as the assailant continued to attack her (presumably ) even when she was on the ground. Three types of injuries were found: some of them were caused by punches and / or kicks, some other were caused by a blunt instrument (almost certainly an object with a sharp edge, but the weapon has never been found), the third type of injury was caused by a very violent impact against a flat surface, probably the floor, causing fractured cranial lesions;  according to medical reports these were the most lethal injuries.


Nada, unconcious but still alive, was found by her employer Marco Soracco, who had arrived at the office about ten minutes late, around 09:12 am. Soracco found the door of the building closed but the light in the entrance hall was on; therefore he thought that there were some clients inside, because that light (when there were no clients) always remained off.
Then Soracco entered his office (the first on the right after the entrance hall) and immediately the telephone rang; he answered after a few rings, had a brief conversation with the interlocutor (a client) and, after hanging up, went to Nada's office to understand why she had not answered the phone.


 As he entered he heard a strange gasp, then he saw Nada lying on the ground, supine, in a pool of blood, her head touching the wall, barefoot (that morning she was wearing moccasins, that were later found in the office), her glasses were on the floor and her purse was under the desk. He approached to understand what had happened, touched her face and then rushed to the office used by another employee (who would arrive at work about 15 minutes later) to call for help; it was 09:15 am. This timeline was confirmed by the telephone records. Nada was breathing badly and bleeding. Soon after, Soracco phoned his mother, who lived upstairs. The ambulance arrived at 09:20 am and found Nada lying on the ground, shivering, her eyes wide open and blood leaking from her mouth, ears and various wounds on her face and body. At 09:30 am the ambulance arrived at  the hospital. After some desperate attempts to save her life, at 11:30 am Nada was transferred to the San Martino hospital in Genoa, where, after a last vain attempt at resuscitation, she died at 2:10 pm.


- Investigation


Right from the start, it was difficult to investigate precisely, as the crime scene was altered first by the rescuers and then by Marisa Bacchioni, Soracco's mother, who was known to be a clean freak and washed the entrance hall and the stairs of the building, which had been smeared with Nada's blood all along the path from the office to the ambulance. Soracco and his mother had no medical skills, and therefore had immediately thought of an accidental fall; the rescuers too had not understood what had actually happened and thus didn't preserve the crime scene. The only blood traces that were not cleaned  were those present in Nada's office, but they were not particularly useful because the blood came from a venous hemorrhage; the blood had therefore flowed out without gushing, allowing the attacker not to get his shoes dirty: in fact there were no bloody footprints.


According to the medical examiner the murderer had to be covered with Nada's blood splatters, at least on the torso and upper limbs used to hit the victim. In fact, as testified by a woman living in the apartment below the office, the water from the bathroom in the office was heard flowing for a long time and abundantly. Maybe it was the killer trying to wash before leaving. The only possible escape routes were the stairs and an elevator, inside which a stain of Nada's blood was actually found. Another clue, which for many years was not valued, was a button found near the body. This object will be considered crucial in the latest investigations, reopened in 2021; in fact, the attention of the investigators will focus on it. 



The only certain thing is the time of the attack, because a person living in the building heard a violent thud (which could be the blow against the flat surface that flattened the victim's skull) at 09:01 am.
She was certain of the time because she was looking at her watch at the exact moment she heard the commotion .  Apart from that and the sound of water mentioned before, no one had heard or seen anything anomalous, so much so that the newspapers at the time nicknamed the building as ""the palace of the blind and the deaf"".
It was really strange that nobody heard or saw other things,  considering the amount of people that entered and exited the building that Monday morning (the cleaner of the common areas of the building, a man who returned from his night shift, a mother who had brought her son to his grandmother and then went out with the dog and for shopping).



At 09:05 am one of the tenants of the building left his apartment (located on the third floor), used the descending elevator to exit, and then found the door of the building closed. Realizing that he had forgotten some documents, he turned around and, finding the elevator occupied, perhaps by the murderer, went back to his apartement using the stairs, where he crossed two other people living in the building. The three noticed nothing unusual or suspicious.
Almost certainly, Nada knew her attacker. Perhaps he was a regular in the building, and for this very reason he went unnoticed, even though it is not known how he got rid of the bloodstained clothes and the object used as a weapon. 


A clue neglected by the investigations concerns some telephone calls, almost consecutive, that arrived to the phone in the office. On that morning a client phoned the office four times between 8.40 am and 9.20 am. The first call had no response, while the second was answered by a female voice. The woman, annoyed, stated that it was not Marco Soracco's office. At the third attempt, made shortly after the second, the same voice replied that she had the wrong number. The client, who had written down the number to redial it, tried again. On the fourth time, however, Marco Soracco responded and invited her to call at another time because the secretary had been attacked. 
The investigators never acquired the phone records to ascertain whether the woman had really dialed the right number that morning. 



- The suspects


The first person to be entered in the register of suspects was the employer Marco Soracco. The investigators assumed that he was a rejected suitor, but he has always denied that he was attracted to Nada. He also declared that he had never had particular familiarity with her because they talked exclusively about work, adding that he did not know anything about her private life. The investigations and searches of Soracco's properties did not lead to anything and he was officially cleared after one year of investigations. 


Another person under investigation was a woman living in the same building. She was a psychiatric patient, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, but was soon exonerated because, in addition to not having a motive, she had an alibi. 


The so-called ""cappuccino lead"" was also taken into consideration. A receipt issued by a bar on the evening before the crime was found in the trashcan of the office, and it was assumed that it might belong to the murderer. However, it turned out to be from a person living  in the building, who used to get rid of public transport tickets, receipts and cigarette butts by just throwing them on the stairs and in the common areas. This receipt had in fact been collected by the cleaner of the building and was put in the trash. Moreover, this person did not even know Nada. 


An ex-boyfriend was also taken into consideration, but, in addition to being provided with a strong alibi, he turned out to be responsible for the end of the relationship, having taken the decision to end it; besides that, for some time he had no longer been interested in her so there was no motive found.



At the end of 1998 the case was dismissed, Soracco and his mother were exonerated. In November 1999, an investigation was carried out on a man in the area, guilty of the murder of a Serbian prostitute. In 2005 the case was reopend, starting from Nada's diaries. In 2006 the Genoa Public Prosecutor's Office investigated two other men for the crime, who were involved in an investigation into a prostitution racket. In 2011, yet another attempt was made with three hairs found on the crime scene that did not belong to the victim. Nothing came from this later investigations. Several journalists have tried to shed some light but to no avail. 


- The case may be solved?


In May 2021, the Public Prosecutor of Genoa announced that there were new elements to try to solve the case, thanks also to the support of advanced technologies, which in 1996 did not yet exist; these new elements were some female and male DNA profiles found on Nada's blouse and office chair. In early November 2021, a 53-year-old woman, who was 28 at the time of the crime, was entered in the register of suspects. Her name is Annalucia Cecere, a former teacher. Marco Soracco and his eighty-nine-year-old mother, Marisa Bacchioni, are also part of the investigations. For them, however, the accusation is that of false declarations.

 

The credit for the reopening of the case goes to Antonella Pesce Delfino, who arrived in Genoa in 2018 to take a course in criminology. When she had to decide the topic of her final thesis she choose the unsolved murder of Nada Cella. Her research brought to light how poorly conducted was the investigation, the contamination of the crime scene, the lack of collaboration between law enforcement and magistrates. Her research pointed to a new conclusion: Nada could have been killed by Annalucia Cecere, who was in love with Soracco.
Crucial, in her investigations, was the testimony, never really taken into consideration, of two witnesses who that morning saw Cecere pass by the road to Soracco's office around the time of the crime. In addition, a neighbor of the suspect told the carabinieri that Cecere had left her home very early on the morning of the murder, which was unusual.
Allegedly, Annalucia Cecere had met Soracco at a dance class and during some parties a few months before the murder. She was briefly investigated at the time. During the first investigation, the newspapers speculated that there was a relationship between the two. Soracco denied any relationship. Cecere left Chiavari shortly after the crime and then settled in a small town in northern Italy. In 2017 she was hired at a school and was then fired five months later with a disciplinary measure. But why would she kill Nada?  According to investigators, the suspect was in love with Soracco but he was in love with Nada. In fact, Soracco himself, in a recent interview, spoke of a girl in love with him without his knowledge and who had already once looked for him at the office. Probably this was the first meeting between Nada and the suspect. 
 Soracco is now being investigated together with his mother, because it is suspected that that morning he saw the alleged murderer leave the office, but decided to cover for her over all these years.


 In recent months, dozens of people have been heard. There are several elements analyzed that led to Cecere. The now 53-year-old woman had been investigated from the start but was quickly dismissed because she had an alibi. At her home, the investigators at the time had found some buttons in a drawer identical to the one found under Nada's body. They were buttons of a men's jacket that the alleged murderer would have removed and kept because of their value. Now the definitive turning point could come from the DNA examination. 


“We have trust in justice and we hope that the truth finally comes out”, was the first thought of Nada's mother, Silvana Smaniotto. ""We are happy with this turning point, that was caused mainly by the criminologist Antonella Pesce Delfino who, with her intuitions, convinced the Prosecutor to reopen the case ""

On February 15, 1993, a newborn boy was found in the trashcan of a ladies room at Kutztown University with his umbilical cord still attached. He was found on the first floor of the Old Main building of the University. He had been cleaned and put into a plastic bag. He had been killed (and presumably born) hours earlier. He had red/auburn colored hair.

This case is really sad to me for multiple reasons, but one of the main ones is that I'm guessing it was an unwanted pregnancy from a college student. Considering that the baby was dumped in a University bathroom, it was probably a mother who couldn't afford/didn't want to get an abortion and saw no other choice. What do y'all think happened?

Rudi Moder disappeared in February 1983 after setting off on a two-to-three day ski tour of the Rocky Mountain National Park in the US state of Colorado.

US authorities think they have recovered the remains of a 27-year-old German man who went missing in the Rocky Mountain National Park almost four decades ago.
Rudi Moder, from what was then West Germany, disappeared after setting off on a two-to-three day ski tour in February 1983. He was reported missing six days later.

Human remains discovered

Skeletal remains found last summer are now believed to be Moder's, park officials said Thursday.

 A hiker discovered human remains near avalanche debris in August 2020, but massive wildfires in the area prevented a thorough investigation from being carried out. Snow then blanketed the area above 11,000 feet (3,353 meters).
Park rangers returned to the area this summer and found skis, poles, boots and other personal items that are thought to have belonged to Moder.

Identification proved difficult

The Grand County coroner's office tried to confirm the identity of the remains through dental records, but the results were inconclusive.
However, US officials say they consider the case closed and are working with the German government to repatriate the remains.
Moder started his excursion over Thunder Pass and into the park on February 13, 1983.

Only food and sleeping bag found

A food cache belonging to Moder was discovered at the mouth of a canyon in the northwest corner of the park, while his sleeping bag, equipment and provisions were found inside a snow cave.

The search included teams on skis and snowshoes, a dog trained to find people in avalanche debris and a helicopter. Additional searches were conducted over the next few months",US: German skier's remains believed found after 38 year

US radio persona Howard Stern is known for being something of a 'shock jock', with his shows often covering some fairly dark topics.
But one of his most sinister and quite upsetting moments came when he received a call from a man who claimed to have murdered 12 prostitutes.

On August 13th in 1997 a man named ""Clay"" called into the Howard Stern show and admitted to killing 12 prostitutes. Howard subtly asks questions to attempt to get identifying features of the man but to this day, Clay has not been identified.

Clay says that he doesn't really know why he kills prostitutes and that it may be for a feeling of power he gets over them. 

""I wanted to baffle people, but it turned out that no one noticed for a long time,"" he told the host.

""I never sent the clues, I never left anything, you know, I wanted to add my little signature.""

When asked about the timeline of his alleged murders, Clay told Stern and his producer Robin that he hadn't killed in almost a year.

And when the host asked if he planned on killing himself, Clay said: ""If I killed myself, I'd miss the next Batman movie.""

Chillingly, he then went on to explain why he hadn't murdered another woman in almost 12 months.
""I really don't know, Howard. Part of it had to do with my car broke down,"" Clay said.
""Well, that was the reason for a month, but after that, I guess it was all self-control.""

Howard then asked him if he still wanted to kill women.

To which Clay replied: ""Sure.""

The very dark conversation continued with Howard and Robin asking Clay about whether he enjoyed the act of killing, and how he did it.

The FBI asked Howard to turn over copies of the phone call but have not mentioned any information on the case or potential suspects. 

Howard keeps the man on the phone for over 15 minutes and asks questions to try and understand why Clay is killing prostitutes. Together, Howard and Robin try to gain information from the man about potential identifying characteristics. 

Clay admits to killing prostitutes in at least two states. Louisiana and Mississippi. 

The phone call starts out a bit rocky as Stern goes to the phone call and asks ""Is this Ed? Ed?""
In a somewhat aggravated tone of voice, the caller answers ""No. I never said my name was Ed"" almost as if to say ""How dare you get my name wrong"".

According to multiple reports, what grabbed the FBI's attention during the phone call on The Howard Stern Show was that the caller revealed information about his murders that authorities say they never made public.

Grunst was living in Milwaukee at the time and looking for work there. She made a call from a Pittsburg, Kansas pay phone at 11:40 a.m. on October 9, 1984, the day after she left Joplin. She has never been heard from again.

Grunst's mother stated her daughter loved traveling and hitchhiked frequently at the time of her 1984 disappearance. When she left Joplin she was carrying a large sum of money and a brand new, expensive suede coat, both of them gifts from her brother, so her mother theorizes Grunst was robbed.

Police identified and questioned the truck driver last known to be with her, and he reportedly gave inconsistent statements, but there was insufficient evidence to file charges against anyone.

Grunst has previously visited truck stops in Wisconsin, California and Canada. Her mother believes she is dead.

Why the police did not surveil the truck driver who was the last known person to see Grunst alive, and who gave several inconsistent statements about his encounter with her, is beyond my comprehension.

 Aiaz was last seen in Irvine, California on November 22, 2019. She disappeared with her twelve-year-old daughter, [Melissa Fu](http://charleyproject.org/case/melissa-fu). On the day of the pair's disappearances, Cheng Zhang, who is Aiaz's husband and Melissa's stepfather, was home with Melissa at their apartment in the vicinity of Michelson and University. Aiaz was driving home from Las Vegas, Nevada with a carload of produce they planned to sell at the market.  


Someone knocked on the door at 4:30 p.m., and when Zhang answered, he saw a woman and man he did not recognize. The woman had something in her right hand. Zhang felt something wet and misty on his face, then collapsed, unconscious. When he woke up hours later, there were bloodstains of the carpet and a bloody handprint on the kitchen wall. Melissa was gone. Aiaz should have arrived home by this time, but she was gone too. Neither of them have ever been seen again.  


Zhang found a white lined paper with handwritten instructions from the kidnappers in Chinese. The note said Aiaz and Melissa were okay and would be home in a few days, but only if Zhang didn't contact police; if he did, the note warned, he would never see his wife and stepdaughter again. The note instructed him to clean up the apartment and act normal until they returned.  


After the abductions, Zhang followed the kidnappers' instructions and carried on as normal for a week. He cut away the bloody carpet and replaced it, painted over the bloody handprint on the wall, posed as his wife on WeChat, and told his stepdaughter's school she was home sick. He found his wife's Ford Explorer parked in its usual spot, still full of the produce, and sold the food.  


He stated that during this period he would sometimes find notes slipped under his door, telling him he was doing fine, would see Aiaz and Melissa soon, and to keep behaving normally. Five days after the abduction, he got a fifth note, telling him his wife and stepdaughter were still fine but he should leave town for two days. He went to Las Vegas, stayed with a relative, and returned two days later to find a sixth, final note telling him again that everything was fine, instructing him to clean the house again, and saying he would see Aiaz and Melissa in a few days.  


When those few days passed without any more notes and without his wife and stepdaughter reappearing, Zhang finally went to the police. This was on December 2. Authorities were initially very skeptical of his account of the kidnapping and the events that followed. However, an extensive investigation, including more than 40 hours of interviews with Zhang, and 44 days of round-the-clock surveillance of him, did not disprove his story and in fact tended to support it.  


Zhang did not behave suspiciously during the time he was under surveillance, and he directed police to where they found find the physical evidence he'd tried to cover up or destroy. He had thrown out the bloodstained carpet, but forensic techs found blood on the padding underneath, blood which they believe was Aiaz's. When investigators looked into sprays that could instantly knock someone out, they found out an anesthetic drug called Fluothane matched that description.  


The abductors are described as both being in their forties and apparently of Chinese descent. The woman was 5'8 tall with an average build, and black hair pulled back in a bun. The man was 5'10 and about 190 pounds, with an average build and short black hair. They may have been driving a black Cadillac.  


Prior to her disappearance, Melissa had talked to her grandmother daily. They have not spoken since the date of the child and her mother's alleged abduction. Aiaz left her American and Chinese bank accounts untouched, both her and Melissa's passports were left behind in the apartment, and neither of them is known to have entered China since their disappearances.  


Investigators believe the motive for Aiaz and Melissa's abductions may have something to do with Aiaz's past. She had told Zhang she was a wealthy woman with millions of dollars in investments and hundreds of thousands in cash, and he was shocked to find out after her abduction that this was untrue. It's possible she had upset someone by deceiving them about her money, or that the kidnappers abducted her and her daughter expecting her to pay them money she did not possess.  


Authorities are investigating the cases as possible kidnappings. They remain unsolved.

Convicted murderer Richard Matt who escaped a New York prison with another inmate, sparking a nationwide manhunt before he was shot dead in 2015, may have killed a young mother more than two decades earlier, new court papers allege.
David Sweat, who broke out of the Clinton Correctional Facility with Matt seven years ago, wrote in an affidavit that his friend told him he was behind the brutal strangulation and stabbing death of Buffalo housewife Deborah Meindl in 1993.


The onetime cellmates, both convicted murderers, famously used tools smuggled in by their married lover, then-prison worker Joyce Mitchell, to carve through a wall to freedom, setting off a 23-day manhunt. 
The daring jailbreak that ended with a federal agent fatally shooting Matt and Sweat’s recapture near the Canadian border captivated the nation and inspired the TV series ""Escape at Dannemora"" starring Benicio del Toro and Patricia Arquette.

Sweat’s new claim of Matt’s role in the Meindl murder was made during an Oct. 18 interview with attorneys for two Buffalo men – James Pugh and Brian Lorenzo -- who say they were framed for the woman’s slaying and are trying to get their trial convictions thrown out.
 
""Matt used a tie to strangle the victim,"" Sweat wrote in the affidavit, more than half of which was redacted. ""While Matt strangled the victim with the tie, Matt interrogated her about whether she had told anyone else what she knew about the officer."" 
He said his slain pal told him he had killed 33-year-old Meindl, a nursing student, at the behest of a corrupt cop.

Attorneys Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, who represents Pugh, and Ilann Maazel, who represents Lorenzo, say the hit may have been ordered by retired Tonawanda Police Department Det. David Bentley, who feared Meindl, his alleged mistress, was about to turn him in for unspecified crimes, court papers allege.
Two Erie County prosecutors who were assigned earlier this year to re-investigate the case against Pugh and Lorenzo allegedly came to believe that Matt and Bentley were the true killers, court papers allege. The DA’s office subsequently turned over critical information supporting this claim to the defense to comply with laws that require disclosure of exculpatory information, according to the filings.


Erie County District Attorney John Flynn disagreed with the prosecutors’ findings and took them off the case because they ""did not accept my decision with the professionalism expected of career prosecutors,"" he said in a statement to Fox News.
 Sweat said that Matt and Bentley went back years and allegedly worked together to rob drug dealers, according to the affidavit.
The attorneys for Pugh and Lorenzo point to what they call another piece of key evidence that casts doubt on their clients’ guilt. The murder weapons were recently tested for DNA, and Pugh and Lorenzo were not a match. But neither was Matt, according to the papers.

During the 1994 trial, prosecutors argued that Pugh and Lorenzo were smalltime burglars who killed Meidl during a botched home invasion. Pugh was recently paroled and Lorenzo is still behind bars.
Meidl was found by her 9-year-old daughter on her return home from school  Feb. 17, 1993. She’d been stabbed numerous times, the tie used to strangle her still wrapped around her neck and her wrists were handcuffed behind her back. Bentley was the lead detective on Meindl’s case.

Flynn said there is no credible evidence to link Richard Matt to the murder of Meindl or that Meindl was having an affair with Bentley. ""Without any new, credible evidence, I will continue to oppose this motion,"" the DA told Fox News in a statement. 
Justice Christopher Burns said Wednesday in Erie County Supreme Court that he wanted to review the papers from both parties and would either vacate the convictions or hold a hearing on the matter Dec. 13.

662,crime-solver,[],1636117485,"On October 23, 1979, at about 7 pm, first-grader Elizabeth Lynne Barclay was walking with her three-year-old brother Scotty and five-year-old neighbour J.R.  to the convenience store, in the 2900 block of West Northwest Highway near Community in Dallas.

About a block from the children’s North East Dallas apartment, a dark-coloured car, with a trunk lid that wouldn’t close all the way, approached them and stopped next to them.  An African American male got out of the car, grabbed Elizabeth, hit her and forced her into his car.   The male was about 30 to 35 years old, about 5’10”,  stockily built, with long sideburns.  He threatened her screaming:

**""I will drown you.""**

His car was a dark coloured 1974 two-door Buick sedan.

&amp;#x200B;

**SEARCH AND INVESTIGATION**

Police were notified immediately, and a search began for Elizabeth with the aid of a helicopter and horseback riders.  They searched near lake Bachman, as they feared that Elizabeth’s abductor might attempt to drown her. The lake was less than a mile from the girl’s apartment, where she lived with her mother Linda since the parents have been separated.

Investigators searched their files for known sex offenders as well as leads on cars.  They didn’t believe that there was any personal connection between the poor girl and her abductor.  Police stated that the incident happened so quickly and in front of very young witnesses, that detectives were **‘gasping at straws’**.

There was also another witness looking out of his window that witnessed the abduction and stated that the man seemed to be hitting the girl in the back seat of the car while driving away.

**A suspect**, fitting the description of the man, was arrested and questioned four days after the abduction, on an outstanding parking ticket, but police stated that:

‘He was one of many who fitted the general description of the kidnapper and drove a similar car’.

**Another suspect** was arrested in a phone booth after calling the police and asking for $10000  for the safe return of the girl.  Apparently, he had nothing to do with the abduction and was charged with extortion.

&amp;#x200B;

**REMAINS FOUND**

On December 19, 1979, the remains of Elizabeth were sadly found, on the side of a rural road in Van Zandt County in East Texas.  Farmworkers were hauling hay in the Hiram-Willis Point area when they discovered her decomposed body in a ditch.  It was about 45 miles east of Dallas and 3 miles from Interstate 20.

Two .45-caliber cartridges were found near the body. But there were many other cartridges in the area, as it was used for target practice.  The medical examiner stated that she was shot in the chest.  Also, there was a stab wound on her skull.  There were two holes in her blouse, suggesting that she was shot twice.  Some of her bones were scattered across the roadway.  She was identified through dental records the next day, which would have been her 8th birthday.

* There was no mention of whether foreign DNA was found at the crime scene or on her remains.
* The same clothing Elizabeth was wearing on the day of her abduction was found at the scene.
* There was no mention of whether she was killed at that location.
* According to one source, the medical examiner estimated that she was murdered the day after she was kidnapped.

**In 2019** Texas Rangers have reopened the investigation into the abduction and murder of Elizabeth and urge anyone with information to come forward.  The suspect would likely be over 70 years old.

On a final note, I wonder if an artist has ever been commissioned to draw a sketch of the suspect.

664,AT_7997,[],1636086515,"I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to be saying this on here, but since finding out about this case, it’s been bugging me for a while. 

Me and a couple of friend were browsing the internet a few years ago, and we ended up down a rabbit hole of messed up and morbid sites (your typical sites like best gore etc). We saw a lot of disturbing videos but we were kinda expecting to, we didn’t think much of it. 

So recently I watched an iceberg video about hoaxes and the Andreas Bauminis case was shown on there, they described the video that he was in possession of. As I was listening to the description, it gave me chills. One of the videos that we stumbled across was an almost perfect copy of the video described. I don’t want to go too much into detail, but the man decorating and the girl asking for money is very specific, and this is exactly what was in the video that we saw as well as other stuff.

Could we have watched the infamous video that people have been speculating about? It’s really worrying me that I may have watched something illegal, thinking it was just acting.

I promise you that I’m being 100% serious with this post. If anybody wants more details on what I remember from the video, message me privately as I don’t want to say anything on here that could get me in trouble. 

I also wanna clarify that we didn’t go specifically looking for this video, we merely accidentally stumbled across it and then never saw it again.

Here’s a link to the YouTube iceberg video that talked about the case, it’s the last one in the video:

665,Persimmonpluot,[],1636085521,"I recently discovered this case and have been thinking a great deal about this man. Police have released very little information leading me to believe they may have a suspect or a working theory and they are building a case. It's a very mysterious and frightening case, especially considering the circumstances and the fact he lived a low risk lifestyle. I really have not developed a theory on his abduction and murder, but I'm very curious to see what others think. 


*Background*

October 21, 2020 started off quite routinely for 55 year old Dallas resident, James Alan White, who went by his middle name. He and his husband Rusty Jenkins were up well before sunrise and headed to their respective gyms as they did most mornings. They were a regimented pair and each expected to see the other back home by about 6:00 a.m. Rusty returned, but Alan did not. By 6:15 a.m., Rusty began calling and texting Alan, but all went unanswered. When Alan missed a 7:00 a.m. conference call, Rusty drove around and searched the streets and phoned hospitals. By 11:00 a.m., Rusty had filed a missing person's report but it would be a week before he received any news. 


Alan, an executive with the global accounting and consulting firm, KPMG was also hosting his niece and her fiancee who were in town for a few days to finalize wedding plans. Family and friends said Alan had been excitedly looking forward to his niece's visit and had planned out an itinerary  for their entire stay. They had just arrived the night before. This detail seems key in that I think a person would be less likely to break from routine with a houseguest present, especially a younger relative planning a special event. Early on, his niece responded to an online discussion and explained how out of character his disappearance was and to reject the notion that he voluntarily disappeared. She also described how Alan had helped her select a wedding dress several months earlier because Covid kept her mother from flying to Texas to be there with her. Basically, she described a loving uncle who prioritized family and loved helping her with wedding planning.


Rusty and Alan's niece spent the first night of his disappearance  unsuccessfully trying to log into Alan's laptop to track his iPhone. On day two, family arrived in Dallas to assist with the search. Alan was extremely close to his family. He had three siblings, but a fourth had unexpectedly died the previous year, making Alan's disappearance even more difficult for all of them. While his family did what they could, local news stations featured Alan's story and interviewed his husband, brother,  and mother. The local LGBTQ community helped share Alan's story through their independent newspaper and appealed to readers who might have information to come forward. His family offered a $20,000 reward and posted fliers with photos and case details throughout the city. 


*Initial Investigation*

Within days, critical details were established, including Alan's timestamped departure from the gym along with security footage showing him walking alone in the parking lot and safely entering his 2019 Porsche Macan before leaving L.A. Fitness City Place on Haskell Road at 5:39 a.m. Alan was next seen in still images pumping gas at the RaceTrac gas station at Inwood Road and Maple Avenue. Rusty verified that he knew Alan planned to get gas that morning. Several sources questioned his choice of gas stations because it required him to drive an additional 7-8 minutes out of his way when he could have stopped at other stations on a more direct, shorter route home. Records show that the gas was purchased at 6:01 a.m., and at 6:02 Alan entered the station's market but only lingered two minutes then left. Video showed that he then sat in his car for several minutes before driving off but not leaving the property. Instead, he drove through the station's parking lot to another parking area behind the adjacent Church's Chicken eatery. Nobody else was seen in Alan's car and he was not seen speaking to anybody. Finally, he left the lot and turned right on Maple Avenue which he should have followed for about 1.5 miles then turned onto his street. Had he followed this simple route home,  his black Porsche would have appeared on CVS's extensive surveillance system four blocks away but it did not appear in any footage. For unknown reasons, Alan took one of three possible turns before the CVS intersection which led him away from home. 


About a week later, Alan's SUV, which was a dealership loaner he used while his was being repaired was located about 15 miles away from his last known location parked in the 5800 block of Kitty Street. It's been noted that the location is used as a dumping spot.  Furthermore, it appeared that somebody tried to conceal the car between two sets of shrubs. The car was very clean when Alan was last seen driving it, but when recovered it was covered in mud. Some sources say the seats were wet but I also read that was incorrect. Otherwise, the car was in good condition. Several sources noted that it rained the day after Alan's disappearance so it seems somebody drove the car after he vanished. His Iphone was found inside the car but his niece said the Sim card must have been removed. Although she did not divulge details, she seemed to indicate that Alan's phone stopped working during the first hour he went missing. The gym bag he left the house with was not in the car. Several people discussing the case online stated they had the same car and that it is equipped with a tracking system and reasoned that any expensive loaner vehicle would definitely be easily traceable but strangely his wasn't. Additionally, it was noted that the car should have provided details about where it traveled, when it stopped and for how long, and even when and which doors were opened. Likewise, its blue tooth should have shown details of any new phones that may have entered the car and connected. Apparently, none of this exists.



*Post Car Recovery Investigation*

After his car was found, police reclassified Alan's case from a ""want to locate"" to one identified as ""endangered and missing"".  Police obtained warrants for Alan's electronic devices. His family, friends, and witnesses were interviewed. As days turn to months, police released no updates or information. In late December, Rusty sold their house for about $2,000,000. Though not verified, I found rumors that Rusty could not maintain the home on his income alone. Some people have questioned the legalities of selling a jointly owned home so quickly, but Alan's family explained that the couple had taken legal steps to protect each other in the event of something unforeseen occuring. The couple also owned a home in Cape Cod that I found no record of having been sold. It had been a vacation home and where they planned to live after retirement. Police released a statement around this time claiming they were still awaiting warrants and information to return from an outside crime lab. 


On May 13, 2021, a surveyor working for Paul Quinn College located Alan's remains in a wooded area just north of the campus. The location is about a mile from where the Porsche was found. Some sources claim he was buried in a shallow grave but police are very tight lipped about the investigation so I cannot confirm that. To date, no COD has been revealed. Police reclassified the case to a homicide investigation. No details about the condition of the body or if additional items were located were ever released. One source noted that police cordoned off the area and brought in a large number of officers to perform a very thorough search. Findings were not released. Alan was buried in his family's plot in West Virginia.


*Some Theories*

I've read a lot of speculation about what might have happened to Alan, but currently there is no evidence that supports any of the claims. I don't know the Dallas area but much speculation is based on his choice of gas stations. Besides being out of the way it's also described as being located in a sketchy neighborhood but that doesn't mean much to me. I don't have a fixed gas station location and I definitely stop in areas people might describe as sketchy. I also have friends in those areas so I don't find it really important but what do I know? 


The following theories are pure speculation posted online and being provided for discussion purposes but not necessarily supported by me.
One theory is that Alan was involved in a drug deal that went bad. Nothing suggests that Alan was a drug user. This idea materialized because of where he purchased gas. Unless there's insider information I haven't read anything that would support this idea. 


A second theory is that Alan planned a quick hookup that turned deadly. Although this idea seems plausible because people do stray, it seems odd that Alan would arrange a hook-up on the morning of an important work call with his niece also visiting. The timing is way off. Yet, he did linger in and around the gas station as if he might be waiting on someone. He could have been texting or making a call, but why not do it from home? Although no details have been released, Alan's niece said that his phone's final activity occured at 6:30 a.m. in the form of a received text. She did not disclose the sender's identity and it could likely have been his husband. 


A final theory I saw repeated was that  his husband was responsible. We know it happens all too often, but Rusty had a solid alibi and the couple had no known issues or any history of of a troubled relationship. Some people suggested Rusty could have  hired a hitman but no motive is offered. Based purely on statistics, I would favor this theory, but ultimately  it doesn't fit for me. I don't support any of these suspicions. Further complicating this mystery is that Alan's family, friends, and colleagues all describe his as a kind, generous, and hard working man who loved his family and friends. He had a solid marriage, good career, and purportedly didn't have a mean bone in his body. He loved life and doted on his dog, Zoe. Who could have murdered him? 


*A Few Questions*

Alan was known to be very routine, so was there any significance to switching up gas stations? 


Why did he turn away from his drive home? What could he possibly have been doing at 6:00 a.m.?


Does any evidence suggest he was robbed? Was his wallet located? 
Are there any similar crimes that occurred in Dallas? 


How likely is it that somebody would carjack and murder Alan just to drive 15 miles across town and leave the car? Or, use it a few days then ditch it?


How was the car located? Are there cameras in that area?  


What do phone records reveal? Did Alan and Rusty have an open relationship?  If so, would it be reasonable to think he planned a meeting or hook-up for such a short period of time?  


Why didn't the police seemed concerned about the public if there's a murderer on the loose?

666,WeathersRabbits,[],1636076842," This is part two of a two-part series post!

**Moon Valley Road** 

386 Moon Valley Road, Lebanon, Missouri 65536. Sometimes listed as Windyville, Missouri, or Buffalo, Missouri. Trulia says the home does have a basement. It is a single-family home with one bath. 800 sqft of floor space built-in 1993-96. It sits on about 3 acres of land. The area is heavily wooded. Nearby there is a Missouri conservation access to the Niangua River. It includes a boat ramp and parking lot. https://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/places/moon-valley-access 

Visually it had at least three structures on the property. The main house and a small shed/shacks. Dog houses, three vans, personal debris like barrels are also left. There were cage-like objects that could be seen, but they could be dog cages or stock tank holders. The was a large hanging chain with an industrial hook at once, but that could have been used for trucks or deer/pig processing. The history of this property is complicated. Some news sources say that James Phelps owned the property, and some will say he rented the property. James Phelps listed the property as his home in 2011. Norton listed it as his address in 1992 and 1993. 

However, other court documents say Norton lived in Wright City in 2020. In 2015 a registered sex offender listed his address as 386 Moon Valley, but he has a newer record with a more recent address listed elsewhere. To find the records yourself, check the SCSO offender's list and then look up the Missouri State Highway Patrol Sex offender Registry with any proper names you find on the DCSO offender's list. Ozarksfirst News spoke with a man who said he built the cabin. This man also claimed he owned the property. However, records prove that he did not. Ozarksfirst news spoke with the property owner indicated by records. This person was aware of the cabin on the property was not sure if it was legally his. There is also a man that claimed he owned the property, and this was listed in 1997. The online records show that the property was owned by a man from southwest Missouri since 2009. 

**Area Location**

The location is hard to pin down because of the vast expanse and several names. This area can be lumped together as Lebanon, Dallas County, Windyville, Bennet Springs, Buffalo, and Moon Valley. They are, however, different locations on the map. Springfield, Mo, is also close by and sometimes lumped in. That is about one hour from 386 Moon Valley. 

**Lebanon, Missouri,** is a city in Laclede County. The population was 14,474 in the 2010 census. According to neighborhoodscout.com, Lebanon has a crime rate of 52 per one thousand residents. This is roughly 20 mins from the 386 Moon Valley address. 

*""Lebanon has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 19. Within Missouri, more than 91% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Lebanon. ""* 

Violent crime, property crime, and vehicle theft are high by stats. Word of mouth is that the area is poverty-stricken. According to datausa.io Lebanon, has a 20.4% poverty status out of the 14.3k people. Word of mouth reputation is that Lebanon is has a drug problem. Meth, opioids, and oxy. According to vertavahealth.com, Lebanon has experienced trends in drugs or excessive drinking. 16% of adults report binge drinking. 2016 had 108.6 opioid prescriptions.

**James D. Phelps**

 A female neighbor described Phelps as into the seedy side of things. Via social media, people tell their tales of encounters with Phelps, and most conclude he was creepy. Online there is very little information about Phelps, except for this link showing that he was ordained.

*https://amp.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article254984327.html* 

One of the primary sources for the cannibalism rumors returns to an online blogger. *""The Crime Scene,""* written by KB who focuses on crime in and around southwest Missouri. An article was posted on September 30th, 2021, about Cassidy Rainwater. It was the first post since September 17th, 2015. KB has a natural talent for writing, and her blog has several accolades. KB is clear and upfront that some of her information is based on rumors. The blogger has several sources that all wish to remain anonymous. The first source was someone allegedly close to the investigations. The source of the anonymous person seems to have come from Reddit. On Facebook, KB put out a post looking for tips, and in the conversation, they post some messages sent via Reddit. These conversations can be found under the #cassidyrainwater tag via Facebook. 

The first source said the FBI used software that used pixels and matched skintones on the anonymous photo. This system made a possible match to Rainwater. Then they forwarded that info to the Dallas County Sheriff. (News sources say the photo was turned in by a person who told the FBI they thought the person pictured was a woman named CR.) This person also said that during the first interview with James Phelps, he was ""acting weird."" The source said they walked to the back and saw meathooks in the bathroom window. This is allegedly what prompted law enforcement to get a search warrant. The following morning they kicked in the door and found Phelps eating a sandwich made with human remains. Then Phelps laughed and told investigators he served human ribs to an unsuspecting neighbor a few days prior. The search allegedly found vacuum-sealed body parts with detailed labels in a freezer. They speculated that Norton may have helped transport victims across state lines. (According to LE and news sources using court documents.

James Phelps had an initial interview with DCSO's Sgt. RS at Phelp's home on August 25th or September 1st, 2021. Investigators saw his property and the loft space inside the cabin. Sgt R.S. was forwarded information from the FBI on September 16th, 2021. That is what prompted the arrest of James Phelps that same day.) Another anonymous source stated that LE could be interested in a second property. The property location was near Preston, MO. This property was supposed to belong to a Phelps family member. (No secondary properties or people were named in the news.) Another anonymous source stated that LE found human remains in some trailer tanks on the property. Another source said that at least one set of partial remains had been recovered so far at Phelp's property, and there could be 13 other sets of remains. (DCSO Sherrif did deny that 18 sets of bodies were found publicly in the news) The blog reported on the speculation from Reddit about the vans. They said a van was recovered on the Phelps property connected to the infamous Springfield 3 case. They also mention Echo M. Lloyde's case. (All three visible vans on Phelp's property are still there even after the fire and scene release from DCSO.) 

Ifunny *""Meme""* Outside of Reddit, Facebook, and KB's blog, another outside source mentions cannibals. This is a post made on iFunny about the situation, and the user name was Addict\_the\_3rd. They made the post 27 days ago from 10/29/21 to put it around October 3rd, 2021. This dates the post after *""The Crime Scene""'s initial blog post.""* 

https://ifunny.co/user/Addict\_the\_3rd and https://ifunny.co/picture/wreg-com-men-accused-of-keeping-missing-woman-locked-in-eVTvxDIy8 

Sometimes the link will not work. You can get to the link by googling *""James D. Phelps Meathooks""* it is the top link. 

**Tiktok**

Tiktok has a hand in spreading cannibal speculation, starting with a few crimetok posts that went viral with misinformation. Several people have stated that if it were not for these videos, they would not have known about the case. 

**Documenting Rumors**

*This section is for documenting rumors and hearsay. The purpose is to gather publicly available information for the sake of data. Most of the rumors come from Reddit and Facebook. Sometimes comment sections under content. I apologize if I missed anything. There was a lot. This section does not accuse anyone of anything, and this* **section has a content warning.** 

**The Body In Tree:** This rumor has a few versions and is tied with cannibal speculation. People either saw themselves or heard from others about a body or bodies found hanging from the trees. Sometimes the body is skinned or prepared like a deer. Sometimes, the body is Rainwater, and sometimes it is multiple random victims. Some point to the sizeable hanging chain with an industrial pulling hook in the photos to prove these rumors. 

**Potluck Rumors:** This rumor is based on the origins of Phelps eating a sandwich of human meats. The rumor on human meats in the freezers or van on the property and other similar variants. People claim they have themselves or heard of people who were sold or given meat from Phelps/Norton. This meat, of course, is allegedly human. There are other variants of people going to BBQs and potlucks where Phelps/Norton attended. (In other accounts, people described the pair as creepy and how they avoided them at all costs) The Darkweb: This rumor has a few versions and also has ties to cannibal speculation. People say the photo turned into FBI was from the dark web. Sometimes, it is said from cannibal rings, cannibal cults,s or human meat butcher forums/groups.

**Spinoff theory:** The cannibal cult, ring, butchers are local and live in the area. Sometimes, a local Meaphysics store is a part of it or even the LE. (One single news source refers to the original photo as a dark web photo. CBS17 News.) The Metaphysics School: The rumor seems to have started on Reddit. Some point out suspicious book titles as proof of their involvement in a cannibal cult. Some are just pointing out their proxy to Moon Vally Rd. Serial Killer: This rumor mixes a little with theory. The rumors, however, speculate the duo could have been doing their work for 16-30+ years. The idea that they are serial killers connected to old cases seems to be because of the three old vans on their property. There was talk that one of the vans was supposed to be recovered for forensics or in another version of one of the freezers. (No murder charges have been filed. The vans and freezers were left even after property release by SCSO. SCSO Sherrif addressed the rumor about 18 sets of remains being false.) https://www.kansascity.com/article254984327.html 

**Rainwater Confirmed Deceased By Family:** The family's rumor on social media about Rainwater's death. The idea is supported by circulated screenshots mentioning her passing. These are supposed to be from family, but the screenshots do not show names nor date/time stamps. These screenshots do beg for privacy about the situation. (Rainwater is still listed as a Missing Person, LE said when they seized Phelps phone, she had not been located. They are testing some DNA samples but have not stated results) More Than Two: Rumor mixed with a bit of theory. The lack of information on LE's part brought them to light with scrutiny. Not knowing if the scene was protected, who, or what was found has caused people to say they were involved. The FBI involvement did not help but added fuel to the distrust. Besides, police people have suggested a particular sex offender was involved, other serial killers who were prolific, gangs related to drugs, and more. The criminal fire solidified these claims in the minds of a few online. Fired LE: A slight variant in rumor said online that two police officers were fired for leaking information. Some feel that this proves the rumors. (The lead investigators are Dallas County Sherrif Office. They have had FBI assistance and some Police, but they were not leads but leading help) FBI. Takeover: A few claims/misheard online users thought the FBI took the case over. (However, the investigating agency is listed as DCSO, and the FBI has been thanked publicly for their assistance, but they are not the leads.) 

**Stalking:** Allegedly, public people have been stalking or harassing anyone involved in the case—even distant family members. A rumor story is that a Phelps distant family member was run off the road and their child injured. The incident allegedly sparked DCSO's anger. (Unable to find evidence for the story, but Sherrif rants about the rumors on DCSO's Facebook.) 

**More Than One Crimecene:** This rumor mixed with a bit of theory starts on Facebook, Reddit, and *""The Crime Scene""* blog. Some online say they say SCSO is investigating nearby properties allegedly owned by Phelps/Norton. Some say they heard they would search secondary properties. Bennet Springs, Various locations near Moon Valley, Preston Mo, The Vans and Freezers, Metaphysics school, and more have been rumored. 

**Theories**

This section is for compiling ideas, connections, brainstorms about the case. Nothing in this section is a fact. The collective ideas come from different public places—Reddit, Facebook, and similar. The content warning still applies. 

**Truck Driver:** Norton's self-described job title opens up the possibility of a crime taking place across state lines. The FBI involvement seems to make people agree that this theory could have some backing. Serial Killers: There are very few facts yet to back this idea. However, there are some tiny indicators that this case could be more significant than just Rainwater. People are hopeful that their loved one's case could be solved. 

**Mother Connection:** A variant of serial killers or more than two is the theory Rainwater's case somehow connects to her mother's death. The idea is targeted harassment from Phelps/Norton and targets for gangs in general or somehow connected with drugs/human trafficking rings. People look at Rainwater's mother's boyfriend as a suspect, but he is deceased now. 

**Rainwater Deceased:** This theory is based on the fact they are charging Phelps/Norton with kidnapping, terrorizing, and intent to injure. The LE has clearly stated they hope to add more charges later, and they are waiting on DNA results. So, the theory is that they intend to prove Rainwater's death even if her body is not located. 

**Rainwater Alive/Trafficking:** This theory is based on the fact that Rainwater has not been located. They are leaving room for hope that she is alive. The theory is that perhaps she was human trafficked. Norton being a trucker, their home being close to the river and highway gives some backing to the idea. The highway and area are near known trafficking routes. Some spinoff theories on this idea, building either on trafficking or hopeful Rainwater escaped and will not come out of hiding.

https://www.417mag.com/issues/january-2018/human-trafficking-on-i-44/ 

**More Than Two:** Theory mixed with rumors. There are many variants of this thought. A third party besides Phelps and Norton was involved with either a larger option ratio or Rainwater. Some say gangs, cults, clubs, or just one other man. Some distrusting LE has suggested them. Backing the theory is the possible third man who used Moon Valley Rd. as an address in 2015. The secretive behavior of the authorities involved/their alleged lack of interest in the case. Lastly, the burning of the Phelps property was ruled as criminal arson. 

**Possible Connected Cases**

This case is on the verge of knowing if more cases could be connected. When more information is released, more connections can be made. The only connection I felt I could add now is this one encounter. Please, keep in mind that connections are possibilities but not facts. 

Youtuber SC encountered a partially nude woman near moon valley road. The incident occurs on July 14th, 2021. SC explains that river floats and camping happen all the time near his property. Drunkenness is a reasonably common occurrence. This encounter starts with SC hearing panicked women screaming for help repeatedly. SC records investigate and attempt to get information from her without putting himself in harm's way. In the video, the woman is wearing little clothing and is rinsing off or doing something in the river. When SC attempts to find out what is wrong, the woman moves out of his view but continues to yell for help—only stopping to say that her husband had hit her and hurt her. Without cell service, SC must trek to the top of the hill to call the police. Once at the top of the hill, the situation worsens. SC notices an all-black pickup truck that was parked on his hard-to-find backwood private property. When they saw him, they left. There was another van there as well. The woman vanishes, and they suspect somehow she was found and picked up. Then SC and his group encounter a man from the river, and they have a long awkward conversation about the woman. The man implies he was trying to help her, and he becomes defensive, refusing to give his last name.

**Polarized Community** 

The arrest and announcement of Phelps/Norton rocked the community. Some come to defend him and say innocent until proven guilty, and others come to condemn him and mount even more claims. 

**Authorities Tight-Lipped** 

In contrast to the speculation from the community, authorities are tight-lipped DCSO will not return calls to news-press. They will not confirm information, and they have made a scathing post about online speculation. Fire departments, the bomb squad, and even the 911 dispatcher will not release any statements.

**Conclusion**

Cassidy Rainwater's case is still unsolved. James Phelps and Timothy Phelps await preliminary hearings. If you have any information, please contact DCSO. https://dcsomo.com/

**The Disappearance of Russell Hill and Carol Clay**

**Background**

*""There was a stage where it was named the most isolated cattle property in the Southern Hemisphere,""*

- Lachlan Cullican, local resident [1]

Wonnangatta Valley, a remote area of bushland located in the remote East Gippsland, is a 1.6 million square enclave of dense scrub, and mountainous ranges - and the oft-repeated tales of ghosts, murders, and mystery, shroud the area in a macabre light. Situated 350 kilometres east of Melbourne, this particular stretch of land is an assuming and oft-forgotten valley, situated between the popular ski resorts of Mount Hotham and Mount Buller. The extreme remoteness of the location, coupled with the unforgiving nature of the Australian country, means only experienced hunters, hikers and bush rovers are suited to make the potentially perilous venture in. Parks Victoria, the bureaucratic department that maintains and services the area encompassing Wonnangatta, lists the park tracks as ‘Very difficult, owing to the rocky, steep inclines, rugged bush, and sodden clay descents.’ [1]

But beneath the mysterious exterior of Wonnangatta lies a dark interior, one that has seen four people disappear within a 60km radius of the area between 2019-2020 alone. 

Russell Hill (74) and Carol Clay (73), who both reside in the state of Victoria, decided to take a camping trip to Wonnangatta Valley. Russell, a married man of over 50 years to Robyn with two adult daughters, Colleen and Debbie, is an experienced bushman who had been a frequent visitor to the remote parts of Victoria’s High Country. Carol, a long-time friend of Russell’s, is the former leader of the Victorian Country Women’s Association, had accompanied Russell in the past on some of his various camping expeditions. 
 This also wasn’t Russell’s first trip in to the area either – having visited the area at least three times in the month before he disappeared. 

On March 19th, 2020, Russell left his home in the suburb of Drouin and picked Carol up from her house in Pakenham, a satellite suburb located 53km south east of Melbourne City. Driving his white Toyota Landcruiser, the pair set off for the 360km journey towards Wonnangatta Valley in the Victorian Alps. Russell had informed Family and friends (who weren’t aware at the time of Carroll’s presence on the camping trip) that he would be camping at Wonnangatta River, situated near the Wonnangatta camping ground. Russell had informed them he expected to be returning on either March the 27th or 28th. 
The pair spent the first night in Howitt High Plains – a two and a half hour, seventy-kilometre drive from Wonnangatta Camping Ground. Mobile tracking data revealed the pair drove through Heyfield, Licola, and Licola North to get to Wonnangatta Valley. Upon arriving, they then took the Zeka Spur Track, which leads up in to the Victorian High Country of Wonnangatta. Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper noted this was ‘getting close to as remote as you can get in Victoria.’ 


**The Investigation**

""It's something that's been pre-planned, premeditated. What that raises is why would someone premeditate such a vile act on two people who were intelligent, responsible and prepared?""
On March 20th, a full day after having arrived, Russell made contact with his wife Robyn via a high-frequency phone, informing her he was at Wonnangatta Valley; this is now understood to have been the last confirmed communications Russell made with his family before his disappearance.  
On the 21st of March at 2pm, a passer-by walking in the area discovered a perturbing site; Russell’s Toyota Landcruiser, which was noted as having sustained some minor damage, was abandoned next to his now burnt-down campsite. After surveying the confusing site, the campers decided to alert police to the scene. Inspector Craig Gaffee of the Victorian Police Service noted the pair’s campsite was well-equipped, with thousands of dollars’ worth of high-quality camping gear strewn about – but curiously, both the $2,000 drone Russell had brought camping, and the pairs sleeping bags, were nowhere to be seen. Much of the camp site was destroyed by what appears to be a suspicious fire and in the ashes were unusual items such as a drum, seats and gas bottle. [4]
“My belief is they are still in that broad area,”
Police have conducted an extensive search of the Wonnangatta Valley and surrounding area, with detectives from the Missing Persons Squad, the search and rescue squad, air wing, dog squad, local police and the Australian Federal Police. Detectives still believe the bodies of Russell and Carol are located within the 1.6 million square miles of hectare that encompasses Wonnangatta Valley. [5]
Compounding the already mysterious circumstances is the fact that a number of murders and disappearances have haunted police over the past few years. A notable example includes David Prideux, a former Barwon Prison Officer and passionate bush hunter. David disappeared on June 5, 2011 after taking his brother-in-law deer hunting in Alpine National Park. Despite several police-led searches, David nor his brother-in-law have been seen or heard from since. 

A long-time friend of Russell’s, Robbie Ashlin, is the last known person to have made direct contact. Both men are part of an amateur radio club, whose members are involved in various outdoor pursuits including hunting, camping and fishing – with the main form of communication between members being through radio receivers. At 6:00 pm each day, Russell would call in to the radio club to communicate either his days adventures or to chat generally about his and the other members various pursuits and hobbies. When Robbie noticed Russell hadn’t made his usual 6:00 pm call he wasn’t overly concerned, but by the 23rd, Robbie reported him missing to the authorities. [2]
Despite ongoing searches and inquiries by police, records indicate that neither Russell nor Carol have accessed their phones, credit cards, or bank accounts. Detective Andrew Stamper noted that Police had a small number of people on their suspect list, with particular focus pointed towards the driver of a white utility vehicle spotted near the public toilets in the valley a day before the couple made their final contact with friends. 

**Theories, Suspects and Updates**

“Despite being described as 'spooky' and 'bloody scary', police have no evidence to suggest he was involved in any disappearances and there have been no reports of violence.”
One of the first and most prevalent theories regarding their disappearance was Russell and Carol had run off together after engaging in a secret affair for the better part of 20 years. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Russell hadn’t informed any family or friends that he was going on the trip with Carol. [1] Whilst no theories have been posited yet with any smoking gun evidence of a secret affair between the two, but interestingly, it is noted that the pair had been possible high school sweethearts. Carol had also attended Russell’s wedding to wife Robyn. 
Further twisting the case is the appearance of a person simply known as ‘the button man’. Campers and hunters alike have stories of the ‘button man’, ranging from generally benign encounters and sightings, to more campfire ghost story type tales. While most reports say he generally questions people on what they’re doing in the Valley, he avoids any questions relating to his personal life. A more sinister tale involves a wildlife photographer who was in the Wonnangatta Valley area taking shots for an upcoming project. After a few days of photography and wilderness exploration, he packed up and headed back home. After downloading the photos to his computer, he was baffled to find there was one unexplained shot; it was a night time photo of the wildlife photographer sleeping inside his tent – made even more peculiar due to the fact he went on the trip alone. Another storied encounter comes from an experienced bush hunter who, while camping alone in the Valley, awoke around 11pm one night to find Button Man camped next to him. [1] 
 Once considered to be nothing more than an urban legend, the button man is a bush-savvy expert bushman who earned his moniker due to the deer antlers he utilises to make buttons and fashion plug-style ear rings. [1] He is described as being aged in his 70s, with short grey hair and a fondness for wearing dark jackets, and an affinity for building strange rock pyramids around the Valley. In spite of his old age and the difficulties that brings when trying to navigate rough terrain, they say he moves through even the toughest territory with the competence and stamina of someone half his age. Apart from being described as ‘bloody scary’ or just ‘spooky’, no one has reported any threats or violence. 

Police, who were aware of the tales and legends surrounding the button man much before the disappearances happened, hiked in to a remote area near King Billy Track to question him in regards to anything he may have witnessed. Occupying a camp on the side of a remote mountain, he has full access of anyone approaching, and utilises snares and spears to compliment his hunting. He isn’t considered a suspect or person of interest, with police later stating they sought his help due to his wealth of knowledge and experience within the Wonnangatta Valley. [1] After speaking to police, they found he had no knowledge of the couple. 
“The strongest theory we have is sadly that there was a third-party intervention, there were other people involved,” – Detective Andrew Stamper [3]
Officially, Police are leading with the theory that the pair were set upon by unknown attackers, and announced in April 2021 that the forensic investigation unit had found two shovels while searching the Mt Hotham region. Initially suspected to have been used in the commission of a crime, later testing revealed the shovels aren’t forensically linked to the disappearances. [4] 

Victorian Police continue the search for Russell and Carol, and are still publicly appealing for any information pertaining to the whereabouts of both.

668,Personal-Proposal-91,[],1636063669,"The Seattle Police Department is searching for the person or persons who may have set fire to the lumberyard Blackstock Lumber Company in Seattle on September 9, 1989. This unidentified arsonist has been connected to over twenty fires in and around Seattle. The Blackstock Lumber fire occurred around 10pm; twenty fire trucks responded to the four-alarm blaze. When the first truck arrived, the fire appeared to be controllable. However, the fire soon spread to other parts of the lumberyard and became one of the biggest fires in recent Seattle history.

  
Thirty-two-year-old Matt Johnson and his partner Bill Meredith were two of the first firefighters inside the building. The roof had exploded while they were inside; both Matt and Bill were overcome by an intense heat. The lack of oxygen and intense heat left Matt unable to move. Bill became lost and disoriented in the fire but was eventually able to escape. Tragically, Matt's body was found in the rubble the next day. Matt left behind a wife and a fifteen-month-old son.

  
At first, fire investigators assumed that the fire had been started accidentally by a vagrant that was trying to keep warm. Investigator Dennis Fowler, however, discovered a pattern in the ruins that matched the signature of a serial arsonist that he had been tracking for years. Fowler first encountered the arsonist in 1984 when Seattle's Carpet Exchange Warehouse burned down in less than twenty minutes. The fire was so intense that it melted concrete and warped steel beams.  
After the Blackstock lumberyard fire, the Seattle Fire Department began investigating on a national scale. They found at least twenty other fires in both the United States and Canada that seemed to be started by the same individual, known as the ""King of Arsonists"". The fires set by this arsonist were especially dangerous because the oxygen in their water only made the fire burn faster and hotter. One factor that made the arsonist difficult to track was that he used a fuel of unknown origin; an accelerant that left behind no residue, called a ""high temperature accelerant"" or HTA. It generated temperatures between 5000 and 7000 degrees, three times hotter than a normal fire.

  
A series of tests were done with various types of fuels in order to determine which one the arsonist used. On March 25, 1990, the Seattle Fire Department set a test fire in an empty shopping center; the entire complex was destroyed within minutes. The fire helped narrow down the types of fuel that the arsonist used. The fuel, which the Seattle Fire Department has kept secret, was a mixture of several common ingredients that were readily available. However, only someone with a specific knowledge of chemistry would know how to put all of the ingredients together. Fowler believes that the arsonist actually hires other people to set the fires.

  
The only fire that produced eyewitnesses was the Blackstock lumberyard fire. One eyewitness had read about the fire in the newspaper and realized that he had been in the area about fifteen minutes prior to when the alarm was called in. He was driving along the road of the lumberyard when he noticed a 1970s or 1980s Mercedes coming out of a parking lot at the lumberyard. He felt that this was unusual because of the time of night.

  
Another eyewitness claimed that she saw a suspicious man after the fire was set. While the crowds were looking at the fire in progress, the man was apparently walking away from the area, paying no attention to the large fire nearby. She felt that the man's actions were suspicious. Investigators believe that the man was the arsonist and that he had set the fire and waited until crowds gathered before he walked away from the scene.

  
Under hypnosis, the two eyewitnesses described two different men; both are not considered suspects, but police would like to question them. The man driving the Mercedes was between thirty-five and forty years old (in 1992), with gray hair, mustache, beard, and receding hairline. The man seen leaving the fire was 6'0"", well-dressed, in his early or mid thirties (in 1992), with an athletic build, dark complexion, and dark hair.

  
The arson fires have claimed the lives of at least two firefighters, Matt Johnson and Paul Heidenreich, who died in a 1982 warehouse fire. The fires have taken place in Spokane, Yakima, Seattle, and Bellingham, as well as in California, Florida, and British Columbia. Authorities are currently investigating suspicious insurance claims for fires across the nation for connections to the arsonist.

&amp;#x200B;

 In 1993, [Paul Keller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kenneth_Keller) was arrested for several arson fires in Seattle. Originally, he was thought to be the arsonist. At his trial, he admitted to setting one of the fires attributed to the ""King of Arsonists"". However, the fires that he set usually used gasoline and were not as sophisticated as the ones allegedly set by the arsonist. He also did not match either of the sketches of the suspects.

  
In February 1993, Seattle police announced that they were looking for two men who they wanted to question regarding the Blackstock lumberyard fire. The men were identified after tips came in regarding the sketches of possible suspects in the case. One man was from Illinois and had a criminal history that included being hired as a professional arsonist. The other man, who was reportedly seen driving away from the lumberyard before the fire was reported, was believed to be from the Seattle area. It is not known if the men were ever located or questioned.

  
In February 1995, a new investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms into the Blackstock lumberyard fire determined that it was an accident. Investigators concluded that ""high temperature accelerants"" were not the cause. Instead, they determined that transients most likely started the fire accidentally while trying to keep warm. Lumber and chemicals stored at the facility then caused the fire to reach such high temperatures. Finally, a 440-volt electrical line still connected to a live power panel is believed to have helped spread the fire and cause sparks and ""pyrotechnics"" seen by witnesses. The Seattle Police Department changed the cause of the fire to ""undetermined"".  
ATF investigator Steve Carmen released a report about HTAs. He reviewed the fire that Fowler and his team set at the shopping center and determined that it did not even reach the temperatures that allegedly occurred during the previous HTA arson fires. The shopping center also was not destroyed by the fire, as Fowler had claimed. He also determined that many of the fires that were believed to have been caused by HTAs were not caused by them; instead, either standard accelerants were used or the fires were accidents. However, authorities have yet to close all of the cases allegedly linked to the ""King of Arsonists"".

  
Fowler passed away in 2016 at the age of seventy-six.

In 1996, Terence Paquette was brutally stabbed to death inside the Orange County convenience store where he worked.


ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — The man investigators say brutally murdered another person 25 years ago has finally been caught thanks to DNA found on several beer cans, the Orange County Sheriff's Office says. 
The murder happened on Feb. 3, 1996. Terence Paquette, 31, was stabbed 73 times and his throat was slit inside the bathroom of the convenience store where he worked. The cash register had been emptied. 
Orange County Sheriff John Mina says two samples of blood were found at the ""gruesome"" crime scene, but at the time investigators never found a match.
Eventually, Paquette's case went cold. In 2003, the case was reopened and DNA was entered into CODIS, the FBI's Combined DNA Index System. No match was found. 
That is, until 2021. Back in 2019, a cold case unit was formed. These investigators are solely dedicated to solving cold cases and Mina says to date they have solved eight murders, the oldest case dating back to 1984. 

That same year, investigators began looking into Paquette's murder. 
Investigators say they received help from an FDLE Forensic Genetic Geneology Specialist to solve the case. 
The FDLE used the DNA sample from blood found on a freezer handle at the convenience store and utilized genealogical methods to narrow the search to three brothers, the sheriff's office said.
Eventually, investigators say they narrowed their search to Kenneth Stough, Jr. He was known to frequent the convenience store where Paquette worked and at one point even worked there, according to investigators. 

 At the time of the murder, Stough lived right across the street from Paquette. Stough still lives in Central Florida.
Investigators say they followed Stough to a gas station and saw him throw away several beer cans. They were able to take the DNA from those cans and match it to the DNA found at the crime scene.
Stough is charged with first-degree murder with a weapon, Mina says. Investigators say they do not have a motive yet.
""I think it's important to remind our public again, remind our survivors and the families of all of our victims out there -- we never ever forget about these cases. We continue to work these cases,"" Mina said in part Thursday. 

The sheriff's office says none of Paquette's relatives are still alive, but investigators were able to inform several of his friends an arrest had been made in the case",DNA from beer cans helps solve 25-year-old cold case murder

Victim stabbed 73 times, throat slit in bathroom of Orange County convenience stotre

A Florida man has been arrested in connection to the bloody murder of a convenience store manager who was stabbed 73 times in 1996 after DNA from a discarded beer can linked him to the cold case, investigators said Thursday.

Kenneth Stough Jr., 54, was taken into custody in Lake County on Tuesday more than 25 years after the murder of 31-year-old Terence Paquette, Orange County Sheriff John Mina told reporters at a press conference.

Paquette was found dead on the morning of Feb. 3, 1996, inside the bathroom of the Lil’ Champ convenience store in northwest Orange County. Mina described the scene as ""very gruesome."" 
Paquette had been stabbed 73 times and had his throat slit. Pools of blood stained the floor and walls in photos shown by the sheriff’s office. The cash deposit from the store was also missing.

While homicide detectives working the crime scene in 1996 had discovered the blood of an unknown individual inside the store, Mina said that at the time there was no way to make an arrest based on blood evidence without comparing it to another blood sample and the case went cold.
In 2003, the blood evidence was entered into a database, but no matches were found. The case remained cold until the sheriff’s cold case unit reopened the investigation in 2019.

Using a droplet of the unknown individual’s blood recovered from the handle of a freezer, forensic genealogists with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 2021 determined the blood came from one of three brothers.
Detectives focused on Stough, who they said had worked at the convenience store for some time before Paquette. Detectives also said Stough lived in an apartment across the street from Paquette in 1996 and would often frequent the store.

Detective Brian Savelli monitored Stough and followed him to a Lake County gas station, where he saw Stough throw away several beer cans in a dumpster. Savelli recovered the cans and had them swabbed for DNA. Investigators determined the DNA on the cans matched the DNA found at the crime scene.
Stough was charged with first-degree murder with a weapon. Savelli said detectives were still working to determine a motive.

While none of Paquette’s family was living to receive news of the arrest, detectives informed his friends about the breakthrough in the 25-year-old case.
""I think it’s important to remind our public again, remind our survivors and the families of all our victims out there that we never, ever forget about these cases,"" Minas said.
Since the Orange County Sheriff’s cold case unit was first formed in 2019, the unit has solved eight murders dating back to 1984, Minas said","Florida man arrested after DNA on beer can links him to ‘gruesome’ 1996 cold case murder, investigators say"

A 74-year-old man was arraigned Wednesday on a murder charge in connection with the death of a World War I veteran who disappeared almost 45 years ago and whose remains were found buried in a New York City backyard in 2019, authorities 

 Martin Motta faces 25 years to life in prison if he is convicted in the death of George Clarence Seitz, who was 81 when he was last seen in December 1976.

Motta made an appearance in court after being indicted by a Queens grand jury and is due back in court Friday. His attorney, Russell Rothberg, declined to comment.

""After 45 years, the alleged killer of a WWI Veteran is being held accountable and brought to justice,"" Katz said in a statement. ""We hope the identification of the remains and the indictment in this case will begin to bring peace and closure to his loved ones.""
Prosecutors said dismembered human remains were found in the backyard of a Queens home in March 2019, buried under some concrete.

Initially, a DNA profile of the remains was 
unsuccessful in leading to any identification, authorities said, but advanced efforts by a private lab in February 2021 led to a genealogical profile that authorities were able to use to find the victim's identity.
Authorities said Seitz disappeared Dec. 10, 1976, after leaving his residence, also in Queens, reportedly on his way to get a haircut.

The New York Police Department and the  
Queens district attorney's office conducted an investigation that included witness interviews and record searches in five states, and which led them to Motta, authorities said.

She splits custody with his father, Jim Wayne, who thought she was acting ""edgy"" at the game, and noted that she failed to call or text their son goodnight, which she normally did, either that night or the next, then failed to pick him up at his school for her scheduled custody time on October 20th. She was last seen leaving her home to attend the football game with her dog. The dog was found about three hours after Heidi was last seen, on the 28th floor of a secure apartment building in downtown LA. Her ex-husband claims Heidi has no connection to the building and finds it strange that the dog was able to get into a secure building and onto a secure floor with no key card. Allegedly, the building management wasn't cooperating in helping to figure that out, but a warrant has been secured.

Meanwhile, Wayne (the ex-husband) claims that the disappearance may be related to her job as a comptroller for Camden Capital Partners and that the company and her boss, Jason Sugarman, are under investigation by the SEC. Sugarman and his business partner were charged with multiple counts of fraud in 2019, and the business partner pled guilty last year and was sentenced to 15+ years in prison. Wayne says that the SEC contacted him regarding Sugarman, and that when he was speaking to someone at Planck's company about her disappearance, they didn't seem concerned about anything other than recovering her work computer, which Wayne turned over to the police.

TL;DR: a missing woman, an ex-husband, a shady boss, and a dog that mysteriously ends up elsewhere.

676,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1635984791,"On December 2nd, 1988, 19-year-old Cathy Sue Swartz went about her morning routine as usual at her Three Rivers, Michigan townhouse. The evening prior, Cathy’s boyfriend had stayed the night with her and her 9-month-old daughter, Courtney. They had spent the evening decorating the Christmas tree, putting up decorations, and wrapping presents for Courtney’s first Christmas. Around 5am, Cathy bid farewell to her boyfriend as he left for work, telling him she planned to spend the day catching up on laundry. 

Around 3:30pm, Cathy’s boyfriend returned to her two-story Riverside Townhouse located on Lockport Drive, only to discover the apartment's red front door was slightly ajar. Alarmed, he entered Cathy’s apartment where he was met with a nightmarish scene. Blood was splattered throughout the entire first floor of the apartment and led up the stairs to where Cathy and Courtney’s bedroom were located on the second floor. 

Cathy’s boyfriend ran upstairs where he found Cathy on her bedroom floor, partially clad, beaten, strangled, and riddled with stab wounds. After finding Cathy, he ran to Courtney’s room, where he found her unharmed, wearing a clean diaper, and playing quietly in her crib. He immediately summoned police. 

When officers arrived on scene, they were quoted as saying, *”Any adjective that you could think of as far as describing a brutal, violent scene was there.”*

It was determined that the attack on Cathy had started in the kitchen area of her townhouse. It is believed a struggle ensued, and Cathy was stabbed. She then made her way to the foyer, the entryway near the front door, before running upstairs and down the hallway to her bedroom. There, it is believed Cathy’s attacker sexually assaulted, strangled, and beat her, before stabbing her more than a dozen times, and slitting her throat. Her ultimate cause of death was listed as severe blood loss. (See sources for apartment floor plans.)

Investigators found nothing missing from Cathy’s home, and discovered no signs of forced entry. Cathy was found partially nude, however was still in her pajama’s leading detectives to believe she was attacked in the early afternoon. 

It was learned that while a good amount of blood found at the scene belonged to Cathy, some of it was not hers. Investigators believe during the struggle, Cathy’s attacker was injured. Aside from leaving behind a good amount of blood and a near perfect bloody fingerprint, Cathy’s murderer also left behind some other bizarre clues. 

A single bloody bare footprint was found in Cathy’s bathroom belonging to her attacker. Given that it was snowing outside, and no bloody footprints were found in the snow, detectives believe that Cathy’s killer had washed up and changed clothing and shoes before exiting the apartment. Even stranger still, messages written in blood were found on the refrigerator and on Cathy’s leg. Police only revealed what one of the messages said, *”I was here.”*

Neighbors were immediately questioned. Several claimed to have seen someone near the apartment that afternoon that they didn’t recognize. One a man, another a woman. A sketch was released, however neither was ever found. Two days later, police made an arrest in Cathy’s murder. Her ex-boyfriend, 18-year-old Troy Schulthies. 

Troy denied having anything to do with Cathy’s murder. He claimed to be working that day, and then attending a dance with a girlfriend. Although his alibi was backed up by multiple witnesses, and he passed a lie detector test, he was kept in jail. 

On December 8th, DNA evidence collected at the scene was compared to the DNA Troy had willingly submitted. It proved that Troy was not their killer and he was released on December 14th and cleared of being a suspect. He eventually sued the city for wrongful imprisonment, claiming that even after the DNA came back, they continued to hold him for no reason. 

Police continued their search for Cathy’s killer, comparing DNA from her boyfriend, friends, and family to the evidence collected at the scene. Investigators also collected more than 5000 footprints from potential suspects. They described it as a “morbid version of Cinderella.” Unfortunately no matches were ever made. 

Cathy was described as a quiet, kind, and gentle person who for the most part, stayed at home caring for her daughter. She enjoyed “tomboy things” like hunting, fishing, and camping, but was also a gifted artist. She didn’t have any history of drinking or drug use and according to everyone who knew her, she had no known enemies. 

In what may have been nothing more than a tragic coincidence, another mysterious death occurred in Three Rivers the same day as Cathy’s murder. Around noon, 24-year-old Christina Shelton, a neighbor of Cathy’s, drove her car into the nearby St. Joseph River with her 4-year-old daughter, Sara, in the backseat. 

A witness claimed that the car had suddenly veered off the road for “no apparent reason.” It took rescuers more than 30 minutes to retrieve the vehicle from the swift currents and icy waters. Sadly Christina never regained consciousness and passed away a few hours later at an area hospital. Sara, however, miraculously survived the ordeal. 

Like I said, it may be nothing more than a strange coincidence, but I thought it was worth mentioning as several articles I included in my sources speak about the cases being similar. However, the theory that the two cases are related is only speculation and has never been proven by law enforcement. 

Cathy’s mother and father, Audrey and David, took custody of Courtney after her murder. They continued to hunt for the person who savagely murdered their daughter and left their granddaughter without a mom. Sadly in 2012, Audrey passed away without ever getting the answers she so desperately sought. David, however, holds out hope that one day he will receive some amount of closure and the person responsible for Cathy’s murder will be brought to justice.

677,maaaaris,[],1635971384,"Stacyville John Doe was a man discovered on a logging trail in Stacyville, Maine, on November 4, 2010. There's a very detailed write-up on him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/kdclac/stacyville_maine_john_doe_november_4_2010_10/) that has been [updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/ps45lt/stacyville_john_doe_2010_identified_as/), but I was unable to find any other posts on this sub regarding the identification of Mr. Roof. I thought it would be nice to give Mr. Roof's story its own post, as so many Does have been given their names back for the past few months and had their stories told by many incredible people here. We're also a day from when Mr. Roof's remains were found, almost 11 years ago on November 4.

Mr. Roof was identified through DNA after a former student of his, Sydney Copp, listened to one of Josh Hallmark's podcasts and thought the description of Stacyville John Doe's clothing was familiar to what Mr. Roof's was known to wear before he went missing. Christopher Roof's family did not file a missing person's report as they believed Christopher had followed through with his plan of becoming homeless. Sydney was made aware of Roof's disappearence in 2011 through a Facebook group called ""Where is M. Roof?"", created by several of Mr. Roof's former students. In march of this year, Sydney was listening to a True Crime Bullsh\*\* episode when she heard the description of the clothing that Stacyville John Doe was wearing when he was found, thinking ""It all just seemed like Mr. Roof.""

True Crime Bullsh\*\* is a serialised, investigative podcast about Israel Keyes, his crimes and the story of many individuals that *may* or *may not* have been connected to Keyes. Stacyville John Doe's case was covered in Season 4, episode 13, and led Sydney to call the Maine State Police about it. Christopher Roof's story is covered again in the first episode of Season 5 after the identification of his remains and Sydney Copp is featured in it. I highly recommend people to check the episode out as it is very emotional to listen to someone that knew Roof talk about the person he was in life and read one of his poems.

Christopher Roof was born on April 24, 1951, was last seen in August 2010, and his death was estimated to have happened in early September. His cause of death is unknown and there were no signs of foul play.

Thank you, u/thismakesmesaaaaad, for making me aware of Mr. Roof's identification and for posting about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimePodcasts/comments/q2t4vt/remains_of_a_man_missing_for_11_years_were_found/).

678,HYphY420ayy,[],1635966850,"FAA has released a new photo and video taken from a LAPD Helicopter last year that seems to show that the 'jetpack man' is a human-sized and shaped balloon resembling Jack Skellington from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Other aviation experts have agreed that the object in the video matches the description airline pilots have given over the last year. 

a bit of an underwhelming end to the entire ordeal, I don't think most people seriously considered it to be a jetpack, as the tech we have now is so glaringly behind what was being reported. My favorite theory was that it was a mannequin/blow up doll attached to a drone.

information on the three sightings: 

&gt; The first was on August 30, 2020, 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 30, 2020 by an American Airlines flight crew on final approach to LAX. Another happened nearly two months later, on Oct. 14, when the pilot of a China Airlines flight said there was an object sighted at around 6,000 feet over Culver City or Century City, and responded yes when an air traffic controller asked if the object resembled a jet pack.
&gt; 
&gt; The third, earlier this year on July 28, occurred at approximately 6:10 p.m., when the pilot of a Kalitta Air Cargo 747 on approach to LAX over the Santa Fe Springs and Whittier areas told air traffic controllers he could see the 'jet man' off his right wing at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. 


at least we got legendary quote from the ordeal:
&gt; “Possible jetpack man in sight,” the pilot said at the time. After air traffic controllers and pilots discussed the sighting, a pilot simply said, “**We’re looking for the Iron Man**.”

[Melissa Witt](https://uncovered.com/cases/melissa-witt) was a hardworking and ambitious, 19-year-old college student. Also known as Missy, she was an honors student at Westark Community College in Fort Smith, Arkansas where she lived with her mother, Mary Ann. Missy kept very busy with classes and her part-time job at a local dental clinic where she worked as a dental assistant. Her friends say she was friendly, kind-hearted, and a hard worker, which would serve her well as she dreamed of and was working toward her goal of becoming a dental hygienist.

**The day Missy went missing.** [December 1, 1994, was a typical day for Missy.](https://uncovered.com/cases/melissa-witt/timeline) But as she got ready to go to campus for class, she had a small disagreement with her Mom after asking her if she could borrow money. Her mother said no and before she left the house, she left Missy a note explaining that she loved her and that she would be at a local bowling alley later that afternoon if she wanted to come by and get something to eat.

Between 6:30-7 pm, after class and work, Missy went to the same bowling alley that her mother had mentioned in her note. She parked her car, and before she would even make it inside the bowling alley, investigators believe Missy was abducted from the parking lot. They made this determination based on evidence of a struggle around her car, including blood found in the parking lot, as well as Missy's keys and an earring found nearby.

**When she was discovered.** Six weeks after the abduction, two hunters in the Ozark National Forest discovered Missy's body on January 13, 1995—45 miles from her home in Fort Smith. Missy's body was nude and placed near a headstone-shaped rock. [However, Missy's clothes and personal belongings were missing from the scene and were never found.](https://www.thv11.com/article/news/crime/true-crime/unsolved-melissa-witt-arkansas-cold-case/91-1fb81897-3163-4800-b7d7-c99641300b7a)

He was convicted of the murder of Melissa Trotter who was killed in a very similar manner as Missy. Both girls were 19 at the time of their death, and both were murdered and found in large forests in Arkansas. Furthermore, Swearingen was known to be in the area around the time Missy was abducted. Swearingen denied murdering Missy Witt and was executed on January 27, 2009, for Melissa Trotter's murder.

**Where the case stands today.** No one has been convicted of her murder, and there is currently a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for Missy's abduction and murder.

A documentary is being developed to cover Missy's case, and community advocates recently launched a [billboard campaign](https://www.4029tv.com/article/melissa-witt-fort-smith-billboards/38127638) to highlight her unsolved murder.

680,debrisslide,[],1635958189,"[https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/16509/details?nav](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/16509/details?nav) **(content warning for postmortem photos, though she is in good condition. she also has a slightly NSFW keychain among her belongings.)**

I was browsing NamUs and decided to look for any unidentified persons in my home state of Pennsylvania, and noted that only one was listed in the county I grew up in (Fayette). Ever since I saw her photos a few months ago I couldn't stop thinking about her, so I decided to post about her in the hopes of generating some interest in her case.

Here are some bullet points about her and the circumstances of her death:

* She was a passenger occupant of a semitruck that seems to have gone off the road and rolled over on May 2, 1986
* The NamUs page doesn't have any information about the driver of the truck or the accident, but a story appeared in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about her on June 13, 1986 which gives some more information: [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88270584/](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88270584/). The driver was identified as Joseph D. Richards of Eastanollee, Georgia (spelled wrong in the Post-Gazette as Eastanolle) who was 34 years old. He is also deceased as a result of the same accident. Richards was driving for the Wilkinson Trucking Company out of Commerce, Georgia per the PG article.
* [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88272014/](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/88272014/) Again according to the Post-Gazette, she was buried in late June. 
* [http://www.google.com/maps/place/39.9272324,-79.6502105](http://www.google.com/maps/place/39.9272324,-79.6502105) this is the location provided for the site of the accident. This is a somewhat rural area but it is off of a state highway (PA 119) which would have been there at the time in 1986. It is also very close to US 40 which is still an important route that crosses the Appalachian mountains in Pennsylvania (though there would have been better routes for longer trips across the state or country like Interstate 76 which is more distant from this spot). The location of the accident suggests that the truck had a specific reason to be in this area which I assume law enforcement was aware of at the time.
* Her nickname at the time was ""The Hitcher"" (there was a movie out that year with that title which is a serial killer flick, seems pretty rude of state police to call her that!) She has since been generally referred to as **Springhill Jane Doe**. I don't think anyone from the area would refer to that spot as ""Springhill"" today though, would probably be referred to as Shady Grove or Lemont Furnace.
* Items recovered include Marlboro cigarettes and cash ($333 which seems like a big number for everyday money - in 2021 dollars, it's equivalent to $793.58 [https://www.saving.org/inflation/inflation.php?amount=333&amp;year=1986](https://www.saving.org/inflation/inflation.php?amount=333&amp;year=1986)). The cigarettes/cash was found near the body so may not have necessarily been hers, though.
* On her person was jewelry and keys on a keychain that reads ""Hot &amp; Horny""

Questions/theories:

* Based on the circumstances it is very likely that she was a sex worker or hitchhiker and could have been picked up anywhere where the truck had been. It seems that looking into the truck's route and the driver would be the logical next step. It's unclear how much this was pursued at the time and obviously it's been over 30 years, so relevant records may no longer exist, but that seems like a good place to start?
* Presumably she wasn't known to the driver's friends/family otherwise she might have been identified at the time. I also don't suspect she was local to the area where she died since this is a very small town environment and I believe she would have been recognized by someone.
* Because her face is in very good condition it might be easy to match her to a missing persons report from the time period if she was reported missing.
* While a paper in Pittsburgh wrote about her about a month later, I'd like to find if a local newspaper covered this accident at the time. But [newspapers.com](https://newspapers.com) does not seem to have the Herald-Standard which is the newspaper in Uniontown, PA. It does have the two papers that eventually merged and became the Herald-Standard (The Morning Herald and the Evening Standard) but those archives end in 1977. My dad thinks the papers merged into a single edition in 1980. The Herald-Standard ""archives"" appear to just be a very bad search feature: [https://www.heraldstandard.com/search/?t=article&amp;s=start\_time&amp;q](https://www.heraldstandard.com/search/?t=article&amp;s=start_time&amp;q) and I can't find anything at all from the relevant time period online.

Next steps/follow up:

* The next time I am home to visit my family I would like to visit the location where the accident occurred and do some research about what was going on in the area at the time.
* I will also visit the local public library and look at newspaper archives to see if there is any more information about her in the local paper.

This is a relatively out of the way place for her to have come to if she was not from anywhere nearby. This is coal country and farmland and wooded mountains mostly, even more so back then. I don't know what local law enforcement might have done at the time to try to identify her but her case was entered into NamUs in 2017.

The teenager was hitchhiking when the car he was in went off a bridge into a river. The driver survived, but didn't know much about the boy, since they had just met. He was never identified, despite a number of efforts, and was buried under a grave marker that read ""Unknown in Life but Recognized in Death.""

Genetic genealogy has identified him as 15-year-old Daniel Paul Armantrout, known as Danny. He was one of three brothers who were raised by a terribly abusive stepfather. 

His older brother, Don Hamilton, is still alive at age 77. Don never knew what happened to Danny, who ran away. Their older brother David also ran away and has never been heard from again. Don joined the army at 17 to escape. 

The end of the article is both beautiful and tragic. I'm glad Danny Armantrout has got his name back.
&gt; 
&gt; The last time Mr. Hamilton saw Danny was when he was home from military service for a couple of weeks during Christmas break in 1960, shortly before the youngest brother ran away. The two went into the mountains by their rural home in Tennessee to go squirrel shooting, one of their favorite activities. One of their only activities, actually. They were dirt poor. There was no TV. No phone. Few other kids around.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Hamilton said that Danny didn’t say anything to him about running away but that he knew Danny made the same calculation the older brothers had already made: They could stick around and take the abuse or try life on their own.
&gt; 
&gt; “It wasn’t much of a choice,” Mr. Hamilton said.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Hamilton, and the town that laid the boy to rest the first time, will say goodbye again by dedicating a grave cover, this one with a name attached and this time with a loved one present.
&gt; 
&gt; The granite slab will have the name of the brothers’ biological father, Armantrout. Hamilton was the name of their abusive stepfather, Mr. Hamilton said. It’s too late for a name change for himself, he said, as he is well established in the world as Don Hamilton, but he wanted his little brother to escape the name, at least at his grave site.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Hamilton plans to drive his motor home to Centreville for the ceremony, scheduled for Dec. 28, which would have been Danny’s 76th birthday.

Paula Abdul was at the top of her performance career in the 90s. She was hugely popular as choreographer and singer. Then in the mid 90s she disappeared from the entertainment scene. Not much was known about why at the time, until she reappeared on television years later.

Paula claims she was involved in a plane crash during her tour that left her partially paralyzed. She took years out to recover from her injuries. The problem is that no records of this crash into an Iowa cornfield exist at the time she alleges. Furthermore, no media attention of the story at the time.

Why do you think no records of this exist? I'm interested to hear your theories about what you think happened.

*\[Transcript From Video\]*

On Saturday 4th October 1986, at around 10:43pm, 54 year old TV anchorman Dan Rather was walking home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, after finishing a dinner with an associate at 1095 Park Avenue on 89th Street. It wasn’t long after leaving when two men in their 30’s started following Rather down the street, and eventually began accosting him, with one of them repeating the phrase ‘Kenneth, what is the frequency?’ multiple times. Rather explained to the two that they had the wrong man, and that he had no idea what they were talking about, which only elevated their aggressive pursuit.

Upon reaching 88th Street, one of the men punched Rather in the jaw, just under the left ear, knocking him to the pavement. Rather quickly got up and fled into the nearby lobby of 1075 Park Avenue, where the attackers pursued and continued their assault, shouting the same phrase over and over whilst punching and kicking him. Both the doorman and superintendent of the building witnessed the attack, with the latter intervening and coming to Rather’s aid as the assailants fled the scene. Rather suffered multiple bruises on his back and a swelling of the jaw, but neither of the two attackers robbed him of any possessions, despite him having a reasonable amount of money on him at the time.

Rather was taken to Lenox Hill hospital and assessed, but soon discharged with only minor injuries. He told police and detectives that one of the men who attacked him was 6ft tall, had dark hair and a mustache, and both were well dressed, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and black tie. It wasn’t clear whether or not the attack was intentional or a case of mistaken identity, due to the fact that the name ‘Kenneth’ was directed at Rather throughout the ordeal.

A few days later, on Monday 6th October, Dan Rather was back on his usual slot on CBS hosting the Evening News. In his closing statement, Rather addressed the attack on national television, after news had spread about the bizarre incident in newspapers.

Papers ran the story during the early days of the incident, but the case soon faded into obscurity when no further progress was made into who was responsible. The mysterious phrase, however, did anything but disappear.

In the following years, the line ‘What’s The Frequency, Kenneth?’, which oddly is a mistranslation of the original quote itself, became somewhat of a pop-culture reference in other forms of media. In 1987, the year after the attack, California based band Game Theory released their album ‘Lolita Nation’, with the opening 46 second track being titled ‘Kenneth, What’s The Frequency?’, inspired by the strange events of Rather’s attack. A few years later, in 1993, Daniel Clowes released the otherworldly graphic novel ‘Like A Velvet Glove Cast In Iron’, where the phrase is used as part of a subplot involving a conspiracy theorist. In the story, a character called Billings aggressively asks the protagonist ‘What’s the frequency, Kenneth?’, believing that a mythical, god-like creature known as ‘Mr. Jones’ exists, and can only be contacted by achieving a ‘specific mental frequency’. Much like the incident with Dan Rather, the protagonist’s name in the comic is also not Kenneth.

More famously, the American rock band R.E.M released the album ‘Monster’ in 1994, which included the hit single ‘What’s The Frequency, Kenneth?’. The single, which reached number 21 in the top 40 charts, was inspired by Rather’s now infamous incident, with the band’s lead singer Michael Stipe explaining, “It was the premier unsolved American surrealist act of the 20th century...It’s a misunderstanding that was scarily random, media-hyped and just plain bizarre”. A year after it’s release, R.E.M performed the song live on The Late Show with David Letterman, and was joined by none other than Dan Rather himself, albeit a slightly out of tune and out of rhythm one.

The now infamous ‘Kenneth’ case looked as though it were going to remain firmly archived in the library of peculiar crimes, lost to time in the corridors of forgotten media. But what nobody knew at the time, is that one of the ‘Kenneth’ duo had already struck again, and this time he had become a killer.

On Wednesday 31st August 1994 at around 5pm, almost a month before R.E.M were to release their new album, a man approached the Rockefeller Center in Manhattan where The Today Show studios are situated. Armed with a rifle hidden inside the sleeve of a smock coat, the man tried to storm into the studio, only to be stopped by an NBC stagehand, 33 year old Campbell Montgomery, who noticed the firearm. The man quickly left in his car, before returning around 20 minutes later. Montgomery was standing at the building's entrance when he noticed the man return, so tried to alert the police. The gunman then took a military stance and fatally shot Montgomery in the back.

The man was quickly apprehended and arrested, and was identified as being 46 year old William Tager from North Carolina.

When interviewed by the police, Tager claimed that NBC had been beaming transmissions into his brain for years, watching him and sending him signals, and that the attack he had planned on the studio himself was to stop the transmissions once and for all. He was paranoid to the point that he drove a rented car to the studios, as he thought the network had bugged his own, and claimed to have no history of drugs or alcohol abuse.

Likely due to having mental capacity issues, Tager was found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder, and received a 12 and a half to 25 year prison sentence at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. It’s during his time behind bars that the story gets even weirder, as Tager opened up to prison staff about his supposed intentions.

During an interview in January 1997, he told prison psychiatrists that he was a time-traveller from the year 2265, and that he was already a convicted felon in his timeline who was sent on a highly-experimental mission back in time in exchange for his freedom. He also claimed that the future authorities were tracking his movements via a chip implanted in his brain, so they knew where he was in the past.

It’s at this point that Tager then admitted to being one of the two men who attacked Dan Rather over 10 years prior, and explained that the reason for the attack was because he looked like his timeline’s Vice President, known as ‘Kenneth Burrows’.

Dan Rather was shown pictures of Tager and confirmed that he was one of the attackers in his case, claiming “There is no doubt in my mind that this is the person.” Both Tager and Rather gave identical recollections and details of the building where the attack took place which wasn’t public knowledge, leaving authorities with no doubt that the story was true. The second assailant in the attack on Rather, however, has never been identified and remains a mystery to this day.

So, case closed right? Well actually, no. There is another theory as to why Tager actually committed the attack on Dan Rather which makes a lot more sense, and it’s somewhat interesting that Tager never mentioned this himself as being the truth behind his actions.

Around the time of the initial attack on Dan Rather, a former music publicist-turned-inventor called Kenneth Schaffer had figured out a way to hijack Russian television broadcasts using U.S. satellites receivers so that Americans could watch content from Soviet networks. During the peak of Cold War tensions between the two states, little was known about television behind the Iron Curtain, and so this gave people in the West an opportunity to view Soviet television, such as soap operas, cartoons and cooking programs. Schaffer had these intercepted broadcasts available to view at Columbia University in New York, which drew a number of visitors who had an interest in learning about the Soviet Union. One of these visitors just so happened to be Dan Rather, who viewed the project at Columbia University on the same day that he was attacked.

Ken Schaffer believes that he himself was more than likely the ‘Kenneth’ that Tager was after that night, and that Dan Rather was perhaps mistaken for him after being spotted leaving the campus. Schaffer admitted that there were always people questioning him about how the interception technology worked, but he would never reveal what the frequencies were publicly.

Is it possible then, that Tager had more ulterior motives then he is letting on as to why he wanted to know the frequencies for Schaffer’s technology? Since it was during the height of political tension between the USSR and the USA, could it be possible that Tager was working for the Russian government, sent to find out the frequencies used for intercepting Soviet broadcasting, in order to attempt to shut it down? Was Tager’s schizophrenia and paranoia just a cover up for his true intentions? Probably not, but it’s an interesting theory nonetheless.

On the 27th October 2010, at the age of 63, William Tager was released from prison on parole after earning a limited time credit allowance. It states on his certificate of release that, amongst other things, he must submit to regular substance abuse testing and anti-violence counselling, mustn’t consume alcohol and is prohibited from driving.

So there you have it, the story of how a random attack on an anchorman birthed an alternative rock record and eventually lead to a murder over a decade later. There is only one question to this story however that remains unanswered to this day...

What was the frequency, Kenneth?

I have been following TC since I  found out that Criminal Minds, the TV Show, was sometimes loosely based on real events. I was roughly 11 at the time, and have slowly gotten deeper into it over the past 14 years. I think the climate is changing, and would love a discussion about it.

Gabby Petito. EVERYONE knows her name, or they know scumbag's name, or at bare minimum that a blonde girl went missing and her boyfriend killed her (although not proven, that is society's consensus). The awareness was great, but now TC is in the world's view. People who previously had no interest in TC joined during a case that has so much attention on online sleuths and their role that I am afraid they will not understand the amount of TC cases that go unsolved (See my links at the bottom of this post).

I am now personally seeing friends and family who never shared TC on my social media pages sharing random missing persons from all over, not just our area, and even saying things like ""we saw how the internet brought Gabby home, let's do it again."" Has the dynamic shifted in such a way that now the TC online sleuths are going to think that all cases can be solved by us? When in reality, Gabby was not solved by online sleuths. If anyone helped it was the vlogger/blogger who was reviewing video footage from their own camping trip upon the cops asking everyone who was in the area to review video footage. 

My main point -- We know too much involvement with online sleuths who become obsessed over cases can cause detriment to cases. Newer TC followers are likely to not understand the importance of discussions without inserting themselves into the case, for example the facebook groups, and even people on reddit giving out Brian's home address to send letters to, or Gabby's parent's home address to send flowers to. Secondly, will they understand the sheer amount of cases that go unsolved? Thoughts?

691,AMissKathyNewman,[],1635846234,"I have been listening to The Prosecutors Podcasts take on the [Dyatlov Pass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident) incident and I must say they really are brining a lot of extra evidence to the table and making me doubt everything I thought about the case. 

On the surface, the case is simple. A group of campers flee their tent due to some emergency/incident, run into the freezing cold and succumb to the elements. But when you take a deeper look at the evidence it all becomes so perplexing.

Firstly, the tent was cut from the inside and campers 'fled' the tent without properly dressing for the elements, this would indicate a level of urgency. Yet the footprints in the snow showed that the campers walked rather than ran away from the tent in a calm and orderly fashion. What could have been so urgent that you couldn't use the door of the tent and get dressed, but not urgent enough to run away from the tent.

Next up the crushing injuries some of the campers sustained, how did that even happen?! Some suggest an avalanche but the contents of the tent were found in good condition (hot cocoa found in a mug and biscuits found perfectly intact), how could an avalanche have hit the tent but everything inside be totally OK? Not to mention the footprints of all the campers going down the slope,  indicating that the injuries were sustained after leaving the tent. Some of the campers were found in a ravine, but it wasn't deep enough to cause the injuries and the campers would have had external injuries to accompany the crushing injuries if they were due to a fall. 

All I can really say to explain things is that the footprints in the snow are incorrect and the campers did actually flee the tent and the crushing injuries were sustained after death when a slab of snow fell on the bodies.


Anyway, that is my example of a case that becomes more and more perplexing the more you look into it. What are yours?

692,CordialTourist,[],1635836890,"A release from Spokane Police said Sorenson allegedly sold Eisenman’s daughter to a sex-trafficking organization in Seattle last year. Eisenman and his fiancee rescued her and brought her back to Spokane in 2020.

In November 2020, Eisenman reportedly learned Sorenson was going to be at an Airway Heights trailer park. Court documents state Eisenman admitted to confronting the 19-year-old, abducting him, ziptying his hands and feet and putting him in the trunk of his fiancee’s car.

Police said Eisenman then hit Sorenson in the head with a cinder block and stabbed him to death.

According to court records, Eisenman told officers he drove the car and abandoned it, with the Sorenson’s body inside, in a remote part of north Spokane County. He told police he removed the battery of the car so no one would drive it.

The car stayed in the area until it was moved nearly a year later to Northeast Spokane near Rochester Heights Park. Police do not believe the driver knew a body was in the trunk at the time.

Eisenman, who has no recent criminal history, nor any violent criminal history, was arrested. He appeared in court Monday and had his bond set a $1 million.

If you follow any of the comments back to their original channels, many of them have the same format of seemingly mundane video with weblike spam of comments and replies. They seem almost definitely to not be bots, the channels have real content, and the responses show some form of awareness of what they're watching.

694,Cooperdyl,[],1635824345,"Iris Rita Braidwood travelled to Australia from her native England in March 2003 to visit two of her married daughters who lived in the country. The 76 year old, who most commonly went by Rita, was a mother of 9 children, and grandmother to 21. 

Rita was last seen by family as she was dropped off by her daughter in Croydon Street, Cronulla, for a shopping trip. Cronulla is a southern beach-town in the suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ([map for reference](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/a4VFm9mf82eU3C0PL6i076IhiL8aqdIPM8hyfdoQREELK9l-T3pmPdwauogwoahL8XTQ5MztrXkb4vcn9_jB0YfKVq46k4ksHOD7FU_ORmeUdIPe3Q)). The Croydon Street mall, where Rita was dropped off, is a busy strip of shops frequented by locals and visitors alike, near to a number of beaches in the Cronulla area. Rita failed to meet her daughter later that day to be picked up as arranged, as has not been seen by family since. 

Four witnesses reported seeing Rita on the afternoon she went missing and the following day, showing no signs of distress. Two men reported seeing Rita on the walking track near Wanda Beach, around a 15-minute walk from the Croydon Street mall at which she was dropped off, on the afternoon she disappeared. The men reported she was carrying her handbag and appeared in no sign of distress. The next day, tellers at the ANZ and Westpac banks in Cronulla believe they served Rita, who was trying to purchase British Pounds. One of the tellers reportedly viewed Rita's British passport, and made a note of her name due to a family connection to a town named Braidwood. An inquest in 2006 questioned how Rita could have appeared to the tellers on the second day of her disappearance without looking dishevelled, dirty or disoriented despite the fact she would have had to have spent a night on the street. There have also been no reports of Rita asking any passer-by's for help or directions. There have been no reports of Rita since the second day of her disappearance. 

The night prior to her appearance, another of Rita's daughters had supposedly confiscated her credit card due to the fact she had been spending too much. In the February prior to her disappearance, Rita had supposedly attempted to put a $48,000 down-payment on a house in Cronulla, but had used an incorrectly labelled cheque (and was thus refused). She had twice previously been admitted to hospital in England, once over concerns of her over-spending. A daughter of Rita's reported that she ""had frantically gone buying furniture and junk."" Rita had previously gone wandering, and had at one point spent a whole night missing in England after failing to catch a bus. It is believed Rita had shown early signs of dementia prior to her disappearance. 

The 2006 inquest ruled that Rita must be dead. She had not been seen or heard from since the day after her disappearance in March 2003, and her bank accounts had not been touched. Her family speculated she may have wandered off from her family due to their attempts to curb her spending, become confused and sought refuge in a convent, joined a religious sect or drowned in Cronulla. Rita was reportedly unable to swim, but one of her daughters noted she may have gone to cool her feet in the water if she had walked a long distance. The inquest failed to find a method of death, but her family believes she drowned, and posited that may be the reason that no evidence has been found. 

To throw my own two-cents in as a local of the area, it seems likely that Iris Rita Braidwood may have gotten confused and disoriented, perhaps not used to the hot Australian weather and suffering from symptoms of dementia. Drowning seems the most likely scenario as to why her remains haven't been found, although if she were to just 'dip her feet in' the water it would make sense she would do so somewhere shallow. The fact nobody saw Rita's disappearance makes me believe she may have accidentally entered the water at night, perhaps at a location deeper than she thought she would find. I am amazed that no bones or remains have been found as the beaches of Cronulla are immensely popular, but I myself can't find any other alternative to make sense.

Born in New York City in 1941, Esmond Bradley Martin was a dedicated conservationist. He moved to Nairobi, Kenya in the mid 1970s, where he published a variety of books covering historical and anthropological topics. But it was not until 1979, that he found his true calling: Martin was asked by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to help combat the illegal elephant ivory trade. He first investigation into the ivory trade appeared in December 1979. 


The rest of his career was dedicated to protecting elephants against the illegal ivory trade and protecting rhinos against the illegal rhino horn trade. From the late 1970s to 2018, these investigations required Martin to travel a lot and take considerable risks in order to gather data on the ivory trade in the black market. During these investigations, Martin often went deep undercover, documenting everything, including photographing illegals sales of ivory and rhino horns and uncovering all the secrets of merchants. The countries he went undercover in to expose the ivory trade include the United States, Congo, Nigeria, Angola, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. It is thanks to Martin’s work that China moved to ban the sale of the rhino horn trade in the 1990s and ivory later on. Esmond Bradley Martin also served as a United Nations special envoy for rhino conservation. 


**Murder**


On February 4, 2018, 76 year old, Esmond Bradley Martin was alone in his home in Nairobi. Martin had just returned from a research trip to Myanmar and was writing about his findings. Around 11am that Sunday morning, Martin left home briefly for a lunch date at Nairobi National Park. He had asked the cook to prepare packed lunch and left with his driver. His wife, Chryssee Perry, also a conservationist, left home at around 2 pm for a meeting at the Nairobi's animal orphanage, where she was a volunteer. 


Shortly after 2pm, the cook switched on the electric fence, locked the back door and retired to the servant quarters until 6pm when he returned to make dinner. When the cook arrived at the house, he noticed the electric fence had been switched off which was odd since the fence was always on during the day. Martin’s vehicle was parked outside when his wife returned home some minutes after 6pm. She alerted Martin with "" I am back.” She then headed to the library on the ground floor of the building as there was no response. 


Chryssee then went upstairs, hoping to find her husband at the study but he was not there. She then went to her bedroom (they slept in separate rooms) and took a nap but was awoken by the cook who came in through the back door. Chryssee asked the cook if he had seen Martin and and he said no. This made her worry and so she then checked Martin’s bedroom that is where she found Martin lying facedown in a pool of blood on the carpet. It was 6.45pm and he was motionless. Martin had been gagged with a tie and stabbed several times in the neck. He was stabbed to death. 


**Aftermath + Theories**


Police were able to establish that killing was premeditated because the killer didn’t appear to take much. There was also no forced entry into the house. Martin's wallet was in his jacket pocket with Sh11,000. His watch, with a black strap, was left on the table while the mobile phone was in another pocket. The only place that was disturbed was the green steel filing cabinet. It is not clear what documents it contained. The back gate that opened into the bushes was left open, perhaps by the planners or killers. The padlock was also missing. Detectives found the remote controlled panic alarm unit attached to a silver chain and that was always at Martin's bedside, under the conservationist's bed. While this was noted by initial investigators on the evening that Martin's body was found, it later disappeared and has never been accounted for.


Police suspected two possible motives, the killer wanted to either stop his work as an investigator or someone wanted to grab his Sh1 billion property in Karen, Nairobi where he owned 20 acres.
There was a message on Martin’s phone, which seemed to indicate that somebody was conversing with him about land. The New York Times reported that the murder was ""linked to a property dispute"" and in 2018, a local publication reported that there was an attempt at the land registry to grab the property.


No arrests have been made in connection with the murder and the case still remains unsolved. Martin's family did hire a private investigator from South Africa but no leads were found.

But does anyone have a case where they believe it’s a real possibility, with any evidence? In the Brandon Lawson case, it was noted that there was no bank or social security number activity since his disappearance.

It seems to be one of those solutions regularly trotted out for a missing adult, like a pedophile gang for a missing child, regardless of the evidence of the case. Until there’s a conclusive answer it can’t be ruled out - Andrew Godsen *could* have successfully run away to start a new life - but it’s unlikely. I feel cruel saying this, but it has always struck me as false hope, something better than death. Does anyone have a case in mind where there’s some evidence making it seem plausible?

New information has come out from a warrant released Wednesday in the case against Larry Millete, who has been charged in his wife's disappearance. 

&gt; The eight-page arrest warrant laid out how investigators say they arrived at the conclusion there's no evidence May left on her own, or that she had the financial means to do so.   
&gt;  
&gt;They say they found evidence he also googled things like ""plant you take to never wake up"" and drugs such as Rohypnol, the so-called date rape drug.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the warrant, family members described Larry's behavior as ""controlling"" and ""stalker-like.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The warrant also revealed May had confided in a friend about her marital issues, revealing one time in the past Larry had choked her until she passed out. 

During the press conference,  San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan accused Larry of murder, but acknowledged there would be some questions because no body has been found yet. 

&gt; Larry claimed that Maya “voluntarily” left him and their three children. He alleged in a petition, intended to keep their three kids away from her side of the family, that she had been acting “erratically” before her disappearance. He stopped cooperating with police soon after his wife’s disappearance, a public information officer for the Chula Vista department told Oxygen.com back in February. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Larry Millete, the husband of missing California mom May ""Maya"" Millete, has pleaded not guilty to her murder.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plea was entered during an in-person arraignment on Thursday. Along with one count of first-degree murder, Larry, 40, pleaded not guilty to illegal possession of an assault weapon, a spokesperson for the San Diego County District Attorney's Office confirms to PEOPLE.  
&gt;  
&gt;During his court appearance, which was livestreamed by KFMB-TV, Larry waived his right to a reading of the criminal complaint against him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Online jail records show that Larry is currently being held without bail.

699,Kagedeah,[],1635774157,"A man who admitted killing two women in 1987 abused female corpses in two hospital morgues, a court has been told.

&amp;#x200B;

David Fuller, 67, of Heathfield, East Sussex, attacked Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce in Tunbridge Wells.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuller previously admitted killing them subject to ""diminished responsibility"", but denied murder.

&amp;#x200B;

A jury at Maidstone Crown Court heard Mr Fuller had ""depraved sexual predilections"".

&amp;#x200B;

Warning: this article contains information some people may find distressing.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr Fuller worked as an electrician at the Kent and Sussex Hospital from 1989, before moving to the Tunbridge Wells Hospital in 2010.

&amp;#x200B;

Duncan Atkinson QC for the prosecution said he used the access his job gave him to enter both hospital mortuaries and ""carry out acts of sexual penetration of female corpses"".

&amp;#x200B;

His ""clear sexual interest in such bizarre and grossly repellent activity provides a unique and terrible link between him"" and the deaths of the two women, Mr Atkinson said.

&amp;#x200B;

Both Ms Knell and Ms Pierce were sexually abused at the time of, or after their deaths, the jury heard.

&amp;#x200B;

Miss Knell, 25, was killed in her home in Guildford Road on 23 June 1987 after being dropped off by her boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

She was found the following day, after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up to work.

&amp;#x200B;

She had been struck to the head with a blunt heavy object and strangled, possibly ""by an arm lock"", the court heard.

&amp;#x200B;

Miss Pierce, 20 was abducted from outside her home in Grosvenor Park on 24 November.

&amp;#x200B;

Neighbours reported hearing screaming, but it was three weeks before her almost naked body was found more than 40 miles away in Romney Marsh.

&amp;#x200B;

She had almost identical injuries to Ms Knell.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Aug. 9 (UPI)—The voice of a “very scared” boy resumed broadcasting on a citizen's band frequency in the foothills of central New Mexico today. Searchers said they were closing in on the area where the 7‐year‐old was believed to be lost in his father's pickup truck.

The boy, who said his first name was Larry, told rescuers last night that he and his father had been in an accident and that his father was dead.

Three pilots reported sighting a truck in the Red Rock Canyon area on the east face of the Manzano Mountains southeast of Albuquerque. A helicopter was dispatched to the area.

The voice of the boy faded out earlier today. Hours later the thin, tired voice was heard again on citizens’ band radio.

“We had three planes in the Red Rock Canyon area and they have been yelling that they have seen something,” said Col. Richard Damerow of the Civil Air Patrol. “But they say they can't be certain so we're sending another unit in to check.”

An Army’ search plane had monitored a transmission from the boy during the night that led searchers to the hills.

Sgt. W. A. Schmidt of Albuquerque said searchers had lost contact with the boy for several hours and presumed that he had either gone to sleep or the battery on his radio had gone dead.

“The last transmission he had from him said that he was in a white pickup that was on its side, that his father had a head injury, that he [the boy] was not injured but couldn't get out,” Sergeant Schmidt said.

More than 150 persons using radio monitors and directional finders searched the foothills.

Mr. Schmidt, an amateur radio operator, said that the searchers had not discounted the possibility of a hoax.
“I personally have never had any doubt that this is the real thing,” he said. “I heard the kid crying. I just can't believe it isn't the real thing.”

State Police Capt. Mel West said that tracing equipment had not been able to pinpoint the boy's signals because of interference from other citizens band operators.

Then, i found one girl on Youtube. I don´t want to post her name, cause she was against it, but she does not have any problem to share these informations, regarding the creepy broadcast. At first, i was like always - skeptical. But then, she send me few more videos about one of these people, that were missing, with some ""new leads"". I will now post them below.

703,likeawolf,[],1635731561,"This is just an observation so if you disagree feel free to discuss, but I’ve noticed that a lot of people seem to overestimate how much the general public knows about this sort of stuff. I see a lot wondering how no one has seen missing person X or suspect Y or fugitive Z, but is that really surprising?

I’ve been following true crime for years yet I’m pretty sure I could walk past a “popular” missing person like Maura Murray/Asha Degree/Andrew Gosden/Brian Schaffer and not know. I could see someone on the FBI’s Most Wanted List and not even realize. Something would have to really stand out for me to even start thinking about it. 

Now imagine people who don’t care about true crime! I can’t think of a single person I know that would even know the names of most missing/wanted people. None of them are identifying one on sight. There are millions of people who aren’t even familiar with the widely covered cases. Add in a) appearance in pictures and in person can differ b) people change their hair c) weight gain/loss and aging and d) very old pictures that look like they were taken on a potato, and you might as well show them a cave drawing. 

Then there are cases of missing people from places like NYC or L.A. where people are baffled that they wouldn’t be spotted. These cities are HUGE. Ace locations if you want to blend in, especially if you’re homeless. You can also find a job/apt/room off the books that doesn’t give a shit about IDs (no, you’re not gonna be an off the books senior marketing consultant with a retirement plan, but you probably already know this if you’ve gone this far), public transport, deal in cash, meet understanding people, etc. This can apply to really any large city with a good variety of people.

704,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,[],1635726162,"Perhaps the most mysterious mystery ever,  

And one you most likely know by now. 

Recap:

On the night of December 15, 1900, a transatlantic steamer named the Archtor passed the lighthouse, and noticed its light was off. After docking, they reported the red flag. What happened next is some men revealing a mystery that is still unsolved to this day.

When investigator arrived at the lighthouse, they entered the crew’s living quarters, they noticed a clock that stopped, the table being set for a meal that was never eaten, and a chair was toppled over. A supply box had been smashed open and its contents strewn across the ground despite being over a hundred feet above sea level. Iron railings on the side of a path had been bent and twisted out of shape, part of a railway track had been torn from its concrete moorings and a huge rock weighing more than a ton had been displaced. Turf had also been ripped up from the tops of the cliffs two hundred feet above sea level. There was no sign of the three keepers.  

Theories:

1) The men tried to get away with debt/abducted/ufologists.

The main problem with this theory is many logbook entries of them escaping was faked by a publishing news company just to get attention, and the UFOs and Kraken sea creatures sound the least plausible.

2) A light keeper murdered the other two, then killed himself.

One of the keepers was a man by the name of William MacArthur, who was very hot-tempered, and was thought to be involved in a fight, and killed the other two. Although this may sound plausible, there was no evidence of a fight or murder to have taken place. Although they might have fought, but without their bodies, we may never know if such a fight ever took place.

3) ( Possibly what happened and the theory I support) They were swept away.

Two of the keepers, went out to repair things during a storm. ( Why the hell go out in a storm you might ask? Well one of the men was fined five shillings. Do the inflation math, and it's like losing a week's, or even a month's groceries putting his own family ahead of his well-being) After they failed to return, MacArthur headed out to find them, but he too was swept out. 

The third theory is the most plausible, but of course, we probably will never know. Without their bodies as evidence, or any more evidence at the lighthouse relating to their disappearance, the mystery will still continue, and will most remain one of the most intriguing and perplexing mysteries out there.

I present to you a mystery with a possible answer. Charles Grayson Sudduth was a US Citizen last seen on the 3rd or March 2004 after his flight (United Airlines 0839) touched down in Sydney, Australia. No one has seen or heard from him since. Anyway, I was on the doe network this morning and I may of found a possible match. 995UMNSW was an unidentified male found on a hiking track near Echo Point in the Blue Mountains on the 4th of June 2004. He was wearing blue corduroy pants with a black belt, a bone-coloured jacket with checked lining, a red button-up cardigan, a blue button-up shirt and brown work boots. A pink and black backpack was found nearby. He was carrying $100, a gold key with the word Diamond written on it and a pack of chewing gum. The cause of death was most likely due to a fall. Here is why I think Charles Grayson Sudduth is 995UMNSW. Firstly the dates of when Charles went missing and 995UMNSW was found are only about a month apart. Secondly, It makes sense for Charles to be at echo point since the blue mountains are a popular tourist destination which lots of walking track. The tracks can become very steep and slippery when wet and it is not hard to imagine a inexperienced tourist to fall while walking on a track. I can say this myself as someone who lives some what near the location. There are many news stories of tourist getting stuck on hiking tracks in and around this area in question and having to get air lifted to safety. This information is supported by a forum thread I found which points out the same information I just presented to you.

My theory is the Charles being a tourist with many similarities to John Doe decided to take a walk on a track near echo point. However these tracks can become steep and slippery with sheer drops, He lost his balance somehow (possibly taking a picture with a camera?) and fell to his death. He was not found to a month later when is body was so badly decomposed so that only bones were found and without identification he was unidentifiable.

Tell me what you think about this theory.

Have a great day, u/SpaceBurn_

706,lc1320,[],1635721068,"**BACKGROUND**

In Spring 1998, Hiroko Nemoto was close to finishing her bachelor's degree at Michigan State University, in East Lansing, Michigan. Only 10 credits away from her degree, she had just finished the spring semester, and was very close to graduating. Reports differ on what she was studying - the Doe Network and the National Missing Persons Directory both say she was studying English, although the Charley Project says that she was a psychology major, and goes on further to say that she told a friend she was not going to return to school the next semester, despite being so close to finishing her degree, because she believed it would only lead to employment in research, and not clinical psychology, the area where she wanted to work.   


Regardless of her major, she was supposed to return to Japan for the summer break in classes on June 3, 1998. Her friend (unnamed in official reports) and her friend's husband took her to dinner shortly beforehand, where she - a straight-A student - was upset about receiving a B in one of her classes in the past semester. This same friend also said that she had sold the majority of her clothing and personal belongings in early June, and given away many of her Japanese mementos.   


&amp;#x200B;

**DISAPPEARANCE**

On June 3, 1998, Hiroko Nemoto left Lansing, Michigan, on a flight. However, instead of traveling to Japan, as was expected, she took a Northwest Airlines flight to Anchorage, Alaska, which she had purchased a one-way ticket to. While she told another friend that she planned to stay in Alaska for a month, she never told her family in Japan about her trip to Alaska, despite phoning them weekly.    


She spent her first night in Alaska - June 4, 1998 - at the Denali Windsong Lodge, according to the National Missing Persons Directory. I could find no record of any Denali Windsong Lodge, however, there is a Seward Windsong Lodge, in Seward, AK, and a Denali Earthsong Lodge, in Healy, AK, but I don't know how long either have been open for. From there, she traveled to Denali National Park, near Mount McKinley, and then returned to Anchorage.  


Once she returned to Anchorage, she spent the night of the 5th in a youth hostel at 700 H Street. She'd made reservations for June 6th for a ferry from Whittier to Valdez, and had a reservation at the Westmark Hotel in Valdez, but Nemoto never showed up for either. The National Missing Persons Directory says that the tickets were ""used"", but it is unclear what this means. The Charley Project also indicates that she purchased a ticket for a train from Anchorage to Whittier, and then references the ferry from Whittier to Valdez, but doesn't make note of when they were purchased, and says that it's unclear whether she arrived at her destination  


On June 7th, 1998, Nemoto traveled from Anchorage, to Wasilla, a town about 50 miles north of Anchorage.  She spent the night of June 8 in the Windbreak Hotel, in Wasilla, and had breakfast with a man that she met on the morning of June 9. He then drove her to the bus station so she could catch a bus to Denali National Park, and has not been seen or heard from again.  


**INVESTIGATION**

Hiroko Nemoto's mother, who still lives in Ibaraki, contacted the Japanese consulate in Michigan about a month after Nemoto arrived in Alaska. The consulate then contacted East Lansing police, who found out about the ticket to Alaska, and then began the investigation, contacting Alaskan police to aid in the efforts.  


**THEORIES**

The main theories are either suicide, or foul play. Considering her distress over receiving a grade that she didn't find satisfactory, as well as the possibility she was unhappy about her future career path, it seems likely. While a B in a class may not seem like a big deal to many, to a straight A student like Nemoto, who was likely already stressed out and unhappy about other factors, it may have been positively world-ending. Additionally, she didn't tell her family in Japan about this trip, for unknown reasons, and selling/giving away one's belongings, especially personal effects, are warning signs for suicide. Nemoto's friend who she went to dinner with said that it seemed like Nemoto was trying to forget about Japan during that summer, though the context of that comment has not been revealed.  


Foul play is also a possibility. Nemoto was 36, though she does look younger. She could easily have fallen victim to someone looking for a vulnerable young woman, and considering the month gap between when she was last seen and reported missing, anything could have happened to her. It's also entirely possible that even if she did intend to commit suicide, she was then met with foul play.   


Regardless, her body has yet to be recovered. 

&amp;#x200B;

**FINAL NOTES**

Today, Hiroko Nemoto would be 59 if she's still alive. She's Japanese, 5'6, with black hair and brown eyes, and at the time of her disappearance, weighed 110 pounds. She's considered endangered missing, and her case is still being actively investigated by the Alaska State Troopers  


**FINAL NOTES AND SOURCES**

Several of the sources conflict on Nemoto's last known movements, making it difficult to ascertain where she was last, and where she disappeared from.

for those not familiar with selene delgado, she was a 18 year old mexican woman who became a urban legend after appearing on a canal 5 broadcast for missing persons (https://youtu.be/E7dh3LgnVPs the broadcast is here) people were weirded out by her seemingly generic facial features, bad camera quality and lack of detail the reporter gives (he only says shes 18  apparently but i cant verify since i dont speak spanish)

however, in the depths of the internet buried under all the conspiracy theories i found a blogspot with some actual information barely anyone seems to have touched upon. Here is the link https://adiosagorafobia.blogspot.com/2021/02/selene-delgado.html?m=1

Some interesting info that isnt in the broadcast from a translation

-the names on selenes mother and sister are listed as doña Esperenza Lopez and laura delgado

-selene dissapeared in delagacion Alvaro Obregon

-their was a phone number connected to her case thats now inactive and was from the corner store

-selene came from a poor family (already suspected by many)

-The photograph was printed with better quality on some printed media.

-The shopkeeper received a call, although he never gave details to the public until the day of his death.

-There is a blog on the internet with limited access (all its content is non-index) from 2006 where a group of people are in charge of investigating several cases of disappearances in Mexico, which investigated the case with 20 entries about the case with verifiable information

some unverifiable information this team from 2006 heard:

-selene dissapeared in the morning

-he had a stalker who lived to some streets. (Probably a translation error but im not sure wether the he refers to selene or the corner storekeeper)

-Selene Delgado's father died when she was a child.

-the mother washed someone else to survive.

-The day Selene Delgado disappeared, a woman known as Alondra disappeared, who was dedicated to prostitution on the streets of the Delgado Lopez house and who was the main suspect although she was never seen again.

-According to the blog's research, Selene left of her own free will.

Ok so im wondering

-Where do i find this blog from 2006?

-who is/was alondra?

-are there any archives of selenes photo in better quality that this post talks about?

710,ssuavelee,[],1635667601,"Robert William Pickton, aka “Willy” was a quiet Canadian man who grew up in a family of pig farmers. His family had been in the business of pig farming for three generations but by the time Pickton and his siblings inherited the pig farm, they’d only raise a few pigs on the farm and sell them to friends and neighbors.
They, in fact, sold parts of the inherited land for large sums of money, not having much intention of continuing the family business.
However, it wasn’t pig farming that made Willy rather infamous in Canada and the rest of the world. He is known to have murdered as many as 49 women, having been arrested due to his admitted “sloppiness” in trying to make his tally an “even 50” or the “big five-O.”

A Contradicting Tale of Quiet Nature and Rave Parties

Willy was described by most of his friends as a pretty “quiet and simple guy” who didn’t really have any visible devious habits that would draw much attention. He wasn’t known to be much of a drinker, or didn’t really do any substance abuse, nor was he ever known to be too violent.
After neglecting the original pig farming business inherited from their parents, Willy and his siblings registered a non-profit charity by the name of “The Piggy Palace Good Times Society” with the Canadian government in 1996. They claimed to “organize, co-ordinate, manage and operate special events, functions, dances, shows, and exhibitions on behalf of service organizations, sports organizations, and other worthy groups”. What these not-for-profit events eventually ended up being were a series of rave parties where members of music bands and other partygoers would come and engage in substance abuse and also engage with many sex workers. The events were quite large and attracted as many as 2,000 people.
After some complaints about the nature of activities held under the name of the charity, and some ruckus created at a New Year’s Eve party in 1998, police intervened and banned any future parties at the pig farm, and also stripped the non-profit status of the society in the following year for lack of sufficient financial statements.

The Murders &amp; The Discovery

In March 1997, Willy was first charged for the attempted murder of a sex worker called Wendy, who had been stabbed several times following an argument at the farm.
Wendy had managed to grab the weapon off Willy, stabbed him back, and escaped despite being handcuffed by him. Pickton received treatment at a nearby hotel and was also later released on bail. The charges were dismissed in January of 1998.
It was later that year that the injunction was brought to the farm and the charity to host any events and parties.
One of the workers at the farm, Bill Hiscox, noted that many of the women that visited the farm eventually went missing and reported his suspicions to the local police.
In February of 2002, when the police visited the farm with a search warrant, they found multiple items belonging to the missing women. Willy and his brother David Pickton were arrested on charges of owning illegal weapons. While they were later released, police maintained surveillance on the brothers.
On further investigation, police suspected Willy of a series of murders of the various missing women, and over the course of the year, Willy was charged for a total of fifteen first-degree murders.
Over the next three years, by October of 2005, the tally of the first-degree murder charges had gone up to a staggering twenty-seven.
Excavations at the farm continued for over a whole year, and cost about $70mn — making it one of the most expensive investigations in Canada’s history.
The excavations revealed cut skulls, broken jaws, and other bodily remains of multiple women including the DNA of as many as 33 different women.


The Modus Operandi

While not a lot is known on the exact details of each murder, it is believed that Willy would engage the sex workers in sexual activities, and in the middle of the act, get upset at them by blaming them for petty thefts or other wrongdoings. He would then escalate the altercation and handcuff them, before stabbing them to death.
He would put the bodies through a wood chipper and feed them to his pigs. Some of the resulting bits of flesh were also mixed with pork mince and sold to friends and family as pork mince.

The Investigation and the Conviction

After his arrest in February 2002, and the thorough investigation that followed, the result was twenty-seven charges of murder.
However, Willy is believed to have admitted to an undercover officer during the investigation, that he had killed as many as 49 women, and that his arrest was a result of him being “sloppy” when going for his big 50th kill.
This confession was actually captured on tape by the undercover officer who posed as his cellmate.
He’s believed to have said,

“I was gonna do one more, make it an even 50. That’s why I was sloppy, I wanted one more. Make… make the big five-O.”

In the trial that began in January 2006, Willy pleaded “not guilty” of all twenty-seven charges but was eventually found guilty for six counts of murder and in December 2007, was sentenced to life with no chance of parole for at least twenty-five years.
This was the maximum punishment for second-degree murder — and equal to the sentence which would have been imposed for a first-degree murder conviction.

711,gayspeedracer,[],1635657580,"Ebby Steppach disappeared on October 25th, 2015, following a phone call with her brother where he claims she sounded ""disoriented."" Steppach indicated that she was outside of his house, but when he went outside, he did not see her. Her last words to him were ""I fucked up,"" and then the call ended. This is the last known contact anyone had with her.

In the days leading up to her disappearance, Ebby had accused four (publicly unknown) men of gang-raping her at a party and recording it on a cell phone. This incident was known to police, but no formal searches of their cell phones were performed at the time. 

On October 27th, 2015, Ebby Steppach's abandoned Volkswagen Passat was discovered in Chalamont Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, by a security guard who immediately called the police; however, after waiting for over two hours, no officers responded. When the car was still there the next day, the security guard called again, and officers arrived an hour later to identify the vehicle as Steppach's. It had an empty gas tank, a dead battery, and the key was still in the ignition. 

Several searches of Chalamont Park ensued in the days following, but nothing was found in the area. While performing a private search with her daughter, Margie Foley — a Steppach family friend — alerted authorities to the smell of decomposition near the parking lot where Steppach's car was found. Though officers did arrive, they dismissed her immediately, claiming the area had been recently searched by canines and that it ""must be an animal or something.""

On May 24, 2018, two-and-a-half years after Steppach's disappearance, her skeletal remains were discovered in a drainage pipe just 60 feet from the spot where her car was discovered. The area was only re-searched thanks to the sheer gut instinct of Tommy Hudson, a new detective on the case, who thought that Steppach's body could have potentially been ""washed into the pipe"" by heavy rains that occurred in the days following her disappearance. In order to recover her remains, heavy equipment (such as a bulldozer) was necessary. 

Though there has been almost no development in recent years, a new investigator was assigned to her case in October 2021.

For over a decade, an unidentified serial pooper targeted Stavanger golf club in Norway. 

The poopetrator would arrive on a bicycle, defecate into a golf hole on the course, &amp; then disappear into the night on his bicycle.  He only struck on Weekdays, but groundskeepers found feces near the golf course accompanied by toilet paper on weekends.  He likes some golf holes more than others as well.

The employees at the golf course are confident that the poopetrator is a man based on the size of the excrement.  The pooper’s motive is also unknown, but the theories are that he either hates golf, has a fetish, or suffers from mental problems.

Groundskeepers tried to prevent him from pooping on their golf course by installing high-powered stop lights, however, the pooper climbed a tree next to the lights, moved far-enough out on a branch, &amp; dismantled the lights before pooping in another golf hole.  The poopetrator started in 2005 &amp; the last incident was in 2015.

The authorities realized that they were dealing with a human when they kept finding toilet paper near the crime scene.  In an attempt to catch the culprit, the authorities set up a motion detector &amp; two floodlights near the water tower, as well extra patrol &amp; a deputy stationed nearby, but to no avail.

The ""Devious Defecator"" was a serial pooper who's acts cost a company $2 Million.  Atlas Logistics was no different from any other grocery distributor in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time.  This was until one of its warehouses was plagued by a serial pooper.  Nicknamed ""The Devious Defecator"", this serial pooper kept pooping inside of one of the company's warehouses. 

 The company was fed up with this &amp; decided illegally to test the DNA of 2 of its employees who were thought to be the culprits by the company.   

After the 2 employees' found out about this, they sued the company for over $2,000,000 in the court case known as ""The Mystery of the Devious Defecator"".  The Company violated GINA laws enacted in 2008 for Genetic Privacy.  They won the case &amp; were rewarded with their money.   

And in case you were wondering, the employees' DNA did not match the fecal matter.

The Phantom Pooper dropped his or her bombs in the Invercargill Pool 6 times between March &amp; February of 2015, once every friday.  After the media got a hold of the case &amp; it made national headlines, the poopings stopped.  

There have been many theories about this case.  Some believe that the pooping was not malicious, but done by a kid.  The pool hosted a swimming &amp; water polo club for kids every Friday, it is believed by some that one  of the kids or potentially multiple in these clubs may have been the one to drop the bombs.

Students have been finding their clothes dirtier when they came out of the washing machine than they were before they went in.  A serial pooper has been targeting washing machines in the University of Southern Illinois.  

The pooper would strike the washing machines while clothes were inside, leading students to find their clothing covered in excrement.  

Some students have been targeted by the Bowel Movement Bandit more than once.  Erica Miller, who is a Sophomore,  has found excrement in his clothes on three separate occasions.

Although no motive has been established for the Bowel Movement Bandit, it is theorized by some that they may be targeted students who take too long to get their clothes out of the washer.

However, this Bowel Movement Bandit shouldn't be confused with the other Bowel Movement Bandit, who defecated on 19 Cars in Akron, Ohio.

# 7. The Mad Pooper

the Mad Pooper is possibly the most infamous serial pooper of all time.  She was active in Colorado Springs in 2017 during Summer.  

One family was her primary target, however she also struck various other homes &amp; even outside of a Walgreens.  

Her primary target was a family's property.   She was first caught pooping there by Cathy Budde, a resident of the home, in July.  Her children had told her that there was a woman outside of their home pooping.  Eager to see if her kids were serious, Cathy Budde went outside to see a woman squatting on her yard with her shorts around her ankles, pooping.  

The pooper apologized when she saw Cathy Budde stating ""Yeah, Sorry"".  She assumed that the Mad Pooper would clean up her mess, but she left it there.  

She would find poop in her yard once a week after their first encounter, often finding wipes &amp; towels the pooper used to wipe herself with.  

Other neighbors reported seeing her pooping on their property as well when talking to Budde about it.  

Budde decided to contact the police.  The police have found no suspects though, but say that she could be charged with indecent exposure &amp; public defecation, as well as being registered as a sex offender.  

Two theories have emerged about the Mad Pooper.  The first is that she has a medical problem that made her need to poop.  The other theory is that she is an exhibitist with bad impulse control.

To me, the latter seems more likely.  There were numerous bathrooms near a park &amp; a gas station where she was jogging &amp; she could have easily used those.  If she couldn't reach those bathrooms in time, she could have found a more secluded place to do her business, not in front of children.  The act was also obviously premeditated, as evidence by her wiping herself after the crime.

The Mad Pooper was also seemingly the inspiration for [The Orchard Park Pooper](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/orchard-park-mystery-pooper_n_5a3155bde4b01bdd76594464), another unidentified serial pooper who was active in New York in 2017 who had a similar M.O to the Mad Pooper.

BOSTON (AP) — A convicted sex offender is being charged in the killing of a woman whose body was found in the basement of a Boston building more than three decades ago, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins.
Richard Vega, 59, faces a murder charge and is set to be arraigned in Suffolk Superior Court this month. He is already being held after a jury previously determined he was sexually dangerous, Prosecutors say DNA evidence linked Vega to the 1988 killing of 21-year-old Judy Chamberlain, whose body was found in a building in what is now Boston's Seaport neighborhood. Police found that she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.

Vega was identified as a suspect in 2011 after a federal database matched his DNA profile to evidence from the 1988 killing, according to Rollins' office, but prosecutors at the time did not think they had enough evidence to bring chargee Vega had been required to submit a DNA sample after he was convicted of rape in a 1987 attack on an elderly woman in Revere.
Vega was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for the 1987 attack, and a jury in 2008 found that he was sexually dangerous and should remain at a corrections facility

Investigators recently collected new evidence in the case allowing them to bring the case to a Suffolk County grand jury, prosecutors said. A jury returned an indictment Aug. 30 charging Vega with Chamberlain’s murder.
It was not immediately clear if Vega has obtained an attorney for the case.
“Ms. Chamberlain’s family has been waiting 33 years for answers,” Rollins said in a statement. “We were finally able to offer those answers some three decades later. Ms. Chamberlain’s life mattered.”

The investigation got fresh attention from authorities as part of a recent effort to solve Boston-area cold cases dating to the 1960s. Rollins started the initiative, known as the Project for Unsolved Suffolk Homicides, when she took office in 2019.
The effort has led to murder indictments in two other killings, from 1995 and 1980, according to the district attorney's office.",Sex offender being charged in slaying of woman 3 decades ago
716,articlesarestupid,[],1635635050," In 1972, a black 14 year old girl named Marialice Clark vanished from her native Omaha, Nebraska. There isn’t much out there on her case, aside from an old post written by her brother. This is what her brother, Ed Clark, wrote at that time and is a good summary of the case: “In July of 1970, when I was 15-years old, my 12-year old sister Marialice Clark was named as the informant on an affidavit for a search warrant to raid the Omaha headquarters of a group called the National Committee to Combat Fascism, an off-shoot of the Black Panther Party. The chapter headquarters was near our house. We could see their back porch from our front porch. Our older sister Linda dated the head of the NCCF, Ed Poindexter. The young men who were members of the NCCF were a part of the neighborhood. We had no fear of them. Unbeknown to anyone, an ATF Agent named Tom Sledge claimed my baby sister saw 10 boxes of machine guns with six guns in each box inside the NCCF. He said she described the guns so accurately he knew they were AK-47s. He also claimed Marialice saw 15 bundles of dynamite with 12 sticks to the bundle inside the house. He said that five men-- some of whom I knew-- made a bomb out of dynamite in front of my sister. I do not believe that is true. Sledge never told our mother that he put my sister's name on his affidavit-- and he spelled her first name wrong as""Mary Ellis,"" making me wonder if he even met her.  


Based on his affidavit, the ATF was granted a search warrant to raid the NCCF. However, the Omaha FBI had an informant in the chapter and they knew the information in the affidavit was false. An FBI agent contacted the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice around July 21, 1970 and asked that it intervene to stop the raid. The DOJ told a U.S. Attorney in Omaha it did not want a repeat of the raid in Chicago that killed Black Panthers Mark Clark and Fred Hampton in December 1969. ATF agent Tom Sledge was told to return the search warrant to the judge unserved. Marialice never told anyone that she had met an ATF agent, and she never told anyone that she saw machine guns, dynamite or men making bombs at the NCCF.  


Two years later, in August of 1972, Marialice disappeared. She was never seen again. My mother petitioned the court to declare her dead in 1980, never knowing Marialice had been named as Tom Sledge's informant.  


In 1997, my mother received a copy of the ATF affidavit. From the time she learned that Marialice was named on that affidavit, she wondered if Marialice was in a witness protection program. But, how could a 14-year old be put in a witness protection program without informing her mother? How could a 12-year old be named as an informant without telling her mother? Especially if she truly saw such dangerous things.  


Please join me in asking President Obama to direct the Attorney General and the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to investigate ATF Agent Tom Sledge and the Omaha ATF records from 1970 to determine if my sister was a victim of the nationwide effort to eliminate the Black Panther Party. It is a crime to lie on an affidavit. Sledge should have been investigated and fired in 1970 over this affidavit. Everything Sledge did to investigate an August 1970 bombing that was blamed on the NCCF should be also be questioned and investigated. He may have fabricated evidence to convict two innocent men for a crime they did not commit.  


Marialice wasn't a militant. She was a school girl. How would you feel if this happened to your sister?”  
This is one of the strangest cases I’ve come across as it is, but it turns out that as this case was researched for possibly the first time ever, things got even stranger. Several months prior to Marialice’s disappearance she was repeatedly sexually assaulted and bravely escaped and called the police, who never investigated her heinous victimization. The police records have been obtained by someone on Facebook researching her case and are posted in that group. The fact that the investigation part of the police report is left completely blank is simply horrific. But did any of this really happen? We don’t know. We do know that in July 1980, Marialice’s mother, Mary Clark, petitioned the Douglas County courts to have Marialice declared deceased. Ready for the plot twist? There was not one, but two life insurance policies on Marialice. No one knows if those polices were ever cashed out or executed, or if the death petition was signed off on by a judge.   
On Monday, November 1 a popular true crime podcast will be covering Marialice’s story for the first time. No other media outlet has told her story in the past, except for the one Reddit post that was in this sub about a year ago where OP claimed to be investigating Marialice’s case. That post seems to have been deleted, but if anyone can recover it, here’s the link, I’d love to see it. The person who wrote it commented specifically that Marialice was not in witness protection, but who names a 12 year old in an ATF affidavit? Do 12 year olds even know what the ATF is?: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/iznxwn/in\_1970\_a\_young\_black\_girl\_was\_named\_as\_a\_federal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/iznxwn/in_1970_a_young_black_girl_was_named_as_a_federal/)  
Aside from the petition and the deleted Reddit post, there has been a group created recently dedicated to spreading Marialice’s story. I’ll link it under the sources as well.   
Questions:  
Is it possible Marialice is out there alive and doesn’t know who she is?   
Was she so traumatized she has no recollection of her identity?   
Did someone want to kill her?   
Did she really talk to the ATF?  
Why hasn’t her case ever been investigated?   
Was she declared deceased?  
What happened to those life insurance policies and who would take out two on a teenager, in the 70s?  
From the looks of the social media group, the Omaha Police Department doesn’t want anyone finding her, which makes this case one of the weirdest missing persons cases of all time in my book.   
If you’d like to join the group on social media, search for “findingmarialice”

Because Pioneer Press has an absolutely unforgiving paywall: 

--------------------

Bob Hamburge should have been joining his Cretin High School 50th reunion this fall — the gathering delayed a year because of the pandemic. But instead, some of his classmates were thinking of a way to still find answers for him and his family.

It was 50 years ago that Hamburge was killed in St. Paul when he was a 19-year-old University of Minnesota student.

Now, with a $10,000 reward fund raised by his high school classmates and police taking another look at the homicide, Hamburge’s friends and family are hoping to bring closure to the cold case.

“We certainly understand this is somewhat of the needle in the haystack, as far as getting information, but there’s never a wrong time to do the right thing,” his brother, Mark Hamburge, said Friday.


Ed Cleary, a high school classmate of Hamburge’s and retired Minnesota Court of Appeals chief judge, said because so many years have passed, the person or people behind Bob Hamburge’s homicide may have died — but that doesn’t mean others don’t know what happened. People with credible information could be eligible for a monetary reward, Hamburge’s classmates said.

After reading a Pioneer Press article in August about Hamburge’s homicide, and his siblings who have dealt with the aftermath for 50 years, Annette Whaley asked her husband, John Whaley, if he thought a reward could shed new light on the case. Both Whaleys went to Holy Spirit Elementary in St. Paul with Bob Hamburge, and John was in his class at Cretin High School (now Cretin-Derham Hall).

JUSTICE FUND

Whaley and four of his Cretin classmates — Dave Ayers, Cleary, Mike Donnelly and David Eggenberger — took up the cause of promoting the Robert Hamburge Justice Fund at their high school reunion

There were 20 to 25 people who contributed to the fund from Hamburge’s class, along with people from Mark Hamburge’s Cretin class who are a year younger.

In making the announcement Friday, Hamburge’s relatives brought along mementos from his life. A Snoopy stuffed animal, which was the 10th birthday gift that Bob Hamburge gave his sister, Therese Celine Bartlett, the night before he was killed. A black and white photograph of Hamburge’s basketball team, which Mark was on and their father coached. A peace patch that Bob Hamburge wore on his jacket, his eyeglasses and his nametag from Cretin.


“We are hoping somebody has a conscience that … maybe was afraid to talk 50 years ago, 30 years ago,” Mark Hamburge said. “I believe somebody knows something.”

WHO KILLED BOB?

Bob Hamburg (Courtesy of the family)
It was around 1:45 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1971, when Bob Hamburge’s roommate was going to sleep and Hamburger told him he was going “for a little walk,” according to a police report.

“It was nothing unusual for Bob to walk around the block and have a smoke,” his brother, Jim Hamburge, said recently.

At 6:30 that morning, two youths were bicycling to work at the Como Zoo when they found Hamburge’s body at St. Albans Street and Pleasant Avenue, according to a newspaper article from the time.

He had left his wallet at his apartment at Laurel and Western avenues, which leads his family to believe he didn’t plan to be gone long.

Hamburge sustained major head injuries, among other wounds. On his finger was a 1970 Cretin High School class ring bearing his initials, RJH, which police used along with a school yearbook to identify him. His father had the grim task of going to the morgue to confirm it.

Sgt. Nichole Sipes, a St. Paul police homicide investigator, received the Hamburge case in the last week to take a renewed look at it, in conjunction with the reward that is being offered.

“Behind every cold case, there’s a family that’s looking for some justice and closure,” Sipes said Friday. “We always want to take a look at these cases, and see if we can find some conclusion for them.”

HOW TO HELP

People with information are asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477 or St. Paul police at 651-266-5650. Tips can be submitted anonymously, with people still eligible to receive a reward.

I'm very familiar with the area where this took place, and it both does and doesn't stand out to me for a variety of reasons. First of all, it's *extremely* upscale. There are some more affordable apartments here and there, like the one Bob lived in (which, if I'm thinking correctly, is still standing, albeit probably more bougie now, and I pass by it all the time). But we're talking multi-million dollar Victorian mansions with impeccable upkeep. I believe Summit Ave is one of the longest contiguous stretches of Victorian homes in the whole country. That doesn't mean it's 100% crime-free, but it's generally pretty quiet, and I imagine it wasn't very different 50 years ago. 

However, it's also a very dense area, and has a lot of main roads connecting to other parts of the city. Summit, Grand, Victoria, Western. Despite the barrier created by 35E to the south (which was completed by the time this murder took place), there are lots of ways to get in and out of this area. There's generally a lot of people coming and going, so it would be difficult to say if anyone saw or heard anything unusual. In fact, according to the other recent article about this story, a few people at the time did hear cries for help, but assumed it was just drunk rough-housing.

Overall, I think it's going to be a difficult case to crack without an eyewitness or solid confession. There's no DNA and no apparent motive or link to the victim.

I also recommend [the other recent Pioneer Press article](https://www.twincities.com/2021/08/07/robert-bob-hamburge-unsolved-homicide-st-paul/) about this case, if you can get around the paywall.

First post here and I'm on mobile. And I just can't write very well.

Laynee Westbrook, aged 41, went missing September 10th, 2020.

Laynee had been staying at the San Juan hotel, in Anacortes, Washington, since June. The hotel is known to locals as a hotspot for drugs and prostitution, but family say Laynee was not a drug user and was Employed at a local grocer and living there because of the affordable rent.

Laynee was seen on cctv leaving her apartment with a man (who's name has not been released by police, but through sleuthing I have found his name and that he received a 4 years prison sentence for assaulting and strangling a woman in '14) in his vehicle at 7:11 p.m. along with her dog in tow. The pair was later spotted at a local gas station on their way to spend the night at the man's rv where he had been living, on a nearby campgrounds.

The man states that he later dropped Laynee off, two blocks away from her hotel on the side of the street next to a park, between 2 and 3 a.m. https://i.imgur.com/EZ5DeUi.jpg

Laynee is never seen on security cameras or by persons, and never makes it back to her room. Her dog is also missing. Her debit card has not been used, and her cell phone was shut off sometime that night and has not been on since.

Police tip lines received reports that during the night, other campground residents heard a loud argument between a man and woman regarding a missing dog.

The campground the suspect in question lives on, is on a native american reservation, whether this has impeded on jurisdiction for searching is unclear, but locals report that they have not seen any police searches conducted at the rv she spent that last known night. 

Family and friends have conducted searches, unfruitfully, and are offering a $10,000 reward for information. 

Laynee is described as being 5’9” tall, weighs 120 lbs and has medium brown hair and hazel eyes. She was last seen wearing a black shirt, blue jeans and white sandals. Her dog, Precious, is a rat terrier and has a nub tail.

722,ssuavelee,[],1635587638,"On the first night of February 1959, nine ski-hikers died mysteriously in the mountains of what is now Russia. The night of the incident, the group had set up camp on a slope, enjoyed dinner, and prepared for sleep—but something went catastrophically wrong because the group never returned.
On February 26, searchers found the hikers’ abandoned tent, which had been ripped open from the inside. Surrounding the area were footprints left by the group, some wearing socks, some wearing a single shoe, some barefoot, all of which continued to the edge of a nearby wood. That’s where the first two bodies were found, shoeless and wearing only underwear. The scene bore marks of death by hypothermia, but as medical examiners inventoried the bodies, as well as the other seven that were discovered over the months that followed, hypothermia no longer made sense. In fact, the evidence made no sense at all. One body had evidence of a blunt force trauma consistent with a brutal assault; another had third-degree burns; one had been vomiting blood; one was missing a tongue, and some of their clothing was found to be radioactive.
Theories floated include KGB-interference, drug overdose, UFO, gravity anomalies, and the Russian version of the Yeti. Recently, a documentary filmmaker presented a theory involving a terrifying but real phenomenon called “infrasound,” in which the wind interacts with the topography to create a barely audible hum that can nevertheless induce powerful feelings of nausea, panic, dread, chills, nervousness, raised heartbeat rate, and breathing difficulties. The only consensus remains that whatever happened involved an overwhelming and possibly “inhuman force.”

# Timeline Of Events And Details 

**February 4th, 2018**

Tonya may have seen a murder four days before her death. Mother A.V. states, *""What she witnessed she couldn't get out of her mind."" -wgrz news*

Allegedly Tonya would consume drugs and would tell what she had seen to everyone around her. The rumor said this would happen until a hit order was made to silence her. The rumor goes on to say that Tonya was leaving the house for the store. A few men were there. Tonya hollered and screamed before she was shot multiple times. It's possible she yelled out I don't have your money or stuff.

Eire County District Attorney John Flynn who is investigating Tonya's case reports they are aware of the rumors. They officially announced that to date they do not know of any eyewitnesses of the event. Those that had come forward all got their information via rumor. The info came from various sources. 

There was a homicide on the day Tonya may have seen it. This homicide is still unsolved. It occurred on 134 Wick Street and the victim is Douglas Padre Johnson according to John Flynn. This victim was rumored to be a doorman for a drug house in Buffalo NY. In a news report, they say the victim's name is  Douglas E. Johnson but he was known by ""Padre"". Douglas was 47 years old. Discovered on February 6th, 2018 his body was snow-covered. After examination, it was found that he died of multiple stabbings. Wick street is also a dead-end street near Broadway and Bailey. Crimestoppers offered up to $2,500 and the Buffalo Police Department was offering up to $1,500 for information that leads to an arrest or indictment. Johnson's body was found the same night Tonya was killed and his body was three streets away from her death location.

Tonya has one last Facebook post and it was published on this day. It seems it was a food delivery check-in for skipthedishes. 

**February 6th, 2018 Evening 5-5:30 PM**

Tonya is shot multiple times on dead-end Shepard street near Broadway. The police arrive shortly after the event but Tonya is pronounced dead at the scene. 

Tonya's mother A.V. had worked a double shift. (16 hours) and was eager to get home that very cold day. Once at home she settles to watch television and the shows remind her of her daughter Tonya. One show was about a person promoting make-up and A.V. thought Tonya could do that! The show changes to something about angels and learning the signs to know if you were surrounded by them. Interrupting the moment was a banging on the door so loud it scared her. A.V. angrily looks out the window to see her son. Once inside he attempts to get her to sit but she refuses. A.V. says she is a stubborn mother like that. 

""He said they killed \[her\], and I said killed who? He said 'Boo' because we call, the family calls, Tonya 'Boo,' and I just immediately fell out. And I said, 'well' and cried for I don't know how long,"" -wgrz 

A.V. is in denial and is unable to process her daughter's death. Asking her son if he had seen Tonya himself she learns that he had not. The police had identified her via various markings and her tattoos. A.V. refused to believe Tonya was gone until she finally saw her. 

The news reports Tonya's death that night but initially misgenders her. 

**February 10th, 2018** 

The Buffalo News issues corrections about Tonya's gender. Michael J. DeGeorge the Buffalo Police spokesman announced they were looking into some early leads.

**February 11th or 12th, 2018** 

A.V. verifies and see's her daughter's body at the funeral home after Tonya's body was cleaned and prepared by the funeral home. 

**February 12th, 2018** 

Tonya's wake was held at 11:00 am at TL Pickens Mortuary 66 E. Utica Street Buffalo, NY 14209. The funeral service was held the same day and place at 12:00 PM. 

Prior to Tonya's death her mother A.V. and talked about what Tonya would want if she died early. The question arose because A.V. was worried about her daughter's lifestyle. Tonya simply told her mother ""Mom, whatever makes you happy."" - dailypublic.com  

**February 8th, 2018- through the following week. (Estimated)**

The Erie County District Attorney investigates the homicide to see if it was a hate crime. Tonya's death brings about a lot of media attention. During this time era, an upswing of hate crimes against trans people climb.

# Crime Scene 

Tonya suffered multiple gunshots. Allegedly it was six wounds total to the head, chest, back, bottom and genitals. The information about the wounds was not given by the police but by the funeral director. -dailypublic There were 9-millimeter shells on the ground in the vicinity of Tonya's body. 

The district attorney's office has acknowledged the gunshot wounds. They were asked if the location of the wounds indicated a hate crime. *""It could potentially be"" or it could mean the perpetrator was a ""bad shot.""* \- dailypublic They later ruled that Tonya's murder was not a hate crime. 

A.V. says that as a mother she imagines her daughter was trying to run away or turn around. 

It is unclear what significance this location was to Tonya. The news reports that she had no permanent address at this point in her life. Tonya's facebook indicates that she was a regular around in this area. In some of her Facebook lives, she goes to the same store by her accounts daily and people would drive by her and say hi. According to family, Tonya used supportive housing. 

In news video segments you can see the investigation happening. The neighborhood is a tightly packed residential with a narrow road.  There was snow-packed onto the streets and the LE wore heavy clothing. The area seems slightly worn but with efforts to upkeep. During the clips the police cross caution tape and go down into an ally between the houses. 

The scene is Shepard Street, a dead-end off-broadway and two blocks from bailey avenue. The area near broadway and bailey is known for gun violence. 2018 was a particularly deadly year. Here is s a list of sources of the areas murders for 2018.

# Tonya Harvey  

Tonya Harvey, with her own words, used an ""AKA"" which is why some may know her as Kita Harvey. Pronounced Kee-Tah. Family would call her Boo. Others still gave her nicknames like ""Freckles"" or ""The black Cameron Diaz."" Tonya may have used other AKA's but it seemed like she wanted to be known as Tonya or Kita the most. 

Tonya was born to father M.H. and mother A.V. and was 35 years old when she died on February 6th, 2018 about 5:00 pm in Buffalo NY. Tonya has at least one younger brother by six years. Along with many extended friends that were family by choice with her. 

As a child, Tonya lived in Ferry-Grinder homes (Donovan Drive). This was not a good place for her and she was bullied regularly. Other children would use homophobic slurs and physically attack her. Parents would go out of their way to tell Tonya's mother that her child was gay. A.V. would disagree with them saying; *""I was like, \[she's\] a kid \[she\] should be able to do what \[she\] want to do.""* 

A.V. knew she had to get Tonya and her younger brother out of that area after seeing the bullying. First, they went to an apartment on Burgard street and then into a home on Bailey-Kensington. A.V. worked as a nursing assistant for the New York State Department of Corrections for nearly 20 years.  

Tonya grew up in Buffalo and attended Lafayette Highschool. Tonya like all teens was a little rebellious and would sneak out of the house. Sometimes she went to Club Marcella and other times to the hair salon on main street. 

The main street salon was an important place. There she met her friend and mentor V.M. and they had a strong relationship as father and daughter. Tonya would call V.M. dad and he would advocate and help her. V.M. would talk to Tonya's mother who struggled with her faith and her daughter's identity. V.M now owns his own hair salon on main street called *Garth Beauty*. 

*""Honestly I gravitated towards Kita because so many people in the community kind of did not like her. She was a lot to deal with. At that time, I felt I could take her underneath my wing before somebody really hurts her,"" - The Public*

Once she graduated high school Tonya attempted to join the armed forces. However, she wasn't eligible and found out she had a medical condition that could be life-threatening. 

Tonya transitioned in her twenties. Then she enjoyed traveling around the country visiting places like Alaska, California, and Atlanta. Tonya lived outside of Atlanta for a short period of time. 

Throughout her life, Tonya was spiritual and optimistic. According to her mother, she had been a faithful Christian throughout her whole life. This trait uplifted those around her. 

Tonya experienced life hardships and used drugs. A.V. attempted to help by giving her daughter consequences such as not being allowed to live with her but she still would check on her. A.V. would get off work and would scour the streets looking for her daughter. Often she would have to check abandoned houses. Tonya also engaged in sex work for survival. Tonya went through rehab for drugs and would focus on poetry and creativity to get her through. Drugs and sex work were an on-and-off cycle for her. 

Tonya had encountered violence before. Confiding in her mother Tonya tells of her hardships. In New York, she survived an encounter with a man who tied her up and threatened her with a gun. Then near a hotel along Niagra Falls Boulevard, she was robbed by people she knew. 

Tonya's family thinks that drugs contributed to her death. The more she used the drugs the less and less they would see of her. At the time of her death, nobody knew who she had been around in those last few days.  

 One week before her death Tonya visited her adopted father V.M. at the Salon. 

""Dad just wanted to say I love you and I need to use the bathroom."" -dailypublic.com 

V.M. said that he replied, ""I love you too and be safe."" 

Tonya was beautiful and was considered a ""show-stopper"" when it came to pageants and shows. Tonya and her friend E.M.J. were inspired by the documentary ""Paris Is Burning."" Tonya would walk for ballroom fashion competitions but her talent was best in cabaret-style shows. Tonya even made and designed her own clothing and outfits. The shows that she did would support LGBTQ+ 

Tonya would inspire young trans people and was a trailblazer in the community. Consistently, she could be relied upon to help people.  Tonya's friend A.M and LGBTQ+ advocate said Tonya never did wrong to people. When life was hard for her she reached out to others by paying off their bills and buying needed items. A.V. was impressed with her daughter's ability to forgive others. Tonya's father now deceased would steal from the family to buy drugs. This father was also physically violent with the family and yet graceful Tonya forgave him. 

Tonya was a precious jewel with a shining and valuable personality. This world is at a loss without her in it. Tonya's talents were immeasurable being able to sing, dance, write, perform, design, model, and be kind. This woman was creative with infinite possibilities. Tonya was passionate, outgoing, and a bit loud in the best way possible. 

Tonya had wanted to become a public speaker so that she could share her story. Mother A.V. says in the future she may publish some of Tonya's written works. 

# Motives

Tonya was well-loved and liked and because of this, it has led to speculation on who could want her dead. 

Hate crime is the most popular motive theory. During 2018 there was an upswing in hate crimes against trans people across the country. Tonya had been the third trans person to be murdered in America in less than a month. LE ruled out a hate crime as a motive but the theory still exists among close friends and family. 

**Anyone that could kill her daughter in that manner was driven by hate said A.V.** 

Then there is the silenced for talking about a murder she witnessed theory. 

Then she was killed for something related to drugs or sex work theory. 

# Similar Cases 

Buffalo, N.Y. on the same block a 19-year-old man was shot early Monday morning on Feb. 19, 2018. The event took place around 1 am. https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/news/2018/02/19/police-investigating-possible-shooting-on-shepard-street

Tonya was the third or fourth known transgender person to be killed in 2018 according to GLAAD reports. 

Then according to dailypublic.com Tonya's homicide was the first in the year. In 2017 there were three homicides on New Years Day alone. 

Then on the same day of her death, the murder that Tonya may have witnessed was found. Stabbed to death multiple times only three streets away from Tonya's murder. The victim was Douglas E. Johnson AKA ""Padre"" and he was found snow-covered in the street. 

**“I want her death to mean something,” -A.V.**

Somebody knows something. There is no way that Tonya was murdered in the street of that neighborhood without a witness. I urge that witness to come forward or provide anonymous information to Crimestoppers or directly to Buffalo police. It's possible you could earn reward money through Crimestoppers. You can remain anonymous and still earn reward money. Tonya had routines that she followed and people would say hello to her in the street. Somebody saw something. 

https://www.crimestopperswny.org/ or https://www.bpdny.org/155/Report-a-Tip

If you are unable to provide witness to this crime you can still support Tonya's case. Share her story! It doesn't need to be this writing. All that matters is that you honor her name and her story somehow. Most traditional news sources took her story and sensationalized it without actually trying to get her closure and justice. Fix that today! 

Take a moment to write to the district attorney office of buffalo and tell them to keep looking into Tonya's murder. We demand it to be solved. https://www2.erie.gov/da/index.php?q=contact

So what's everyone's thoughts on him getting parole? And do you think he's a changed man?
Do you think that now he's spent so much time in prison that he will be worse than before he went in? But I guess he was only a child himself when he went to prison. So my worry is that prison has basically brought him up and shaped who he is today? Which isn't gunna be a good thing. 
And I know everyone deserves a chance, yes I understand that but I'm just worried what kind of person prison has made him into?
And also I guess it will feel strange for him once he's out n about as he's definitely not used to it as he's spent his whole life in there! Getting told what to do. Getting told when to eat, when to go the toilet, when to speak. It's gunna be a hard road ahead for him as he's gunna have to re learn everything. I dunno 🤷🏼‍♀️, what's your thoughts?","He will be out soon, so just thought everyone would like to know?"

726,milehighmystery,[],1635566811,"Tina Marie Janose was born on February 15, 1968, and grew up in Polk County, Florida. Her maternal family had deep roots in the area and lived in central Florida for over two decades. Tina’s parents divorced in 1979 and her father moved to Michigan. 

In 1981, 13-year-old Tina was living with her mother and two younger siblings in the small town of Wahneta, FL. She was in the eighth grade at Dennison Junior High School, where she played the flute in the school band. She was described as “one of the sweetest girls in the neighborhood”, with a big heart and a strong love for animals. 

On the afternoon of Friday, October 30, 1981, Tina walked home from Dennison Junior High School and met her 7-year-old brother, Chet, on the way to the family’s mobile home on Spires Road. She spent the afternoon in the backyard, taking care of her beloved pet rabbits. It wasn’t uncommon for a stray cat or raccoon to try to get into the rabbit hutch, so Tina spent a lot of her free time making sure her rabbits remained safe and cared for. 

Later that evening, Tina’s mother, Laguan, arrived home with one of Tina’s favorite meals for dinner; a bucket of fried chicken from Kentucky Fried Chicken. Laguan’s boyfriend, Jimmie, also joined the family and ended up staying the night. Laguan and Jimmie usually slept in the room located on one side of the mobile home, while the children slept in their rooms on the other side. Tina shared a room with her 3-year-old sister, Lisa.

After finishing dinner, the family watched horror movies in the living room. It wasn’t uncommon for Tina and her brother to stay up late over the weekend and fall asleep in the living room instead of their bedrooms. This Friday night before Halloween was no exception and the family watched movies, ate junk food, and discussed plans for the next day’s Halloween festivities. 

Sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. on Saturday, October 31, the family finished the scary movie marathon and Tina kissed her mother good-night. This is the last confirmed sighting of Tina, and the last time Laguan saw her daughter alive.

At 7 a.m., Laguan woke up to the sound of her daughter, Lisa, crying in the living room. Laguan got Lisa up and took her to Tina’s room so Lisa could snuggle with her big sister. When Laguan opened the bedroom door, she made the horrible realization that her daughter was not in her bed. She frantically searched the home, but could not find Tina anywhere. She continued searching the area while Jimmie went outside and looked in the backyard, but Tina was nowhere to be found. Laguan went back inside her home and called the police at 7:20 a.m. to report her daughter missing.

**The Murder**

[trigger warning; crimes against children]

The Polk County Sheriff’s Office had already received one distressing phone call when Laguan Janose called on Halloween morning. 

Around 7 a.m., a motorist called the police department from a truck stop after making a gruesome discovery on Interstate 4 in north-central Polk County, twelve miles away from Tina’s home. Laying face down beneath the roadway in the middle of the eastbound lane was the badly beaten body of a young teenage girl. The partially nude body was found 100 feet away from the Mount Olive Road overpass that connects to I-4 and crosses Polk City. There were indications the body had been thrown over the concrete overpass down to the road below. Clothing was wrapped tightly around the neck, leading first responders to believe she had been strangled. 

By 8 a.m., detectives were at Laguan’s home with photographs of the body. When Laguan saw the images, she started sobbing and fainted. According to one of Laguan’s neighbors who was helping search for Tina when the police arrived, the deceased girl in the photographs was beaten in the face and on the upper body. The neighbor told *The Ledger*, “she was beaten so bad, you could see her bones.” 

Although Laguan was confident the deceased girl in the photographs was Tina, police needed a relative to make an identification. Due to her distraught emotional state, Laguan’s brother, Junior Reynolds, accompanied police to the morgue at the Lakeland General Hospital. Junior confirmed that the body was his 13-year-old niece, Tina Marie Janose. 

The autopsy upheld law enforcement’s original theory that Tina had been strangled, and the coroner declared the official cause of death as ligature strangulation. Tina’s hands had been tied behind her back and her nightgown was found near her body. Authorities declined to comment on the condition of the clothes or the clothing found around her neck. The coroner speculated that she had been killed sometime between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. that morning. The autopsy also concluded that Tina had been sexually assaulted, although the rape test was “inconclusive”.

No clues were found in the home and police had no suspects in the murder. However, they quickly assumed Tina may have known her attacker and left the home willingly since there were no signs of a break-in. A search of the trailer found that the back door was unlocked on the morning of the disappearance. This door always remained locked, and Laguan was adamant she would have locked it behind her after coming home earlier that evening. 

Laguan was also positive her daughter would not have left in the middle of the night, or at least, not willingly. Laguan told *The Herald Tribune* in 2003 that because there was no sign of forced entry and the back door was unlocked, Tina possibly went outside sometime during the night. She theorized Tina may have heard a noise outside, thought it was an animal in the rabbit hutch, and got up to go check on her rabbits. Laguan believes after Tina was outside, somebody approached her and did not “cause her alarm”. She also pointed out that Tina had Halloween plans on Saturday night that she was looking forward to and would not have willingly missed.

Tina’s funeral was held at her church in Wahneta that November. Laguan’s neighbors and many members of the small community pitched in for Tina’s funeral expenses and helped Junior open a fund in her name. Tina was buried in a blue casket, wearing her favorite blue dress, at Lakeside Cemetery in Winter Haven. 

Laguan moved her family out of the trailer in early 1982, saying there were too many painful memories in their home and the family needed a fresh start. 

**The Suspects**

James Norman Ulmer was the first suspect to emerge on law enforcement radar. In 1982, the 24-year-old was living in Lakeland, and frequently burglarized homes in his neighborhood. He also spent his time peeping through the windows of unsuspecting residents. 

On June 20, 1982, Ulmer drove to Kathleen, a town 45 minutes north of Wahneta. He parked his 1976 maroon Camaro in a quiet neighborhood and crept across the lawn of a small mobile home. Ulmer removed the screen from the bottom window, climbed inside, and abducted an 11-year-old girl named Lisa.  Ulmer forced Lisa into his Camaro and drove her around the county for hours. When he reached an overpass near I-4, Ulmer pulled over, grabbed Lisa, and drug her out of the car. He then proceeded to push Lisa over the side of the overpass, where she fell 24-feet onto the ground below. Ulmer then fled the scene. 

Incredibly, Lisa survived the fall. She suffered a broken pelvis, fractured wrist, and broken fingers.  The overpass where Lisa was thrown over was north of Lakeland on Old Combee Road, thirteen miles from where Tina was found on I-4. 

Lisa was able to identify James Norman Ulmer as her kidnapper. She remembered several details about his vehicle, including the beads hanging on the rearview mirror, and a large dent on the side. Fingerprints belonging to Ulmer were found on the railing in front of the overpass. Lisa also told police that Ulmer never tried to sexually assault her and never touched her in a sexual manner during the ordeal. 

On November 5, 1982, one year after Tina was murdered, a six-member jury found James Norman Ulmer guilty of kidnapping and attempted murder. A month later, he was sentenced to 80 years in prison. He was also tried and convicted the same year for an unrelated trespassing incident in Wahneta. 

Similarities in Lisa’s attack prompted detectives to question Ulmer about any involvement in Tina Janose’s murder. Following his conviction, detectives tried to interview Ulmer, but he refused to speak to investigators and never commented on any of his crimes. He died in 1996 while receiving treatment for respiratory problems in a prison hospital. 

It would be over a decade before investigators named another person of interest in Tina’s case.

—

In December 1993, a man named Frank Potts Jr. was arrested in Kathleen for an outstanding warrant from Alabama. Frank Potts Jr. was a 50-year-old seasonal citrus laborer from Highland City in Polk County. He was charged with kidnapping a wildlife officer in Alabama in 1992 and was held without bail. 

While Frank Potts Jr. was in the Polk County jail on the Alabama warrant, authorities in Florida filed new charges against him for sexual battery after he molested a 10-year-old girl from Polk City. The girl told police Potts had threatened to kill her entire family if she told anybody what he had done. The new charges caught the attention of detectives assigned to Tina’s case, which was now under the review of a cold case unit. Detectives found that Potts had a lengthy criminal record as a repeat sex offender. 

Potts plead not guilty to both of his charges. By Spring 1994, there were pending charges in six states against Frank Potts Jr. By 1995, he was the suspect in the deaths of four people from the Tampa Bay area; two adults and two children, one of which was Tina Janose. 

(*Because Frank Potts Jr.’s criminal record is so lengthy, especially his sex crimes, I won’t get into every specific detail here. This is a summary of his history as a sex offender, and how it pertained to Tina’s murder.*)

In 1981, Frank Potts Jr., then 37, was living with his mother in Lakeland after separating from his wife. He worked on-and-off as a seasonal laborer. He was known in the area for living a “transient lifestyle” and regularly took odd jobs as a migrant fruit picker across the southeastern United States. Potts knew Tina Janose’s family from the fruit business, and Laguan believed he met Tina before in passing, although Potts denied this. 

On October 30, the day before Tina was murdered, Potts’ divorce was finalized. A month later, he was arrested in Lakeland and charged with sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl on Thanksgiving. He was convicted of lewd and lascivious sex acts on a child in May 1982 and was sentenced to 15 years. However, he only served six years of his 15-year sentence, and was released in May 1988. Potts relocated to Alabama, where his crimes continued until his arrest in 1993. 

Ultimately, Potts was convicted for the murder of an Indiana teenager in 1994. He was also convicted of sexual assault on the 10-year-old girl from Lakeland in 1993. He received life without parole and is currently serving his life sentence at Jackson Correctional Institution. He continues to maintain his innocence in both crimes he was convicted of, as well as the multiple allegations against him. He also denies any involvement in Tina’s murder. 

Although both James Norman Ulmer and Frank Potts Jr. both seemed like probable suspects, there was insufficient evidence to charge either of them with the kidnapping and murder of Tina. In 1981, DNA was still an unfamiliar science, and police have not been able to run tests on the evidence obtained from the crime. Tina’s murder remains unsolved after 40 years, but the cold case unit continuously reviews the evidence. In 2002, Laguan Janose told *The Ledger* that the sheriff’s department reaches out to her every year on Halloween, offering their condolences and reminding her that the investigation won’t end until Tina receives justice and her murderer is apprehended.

On June 20, 1982, Ulmer drove to Kathleen, a town 45 minutes north of Wahneta. He parked his 1976 maroon Camaro in a quiet neighborhood and crept across the lawn of a small mobile home. Ulmer removed the screen from the bottom window, climbed inside, and abducted an 11-year-old girl named Lisa.  Ulmer forced Lisa into his Camaro and drove her around the county for hours. When he reached an overpass near I-4, Ulmer pulled over, grabbed Lisa, and drug her out of the car. He then proceeded to push Lisa over the side of the overpass, where she fell 24-feet onto the ground below. Ulmer then fled the scene. 

Incredibly, Lisa survived the fall. She suffered a broken pelvis, fractured wrist, and broken fingers.  The overpass where Lisa was thrown over was north of Lakeland on Old Combee Road, thirteen miles from where Tina was found on I-4. 

Lisa was able to identify James Norman Ulmer as her kidnapper. She remembered several details about his vehicle, including the beads hanging on the rearview mirror, and a large dent on the side. Fingerprints belonging to Ulmer were found on the railing in front of the overpass. Lisa also told police that Ulmer never tried to sexually assault her and never touched her in a sexual manner during the ordeal. 

On November 5, 1982, one year after Tina was murdered, a six-member jury found James Norman Ulmer guilty of kidnapping and attempted murder. A month later, he was sentenced to 80 years in prison. He was also tried and convicted the same year for an unrelated trespassing incident in Wahneta. 

Similarities in Lisa’s attack prompted detectives to question Ulmer about any involvement in Tina Janose’s murder. Following his conviction, detectives tried to interview Ulmer, but he refused to speak to investigators and never commented on any of his crimes. He died in 1996 while receiving treatment for respiratory problems in a prison hospital. 

It would be over a decade before investigators named another person of interest in Tina’s case.

—

In December 1993, a man named Frank Potts Jr. was arrested in Kathleen for an outstanding warrant from Alabama. Frank Potts Jr. was a 50-year-old seasonal citrus laborer from Highland City in Polk County. He was charged with kidnapping a wildlife officer in Alabama in 1992 and was held without bail. 

While Frank Potts Jr. was in the Polk County jail on the Alabama warrant, authorities in Florida filed new charges against him for sexual battery after he molested a 10-year-old girl from Polk City. The girl told police Potts had threatened to kill her entire family if she told anybody what he had done. The new charges caught the attention of detectives assigned to Tina’s case, which was now under the review of a cold case unit. Detectives found that Potts had a lengthy criminal record as a repeat sex offender. 

Potts plead not guilty to both of his charges. By Spring 1994, there were pending charges in six states against Frank Potts Jr. By 1995, he was the suspect in the deaths of four people from the Tampa Bay area; two adults and two children, one of which was Tina Janose. 

(*Because Frank Potts Jr.’s criminal record is so lengthy, especially his sex crimes, I won’t get into every specific detail here. This is a summary of his history as a sex offender, and how it pertained to Tina’s murder.*)

In 1981, Frank Potts Jr., then 37, was living with his mother in Lakeland after separating from his wife. He worked on-and-off as a seasonal laborer. He was known in the area for living a “transient lifestyle” and regularly took odd jobs as a migrant fruit picker across the southeastern United States. Potts knew Tina Janose’s family from the fruit business, and Laguan believed he met Tina before in passing, although Potts denied this. 

On October 30, the day before Tina was murdered, Potts’ divorce was finalized. A month later, he was arrested in Lakeland and charged with sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl on Thanksgiving. He was convicted of lewd and lascivious sex acts on a child in May 1982 and was sentenced to 15 years. However, he only served six years of his 15-year sentence, and was released in May 1988. Potts relocated to Alabama, where his crimes continued until his arrest in 1993. 

Ultimately, Potts was convicted for the murder of an Indiana teenager in 1994. He was also convicted of sexual assault on the 10-year-old girl from Lakeland in 1993. He received life without parole and is currently serving his life sentence at Jackson Correctional Institution. He continues to maintain his innocence in both crimes he was convicted of, as well as the multiple allegations against him. He also denies any involvement in Tina’s murder. 

Although both James Norman Ulmer and Frank Potts Jr. both seemed like probable suspects, there was insufficient evidence to charge either of them with the kidnapping and murder of Tina. In 1981, DNA was still an unfamiliar science, and police have not been able to run tests on the evidence obtained from the crime. Tina’s murder remains unsolved after 40 years, but the cold case unit continuously reviews the evidence. In 2002, Laguan Janose told *The Ledger* that the sheriff’s department reaches out to her every year on Halloween, offering their condolences and reminding her that the investigation won’t end until Tina receives justice and her murderer is apprehended.

People have been speculating that @ mekaylabdy on TikTok may be Mekayla Bali. She shows some similarities, and some were wondering if Mekayla really was posting on TikTok after having gone missing.

Well, I typed in ""Mekayla B"" on Instagram and found the account @ mekaylabdk2 and it's the same girl. She doesn't look like Mekayla at all. She also has a picture with her mother. I think it's safe to say it's not Mekayla Bali, even though I don't think anyone really thought this girl was her anyway. Interesting that she hasn't posted on either account since 2017 though. I wonder if she knows the internet thinks she's a missing girl.

I'm really hoping we get updates on Mekayla's case soon. It's been on my mind so much recently. For some reason I really feel like a new discovery will be made soon. I have no reason to believe this, it's just a feeling really. Fingers crossed.

729,FiveFruitADay,[],1635544657,"I was having a look at the unidentified wiki today and found this case from India, which shocked me.

“Pigs were found gnawing on an unidentified human body near the Nanded-based Dr Shankarrao Chavan Government Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday 20th January 2021

The hospital is located in the Vishnupuri area, on the outskirts of Nanded, around 225 km from here. This incident came to light after some locals spotted a bunch of pigs taking chunks off a body lying in the nullah (a drainage channel) outside the hospital, that remains crowded round the clock with thousands of patients coming from Nanded and surrounding districts.

When contacted, Nanded district collector Vipin Itankar said, “The police are looking into the matter.”
Citing preliminary autopsy report, the Nanded police said the deceased is suspected to be more than 30-years-old and so far, no one has identified or claimed the body. Police have reached out to the residents in the localities around the hospital, apart from contacting security guards deployed at the hospital

A case of accidental death has been registered while a final autopsy report is awaited to ascertain whether the death was accidental, natural or homicidal.

Dr Sudhir Deshmukh, the dean of the hospital, told TOI: “The body was found outside the hospital premises and we suspect that it was lying in the nullah for about 24 hours before being spotted.”
Hospital authorities are also checking if he had been to the hospital as a patient or a patient’s relative in the past two to three days.”


I haven’t seen any update to this case, and I presume the body still remains unidentified, and the fact that their remains have literally been eaten off will probably have destroyed any chance of identifying cause of death. Police suspect it to be accidental. No missing persons case has been found as a match. 

I’m not sure how suspicious the location where his body was found is. From my understanding, nullahs appear to be quite steep and look rather difficult to just fall into. I also don’t think suicide is plausible because from photos they look quite shallow? I’m not from South Asia though, so maybe someone might be able to clarify.

This case really shook me. I know that it’s natural for wild animals to eat human remains if found, but the idea of just going about your day to then find pigs with human body parts in their mouths seems terrifying.

732,shrimp_demon,[],1635525793,"Did anyone see ""The Motive"" on Netflix? Here's a summary: https://thecinemaholic.com/cohen-family-murders-where-is-the-son-now/

I found it slower paced than most crime documentaries. There's not a lot of actual content, beyond the detailed description of the crime. The crime itself is straightfoward enough: 14-yo son shoots his mom and dad with an M-16 at point-blank range as they sleep in bed, then goes upstairs and shoots both sisters (18 and 19 yo). The mystery is WHY. The family name is Cohen, but the kid is unnamed because he committed the crime as a juvenile. The kid and family have no history of interpersonal problems, crime, domestic violence - they were loving by all accounts. The kid claimed an intruder, then some bullshit psychosis that was refuted (a story that evolved to include a little green man telling him to do it) and then later basically recanted...with some weak handwaving claims that the father was controlling and abusive, that not one person could corroborate. One of his sister's close counselors refuted that, and there is zero behavioral or physical evidence to support such a claim in any of the siblings. The perpetrator is obviously a sociopath - he doesn't give a shit that his whole family was dead. He waltzes through the crime scene describing what he did without any hint of emotion. They take him to the cemetery and he doesn't give a fuck. 

In the show, his lawyer implies there must be a rational reason for the murder, that if it were known, would make everything make sense. But that making it known would somehow cause him more harm than to be regarded as a psychopathic freak who just kills. The perp is now 49 years old, has a job and family of his own ... and presumably hasn't committed any additional mass murders. 

Watching his lack of normal emotions, I think he really is just a freak. He killed them because he could. And he basically got away with it...a relative slap on the wrist, received the whole family inheritance, and went on to have a ""normal"" life as a functional psychopath. 

Why do you think he did it? Do you think the lawyer even actually knows anything?","""The Motive""? remains unknown. 14-yo boy shot his whole family in Jerusalem, 1986"
733,ZGBryant7,[],1635500683,"I have a theory that the attack on Paul Stein was possibly because of his Jewish heritage/religion and that the Zodiac Killer may have been anti-Jewish/anti-Semitic in this period of time or obtained anti-Semitic views. One reason I have to believe this is that there is a synagogue towards the left side of the Presidio Heights. I believe the Zodiac Killer may somehow got knowledge that the cab driver Paul Stine visited this synagogue or the fact that he was just Jewish in general and then selected him as a target based on this. He was ""looking for a Jew to kill"" in other words, though that sounds rather harsh. I think it is a common stereotype that cab driver are Jewish, not too be racist sounding like that every cab driver has to be a Jew but I feel like this is a stereotype. He thought he was killing a Jew by killing a cab driver is possibly what i'm trying to say because cab driver's are Jews in his mind especially with the last name Stine. Reasons why this might be true is that the Zodiac Killer said ""I am not afraid of the gas chamber"" in one of his correspondences. I think this was said as a pun that he was not afraid of the gas chamber and found it horrific like the Jews in World War II/thought he would be a hypocrite if he had a Nazi like ideology while being afraid of the weapon used to kill a race/ethnicity he thought to be inferior. Plug in the words ""unlike the Jews"" after gas chamber and that makes things make more sense puts things in context better. I think it is possible the Zodiac Killer adopted anti-senitic views after possibly reading a book/work like ""Mein Kampf"" in his latter adolescent years. It not certain that the Zodiac Killer implicitly hated Jews as people but I think he was at his most vicious at the time of the Stine attack as he had committed 4 murders within the following year and was acting on all his impulses. Zodiac in his prime if you will and playing into the Zodiac persona wanting to make his murders as interesting as possible and he spiced up the mystique by gaining possession on a piece of the cab driver's shirt showing he had the upper hand on police and showing people that he could strike anywhere at any time and there was little anybody could do to stop him as they not know where or when he would strike next. Like a ticking time bomb. Killing a Jewish person also fit's in with the idea that the Zodiac Killer saw himself as the reincarnation of a Pharaoh/Pharaoh. Jews were sent into exile/persecuted by the Pharaoh's in the Exodus section of the bible. Zodiac clearly saw himself as Pharaoh like or some sort of Prophet you can see this in his correspondences like the Halloween card in which he uses the eye of Osiris/Horus and uses the LF symbol with 4 dots that is the Great Pyramid(you can tell this is the great Pyramid because of the line that goes up and to the left. It is the ventilation chamber out of the Pyramid. I have seen this symbol explained as other things. It is obviously the Great Pyramid and eyes of the Sphinx to me and I believe that is the killer's intent). Both of these symbols are Egyptian in nature enhancing/making sense with the idea of the Zodiac Killer seeing himself as a Pharaoh/Messianic figure. Z is interestingly representative of the number 7 in Hieratic Egyptian numbers. 7 was the most important number to the Zodiac as well as the number's 13 and 9. 7 was the most important number to the ancient Egyptians as it was the number of planets they could see (pertains to Zodiac) and square root of their number for the universe 49 which also adds to get 13 (4+9) by using numerology, the second most important number to the Zodiac besides 7 and the number of letters in his real name (Z13). Basically I think Paul Stine may have been implicitly targeted based on his Jewry and this makes sense with the Zodiac Killer seeing himself as a living Pharaoh/Pharaohnic which can be reinforced by the appearance of Egyptian symbols in the Zodiac Killer's letters (specifically the Halloween card).

734,rustcole01,[],1635480557,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder\_Mountain\_(TV\_series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Mountain_(TV_series)) [Murder Mountain (TV Series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Mountain_(TV_series)) 

So I just rewatched the entire MM doc after recently watching a Hulu doc called Sasquatch. Don't worry, it's not actually about Sasquatch. But the dude (David) who made the Sasquatch doc, had coincidentally worked on a grow farm, on Murder Mountain, in the early 90's.

Dude was in his early 20's and was working up on Spy Rock on the mountain. During his stay, there was a chaotic night where a couple of the runners for this farm, showed back up and were spinning out. Apparently while they were out on a deal they rolled up on a pile of body parts that came from 3 different bodies. The guys were freaking out and telling the property owner about what they saw and that included gigantic human-like footprints in the mud that was surrounding the mutilated corpses. The guys swore that it was an animal attack, and not just that... but a Sasquatch.

This guy David didn't stay long on the farm and eventually became a pretty well-known investigative journalist. After seeing some recent stories about Humboldt county, it triggered his memory of what happened when he was up there and he decided to investigate. Long story made incredibly short, there were different gangs trying to infiltrate Murder Mountain, including Mexican cartels. The property owners in the area got together and arranged to stage a brutal murder scene (or scenes) that was meant to look like a Sasquatch/Werewolf attack, with the idea that the more superstitious cartel operatives would get spooked and avoid the area.

The way they planned for this to work was to set up chatter-boxes and inside men. One of the 2 witnesses to that brutal pile of body parts was in on the scam and helped the other guy come to the conclusion that they were looking at a vicious animal attack that pointed toward a possible BigFoot/Werewold/Chupacabra. The petrified witness was an unwitting accomplice (And the chatterbox) in this whole scam and is ultimately what the plan hinged on. And it worked. Word spread throughout the area that a giant BigFoot or animal was shredding people up on the mountain and everyone except the farm owners came to believe the stories. They also just disappeared some random migrant workers from Mexico every now and then, to keep the legend alive.

I think the same strategy was employed in regards to people involved in the Murder Mountain doc. I also think that 1 or 2 guys from the Alderpoint 8, helped engineer the vigilante narrative in order for it to look like the discovery of Garrett Rodriguez's body was made in good faith. From what I've been able to gather, Garrett's parents brought a ton of attention to the mountain.... between the hiring of the PI's, which led to the discovery of Garrett's truck, as well as the documentary filmmakers of MM snooping around and investigating. 

When the top dogs of the mountain realized how much scrutiny might fall on them, they decided to cook up a story to explain Garrett's death and give people a bad guy to blame for his murder. IMO, there is more going on up there than just illegal grow ops but save that for another day. Either way, I think the top dogs decided to force out the ""Alleged murderer"" by beating him and shooting him and threatening to kill him if he ever showed up again. And the entire A8 group also agreed to stick to the same story. They would claim that they caught wind of what happened to Garrett, confronted the man responsible, forced out a confession and then led the cops to the body.

I have no idea what actually happened but the telling of the stories by the people in the doc was suspect, at best. I think that older woman in the doc, who claimed to be conducting an amateur investigation with her friend was the unwitting chatterbox in this scenario. I think someone was feeding her the information that they wanted her to repeat all over town and it helped corroborate the story that they had crafted.

And based on the fallout, it almost seems like someone cleaned house for whatever reason. At first, Neil Decker was supposedly the only one dishing out the beating to Garrett's killer. Then later in the doc, after Neill had been murdered at Scott Johnson's house by Matt Brown, the story changed a little. Then apparently, Bob Holtsclaw was the one who pistol whipped the ""alleged"" and shot him in the ear, while aiding in the extraction of a confession. 

That's kinda strange but then Scott Johnson, who was one of the top dogs in the area and also, the guy who brought Matt Brown onto the mountain, decided he was gonna to a location that Matt Brown was supposedly holed up in. Apparently, someone called Scott and told him where Matt was staying. Scott then prepares to go on this mission with another local by the name of ""Redhead Dave"" and some other unnamed dude that no one in Scott's family seemed to know. Scott's wife claims that they left the house on foot and walked to the cabin where Matt was supposed to be. Then the 3 men split up, checked out the cabin and couldn't find Matt Brown inside. 

This is where the story gets absurd. After the guys are unable to locate Matt Brown, they fall back. As Scott Johnson exits the woods outside the cabin property, he is ""accidentally"" gunned down by the unnamed man in the group. ""Redhead Dave"" claims to have not seen the incident but did say he heard the gun shots. He also says that after the unnamed man realized he killed Scott, he loaded him in the back of his pickup truck and took off. At which point, Scott's body allegedly fell out of the bed of the truck, onto the middle of the dirt road and they just left him there in a panic. 

So much Tom-fuckery to unpack here but number 1 is.... the wife said they left on foot, yet now, this unnamed ""friend"" and accidental killer, has his truck parked near the cabin. And then they just leave their dead friend in the middle of nowhere at night, even though they were in a remote location with no cops around. Seems odd. But the most ridiculous part of all this is, Matt Brown was arrested at the cabin the next morning. Brown claims that as he was escorted off the property in cuffs, he saw Scott's dead body. Matt maintains that he never had a problem with Scott and that he doesn't believe that Scott would have gone on an extraction mission with the 2 men that he went with. Again, I have no idea what happened but I think Scott was set up and dumped near Matt's cabin in order to complicate the investigation. Matt claimed that he never heard any gun shots and said he had no idea that the men were ever on his property. In a police interview, he also claimed that there were motion sensors and flood lights that would have been set off if people did come snooping around the house.

And last but not least.... Bob Holtsclaw. The last surviving member out of the 3 men who supposedly elicited the confession from Garrett's killer. Bob was murdered in broad daylight by Zach Harris, not long after Scott Johnson was killed. 

The only remaining survivor from the group of men that supposedly heard the alleged murderer confess to killing Garrett is John Reilly Sr (The Vietnam vet dude who returned the fishing poles to Garrett's dad at the end of the doc). Wasn't quite sure what to make of this dude, but then in the final episode, we learn that John Sr had a son, John Reilly Jr, who is the original witness, who spotted the alleged murderer with Garrett's truck and apparently, he was also present for the confession. Junior claims that he asked where Garrett was one day and the alleged claimed that he was down in Mexico, fishing and surfing. But Junior then claimed to see the fishing poles and surfboard in the bed of the truck and when he confronted the alleged about this fact, he was given a death stare and told to fuck off. This is supposed to be the catalyst that led to Junior telling people that he believed he knew this guy had murdered and disappeared Garrett and this is what caused the Alderpoint 8 to kidnap the alleged murderer and force him to reveal the location of Garrett's body.

I'm not sure how all the pieces connect here but I am almost positive that there are elements of this story that were a complete setup. I realize this turned into a tldr, but if anyone has anything to add, I'd be interested to hear it. All I know is, I am not buying the narrative from the Netflix doc.",Murder Mountain Theory... Some parts of this seem like a setup.
735,bengoshijane,[],1635468342,"There are multiple incidents of robberies being accomplished by the use of a “knockout gas” or “sleeping gas.” However, many experts state that knocking people out with such a gas is very unlikely. Experts claim would be incredibly difficult to amass a large quantity of gas, and impracticable to administer it. They are also usually unable to identify what gas could be being used. As such, the reports of “knockout gas” robberies is largely written off as an urban myth.

Here is a collection of reports from Europe that I could locate about potential “knockout gas” robberies going back more than 20 years.  There are some commonalities in the reports. For example, all of the victims were asleep when robbed. Most were wealthy and on vacation. Most victims reported feeling out of sorts in the morning. Rarely did anyone awaken during the robbery despite the perpetrators often breaking in and ransacking the place. Still, there is much skepticism that any kind of knockout gas could be used for such attacks.

Former Arsenal footballer Patrick Vieira said he and his family (wife and two kids) were knocked out by gas during robbery of their home in Cannes. Jewelry and cash was stolen. The robbers also stoke Mr. Vieira’s Mercedes and used it as a getaway car.  The Vieira family reported feeling unwell when they awoke and called police. Five men were eventually arrested for this crime, although the type of gas used was not identified. Reports say the gas was likely pumped into the house through the home’s air conditioning system, although there is no account of a confession by the perpetrators.

The eight year old boy had needle marks on his arm. Police suggest that Russian or Romanian gangs may be responsible.

August 30, 2011 - Porto Cervo, Sardinia, Italy

There were two homes targeted in August of 2011 in the wealthy retreat of Porto Cervo on Sardinia's Costa Smeralda. Police believe thieves who made off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and jewels used sleeping gas on their victims to ensure they were not disturbed during the break-in. Robbers broke into a holiday villa rented by a Milanese pharmaceuticals tycoon and left with a haul worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. The businessman's wife, her mother and their daughter were all in the house, along with a servant, but no one heard anything even though the windows were removed from their hinges to permit the robbers entry. At the villa next door, two other guests discovered a watch and cash missing. They reported waking up feeling weak and dazed.

The report from Proto Cervo notes that in the prior month of July, ""gassing gangs"" were reported to be targeting motorhomes (called “caravans” or “camper vans” in Europe) by spraying some kind of “sleeping gas” in through air vents before breaking in. The report also notes that “similar robberies have been reported this summer in France and Spain.”

November 2011 - Malaga, Costa Del Sol, Spain

At least six homes were broken into in the early hours of the morning. Robbers stole any cash they could find. Residents awoke with headaches nausea and dizziness. Their wallets and handbags were strewn around the yard with all the cash missing. The evening was hot and many residents had left windows open. All of the apartments that were robbed were on the first floor. A resident named José Luis Gómez was quoted as saying the victims had woken “dizzy, with headaches, vomiting and stinging throats.”

August 2015 - Saint Tropez, France 

Anaesthetic gas may have been used in a robbery involving former Formula 1 driver Jenson Button.  Mr. Button, his wife and about a dozen friends were all vacationing in Saint Tropez in rented villas. According to Mr. Button’s spokesman, two intruders stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other valuable from the villa, including Mrs. Button's engagement ring.  The victims believe some kind of anaesthetic gas was used to incapacitate them although medical experts stated that a knockout agent was highly unlikely and it would have required a massive amount of gas to accomplish such a thing.

August 12, 2014 - Motorhome Robbery in France

A British family have said they were robbed by thieves who likely pumped noxious exhaust fumes into their motorhome as they slept in a rest area by the side of a motorway in France. Thieves may have attached a tube to a vehicle exhaust pipe and pumped the fumes into the motorhome, resulting in the occupants falling unconsciousness. Robbers then broke into the vehicle after they were confident the occupants were knocked out and took cash and belongings. The family woke up with terrible headaches and sore throats. French police were called out and sent the family to hospital where they were informed they had been poisoned by carbon monoxide.

September 2018 - Saint Tropez, France

Former Top Gear and current The Grand Tour host Richard Hammond, his family and friends were robbed while vacationing in Saint Tropez. The Hammonds were staying in a rented villa with twelve (12) other people. At one point, Mrs. Mindy Hammond actually heard noises and went downstairs to see what was going on when she heard a door shut. She heard a male voice on the other side of the door and presumed was one of the guests staying up late. She went back to bed. In retrospect, she believes it was the robbers preparing for the heist. The next morning, all fifteen (15) guests awoke to open bedroom doors and missing cash and jewelry. The Hammonds believe the villa was filled with anesthetic gas while everyone slept although experts were again skeptical of such a scenario.

August 2019 - Motorhome Attack in France

A family of two adults and three children were driving back to the UK in their motorhome after vacationing in France and Spain when they stopped at a service station in Antran, near Poitiers, to sleep for the night. Robbers pumped some kind of sleeping gas into the van through the air vents and then broken in through the door taking passports, wallets, handbags, medications and other valuables. The family work up groggy. There was CCTV footage from the service station showing figures jumping a fence and heading towards the motorhome. The victims report that police told them they'd seen this kind of thing numerous times.

&amp;#x200B;

EXPERTS ARE SKEPTICAL OF GAS ATTACKS

Despite all these reports, there is much doubt about the existence of a ""sleeping gas.""  Many medical experts doubt anaesthetic gases could be used to accomplish burglaries. In the UK, the Royal College of Anaesthetists released a statement saying it was highly skeptical about robbers using anaesthetic gas. ""It is the view of the College that it would not be possible to render someone unconscious by blowing ether chloroform, or any of the currently used volatile anaesthetic agents, through the window of a motorhome without their knowledge, even if they were sleeping at the time,” the statement said.

A Royal College of Anaesthetics spokesperson told the BBC that gassing an entire villa was even less likely than a motorhome: “They would need massive amounts of gas. We can’t rule out that some sort of agent was used, but the volume of gas and the logistics involved in delivering it make it highly unlikely that this was anaesthetic.” They added: “When you combine that with the fact that these gases are expensive and difficult to get hold of, we are very skeptical.”

2009 Ghost Rapes of Bolivia

The Manitoba Colony in Bolivia is an insular, conservative, Mennonite community that rejects modern technology. There are no webcams, internet or house alarms in the community. Women in the community were waking up feeling violated, often with blood and semen on themselves or their sheets. Some went to sleep in their clothes, only to wake up naked, in pain and with dirty fingerprints on them. Another woman had a dream of being raped in a field and then woke up with dirt and grass in her hair. Another woman reported waking up in her bed with small pieces of rope tied to her wrist and ankles. The women reported waking up lethargic and with a pounding headache. There are many stories, some involving children. Families were locking doors, trying to stay awake and having people stand guard, but nothing seemed to work and the rapes continued for years. 

In June of 2009, two men were caught breaking into a home. The two disclosed there was a group of nine (9) Manitoba men who perpetrated the rapes. The accused eventually confessed that they had been raping women in the community since 2005.  To incapacitate victims and potential witnesses, the perpetrators used a spray created by a veterarian for anesthetizing cows. The drug was reportedly derived from the belladonna plant. The perpetrators stated they would spray the substance through screens to drug entire families. Officially there were 130 victim, but authorities believe the true number of victims is much higher. Even more disturbing, there are reports that the kind of rapes continue to happen.

October 2002 – Moscow Theater Hostage Crisis

The 2002 Moscow Theater Hostage Crisis proves that gas can be used to knockout large groups of people in a large building.  For anyone unfamiliar with this disaster, here is a short summary of those events:

On the evening of October 23, 2002, during an sold-out performance of Nord-Ost, the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow was seized by armed gang of about 40 to 60 Chechen rebels. A mass hostage situation ensued wherein approximately 850 to 900 hostages, including audience members and actors. Hostages were held inside the theater. On the fourth day of the crisis (October 26, 2002) at about 5:00 a.m., some unknown aerosol gas was pumped into the building. It was released either through a hole in the wall, or into the building's ventilation system, or underneath the stage. Thirty minutes later, hostages began falling asleep. But some of the hostage-takers had gas masks, but they were killed in a firefight when Russian special forces stormed the building.

As bodies were taken out of the building, they were lined up in rows at the main entrance. Their faces had a white, waxy, drawn appearance indicative of poisoning by some kind of anesthetic gas. Emergency responders were anticipating treating gunshots and did not have the means to treat a gas attack. All of the insurgents and about 130 hostages died. Some of the insurgents died from the gas. Those that had a gasmask were shot. Almost all of the hostages were killed by the gas. The Russian government has refused to release highly-relevant information, such as the type of gas used. Information that has been released is not reliable. For example, Russia claimed no children died when, in fact, between five and fifteen children died. Hospital personnel were not even advised what kind of gas was used or how to treat patients, likely resulting in even more deaths. 

Again, the type of gas used is unknown. Russia will not give an answer because disclosure would likely intimate a violation of anti-chemical weapon treaties. In any event, foreigners who made it out had their clothes tested when they returned home to the UK.  Results of testing point towards the gas used is suspected to have been some kind of fentanyl or fentanyl-derviative.  Later analysis showed that the veterinary large animal drug carefentanil and anesthetic agent reminfentanil were likely suspended in an anesthetic agent halothane.

A Note About “Devils’ Breath”

It is also worth noting that there is a drug from South America (Equador and Columbia) called scopolamine, or dragon's breath, that may incapacitate victims. It was featured in a Vice News documentary.  Scopolamine is considered to be one of the original ""truth serum"" drugs and is derived from the nightshade plant.  The drug's effect are to cause a loss of free will, followed by complete incapacitation. There are numerous reports of criminals blowing scopolamine powder into the faces of victims and then persuading the victims to hand over their belongings, or otherwise giving criminals access to their property, although these reports have also been chalked up to being an urban myth.

&amp;#x200B;

CONCLUSION

Are all of these tourists wrong? Or is there something to the suggestion of knockout gas being piped into homes and motorhomes? If the reports are to be believed, what kind of gas is being used and where is it coming from?  If it is some kind of narcotic or anesthetic gas, has anyone died or is it just a matter of time until that happens?

Personally, I suspect these attacks are likely real.  Perhaps the motorhome victims were attacked with carbon monoxide from the exhaust of the robber’s vehicle? It seems one case confirmed that was the gas used. But such a scenario seems unlikely to be effective for homes and villas.","Are People Vacationing in Europe Being Robbed after Being Rendered Unconscious with Some Kind of Sleeping Gas?

GRAND ISLE, La. — After nearly 40 years, an infamous cold case in Sabine Parish has been solved. The bones found at the bottom of a well near Many, La. have been identified as those of a Grand Isle man who had been missing since 1984. 

Authorities positively identified the body of 58-year-old Lester Rome Monday, the Sabine Parish Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.

Rome was reported missing from Grand Isle in 1984. 

Two years later came the ""Man in the Well"" case. 

In April 1986, a landowner in Sabine Parish found skeletal remains in a well on his property. Some of the bones were recovered, but not enough to make a positive ID. 

The case went cold for decades until 2013 when LSU's Forensic Anthropology and Computer Enhancement Services Laboratory made a possible connection between the Man in the Well case and Rome's disappearance. 

The skeletal remains that were recovered from the well had shotgun pellets embedded in the pelvic area. That matched information about Rome, who had been shot in the abdomen with a shotgun years before he went missing. 

But despite the promising lead, no more progress was made until 2021. In February, the current owner of the land where the well sits gave permission to detectives to conduct another search. 

While their first February attempt to recover more bones with a mechanical grabber were unsuccessful, a second attempt in April using the Central Sabine Fire Department's confined space entry team had more luck. 

That team recovered more bones and some other evidence from the bottom of the well.

Monday, the cases were confirmed to be one and the same: the man in the well was in fact, Lester Rome. 

His next of kin was notified by the parish coroner's office, but Sabine Parish detectives are still investigating the case to determine who may have been responsible for Rome's death. 

Shreveport-area TV station KTBS reports that the items pulled from the well with Rome's bones were what allowed the coroner's office to positively ID him. 

Sabine Parish Detective Chris Abrahams told the station that he couldn't tell them what had been pulled from the well because he was confident they were evidence that could lead to an arrest soon.","Sabine Parish, Louisiana ""Man in the Well"" identified as Lester Rome"
738,Bisbenzimide,[],1635440690,"So sometimes I go down rabbit holes. Whether it's creeping, Dr. Google-ing yourself, etc. I was raised Catholic but my long-term boyfriend is Hindu. We're both trying to find out more history on our religions since our parents know much more. Honestly, we're both scientists, so neither of us really care so much about religion (i.e. we don't really practice or 100% belive in anything, we question a lot as scientists), but we find the stories fascinating. Today he was telling me about Diwali and its origins, so I tried telling him about the origins of Santa Claus and how they started with St. Nicholas. We've watched the movie ""Klaus"" so he had some idea already, but I realized when trying to go back further in the origins truly didn't know. Flash forward to 3 hours of rabbit-holing later...I find out that Santa Claus is based on the saint, Saint Nicholas (this I already knew)...St. Nicholas was a bishop originally from England (Greece at the time, but I'm also unclear if he moved to Germany)...He didn't really give toys to kids, more so money left from his wealthy parents, and used money for good deeds (later English [British] women started the tradition of putting treats and nuts and toys in socks to honor his tradition of gift giving)...Arsenic also has something to do with him, I think possibly how he was killed estimated to be in 345 A.D. from imprisonment and subsequent death at the hands of the Roman Emperor, Diocletian...and his body's remnants produce a relic called ""manna""...and this manna is thought to be a holy curing water but scientists really think it could simply be condensation since his tomb sits below sea level...BUT either way this manna is collected annually during St. Nicholas's celebration...AND YOU CAN LITERALLY BUY THIS LIQUID MANNA ONLINE! So when people ask me what I want for Christmas this year, I honestly really want to say (whether it's fake or not I don't care) ""bone ooze from Santa Claus"". I can literally buy it on eBay right now for $16, or Amazon for $22.

Pelkey was murdered in 1983 by Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen.

In 1984, Pelkey's body was recovered outside Anchorage near Horseshoe Lake. She was one of over a dozen of Hansen's female victims whose bodies had been scattered throughout Anchorage's surrounding wilderness. She had no identification but an autopsy determined she was a white female between the ages of 17-23. Authorities could not match her to any missing persons so she was given the Horseshoe Harriet name and buried in the municipal cemetery in an unmarked grave. 



Robin Pelkey was born in Colorado but she grew up in Arkansas. In 1981, she moved to Anchorage to live with her father and stepmother. However, she ended living on the streets of Anchorage and working as a sex worker to support herself. According to family, she vanished sometime between late 1982 to 1983. Neither of her parents or any other family member or friend ever reported her missing. Hansen told authorities he abducted Pelkey in 1983 and transported her in his small plane to the Horseshoe Lake area where he killed her and disposed of body. Although he admitted to murdering over 15 women, only 12 bodies were recovered and he was tried and convicted for four of the killings. Reportedly, Hansen confessed that he targeted women living on the margins because he knew they were unlikely to be missed.

Pelkey's case was reopened in 2014 after Hansen died in prison. Her body was exhumed and samples were used to construct a DNA sample that was loaded into the FBIs missing persons database. No matches were found. In 2020, investigators turned to genetic genealogy in hopes of identifying her. Additional samples were sent to a lab for Whole Genome Sequencing to be completed then entered into a genealogy website open to the public. Eventually, a close family match was made in Arkansas that lead to additional tests that revealed Robin Pelkey was the victim murdered 37 years ago. Family members were happy she had her name back but did not wish to speak the media.

**Background**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Carmelo García Ramos** was 33-years old in 2005. He was born in the island of [Gran Canaria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gran+Canaria/@27.9393052,-15.5525303,84855m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xc40855504bf07c1:0x2ec916c8a5acdb16!8m2!3d27.9202202!4d-15.5474373), and had lived there all his life, just like his family. they lived at the small town of [La Aldea](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Aldea+de+San+Nicolas+de+Tolentino,+Las+Palmas,+Espa%C3%B1a/@27.9820918,-15.7790191,1325m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xc40855504bf07c1:0x2ec916c8a5acdb16!2sGran+Canaria!3b1!8m2!3d27.9202202!4d-15.5474373!3m4!1s0xc40882adc4ee16b:0x79c9842f9be94c7a!8m2!3d27.9822036!4d-15.7793498), in the western flank of the island. With a population of just 7,608 inhabitants (2018) La Aldea relies on both agriculture and fishing for its economy, and it's surrounded by very big and rugged cliffs and mountains. In fact, before modern roads and tunnels connected the town with other parts of the island in the 1980's the access to La Aldea was very difficult. So much so that back then it could take a person in [Las Palmas](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Las+Palmas+de+Gran+Canaria,+Las+Palmas,+Espa%C3%B1a/@28.098722,-15.4571299,21182m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xc4094518b44a92f:0x40340f3be4d13e0!8m2!3d28.1008837!4d-15.4653897) (the island's capital city) several hours to reach La Aldea by car, even though the straight line between both points is just 38 kilometers (24 miles) long. Nowadays that same drive can be done in about one hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Carmelo's life wasn't at all easy. He had been a heroin addict for many years, just like his friends. In 2005 he was living with his parents at La Aldea. He was trying to quit heroin and sort his life out, but he was struggling with his addiction and he had relapsed many times.

&amp;#x200B;

[Carmelo](https://www.qsdglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/09_04_05-CARMELO-GARCIA-RAMOS.jpg) is described as of slim complexion, with tanned skin, curly black hair and brown eyes. He's 180 cm tall (or 5ft11) and has a noticeable scar on his right eyebrow.

He and two of his long time friends (who also had a history of heroin addiction) would hike all the way to [Punta Arenas beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Playa+de+Las+Arenas+(Punta+G%C3%B3ngora)/@28.0418977,-15.7644708,1325m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xc40855504bf07c1:0x2ec916c8a5acdb16!2sGran+Canaria!3b1!8m2!3d27.9202202!4d-15.5474373!3m4!1s0xc408bf870a6f3a1:0xbfae6b7de87af0e!8m2!3d28.0431451!4d-15.7658217) and camp there. They planned to swim in the ocean, but also intended to use the camping trip to do some fishing and especially to gather some seafood (a very popular activity among the locals there). According to his parents, Carmelo took with him his backpack, which he always carried with him every time he went to the beach or to camp somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Punta Arenas beach is a very secluded sedimentary beach on top of a strip of lava from an ancient volcanic eruption that became petrified when it made contact with the sea. [It's surrounded by very high cliffs](https://static.diariosur.es/comun/movil2016/imagenes_playas/0002548.jpg) and it's only accessible either by sea or by a very narrow and twisty hiking path. The drive by road from La Aldea to the [beginning of the hiking path](https://www.google.com/maps/@28.0357051,-15.7582444,3a,75y,86.55h,86.91t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPaGFt1PAiN1z919K3r0i7x-4PVAm25MGkFqjEX!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPaGFt1PAiN1z919K3r0i7x-4PVAm25MGkFqjEX%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya98.823555-ro-0-fo100!7i9728!8i3906) is relatively quick; it takes only about 20 minutes. However, the hiking trail itself is way more nuanced. Even though the straight line from the road to the beach is just 1.25 kilometers long (0.7 miles) the trail itself extends over six kilometers (or four miles) because there's a difference in altitude of 550 meters (or 1800 feet).

&amp;#x200B;

In short, it's a rather difficult, narrow and twisty hike from the road to the beach. Locals say that it often takes a couple of hours to complete, and they also advise against wandering into it if one happens to be scared of heights. [Here's a video of the trail for a better depiction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gugk6DRFWpk) Because of this, the beach is very secluded from civilization. Often times it's hard to get phone signal in that area.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

&amp;#x200B;

**April 9th, 2005. The return from the beach**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Carmelo's friends were back in La Aldea by Saturday of that week. However, Carmelo was not. His absence wasn't noticed until later that month, when his parents had tried to call him, in vain (they thought the three friends had decided to extend their time at the beach). Things became more strange when they contacted the two friends; both said that Carmelo ""did just disappear"". When his parents pressed them to elaborate further they explained that at some point of the camping trip Carmelo announced that he was ""going to see if he could gather some seafood"", after which they saw him heading towards a small rocky cove nearby. After that, according to them, they never saw Carmelo again.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course his friends' attitude raised alarms in the minds of Carmelo's parents. Why didn't they contact authorities? They were his long time friends. Why didn't they even contact Carmelo's family? And why were they so evasive? 

&amp;#x200B;

Carmelo's parents walked into [the local police office](https://www.google.com/maps/@27.9849899,-15.7805667,3a,15y,351.98h,92.8t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipP-SD0J63d_21ggGUCE4Cpau2N2CzdSROqecvzf!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipP-SD0J63d_21ggGUCE4Cpau2N2CzdSROqecvzf%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya241.75336-ro0-fo100!7i13312!8i6656) that same day (there isn't a police station there, let's remember it's just a 7,000-people town) and filed a missing person report.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Search and investigation**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Suspecting that Carmelo could be found either in the sea or in the surrounding cliffs and coves, the local police chief Raimundo Morales immediately contacted the SAR team, which coordinated a search operation with boats and helicopters. Even a team of scuba divers looked for Carmelo, or at the very least clues, in the sea floor surrounding the area. Another team searched the hiking trail and other ones nearby with trained dogs. All search efforts came back empty handed; there wasn't any clue of Carmelo's whereabouts, much less any clue of what happened to him. Not even in the very spot where the three men had camped.

&amp;#x200B;

But it wasn't until a few days later when a strange potential clue showed up; Carmelo's backpack (the one his parents said he took with him when he left) was found on the rooftop of his parents' house. However, his copy of the house keys and his wallet appeared on a cave at the beach the trio camped in.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Aftermath**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To this day there's no conclusive lead that could explain what happened to Carmelo at some point of these four days in the beach. Carmelo's friends were questioned by the police, but they have never faced any charges, even though they failed to report Carmelo's disappearance.

&amp;#x200B;

[Carmelo's family](https://static1.canarias7.es/www/multimedia/201704/10/media/cortadas/461347-1g_CSN461347_MG2222106--624x351.jpg) still believes nowadays he was murdered at the beach by his friends. They even question that the trio ever reached the beach to begin with. Carmelo's sister Rosa received an anonymous phone call in which an unknown male voice informed her that Carmelo had been murdered by his friends.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the two friends that went with Carmelo to the beach died in 2013, when a landslide killed him near the very beach where Carmelo reportedly went missing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The case has been inactive since 2008 due to lack of new evidence. The most accepted hypothesis for the authorities is that Carmelo suffered a fatal accident (either drowned or fell to his death) and that his remains have not been found yet.

*""They took my brother's life""*

*CARLOS SANTANA BELTRÁN Monday, April 10, 2017, 01:00*

*This Sunday it was 12 years since Carmelo García Ramos disappeared on the beach of Las Arenas in the Aldea de San Nicolás, when he was spending a few days with two friends, one of them died in 2013. His sister is convinced that it was murdered. Rosa Elena García Ramos has not stopped a single day in the last twelve years wondering where she is and what happened to her brother Carmelo García Ramos, who has disappeared since April 9, 2005 when he was spending a few days on the beach in Las Arenas, between the municipalities of La Aldea de San Nicolás and Artenara. Since then, there are many unknowns that remain unclear. «It is very hard, especially when I have had to search for it practically on my own. Not be forgotten. Twelve years ago my brother disappeared. I am convinced that they took his life, ""says the sister of the disappeared firmly from the family home in La Aldea de San Nicolás. He never believed the version that the two friends with whom Carmelo went to spend a few days at the aforementioned beach, one of them tragically died in 2013 when a cave collapsed on the same beach. “They said that he was shellfish on the coast, catching limpets and that they did not see him again. I never believed that story. If it was true and he drowned, why didn't they notify the emergency services? Why didn't they tell him at the time to look for him? ”She wonders. She herself went to the beach to search for some clue or something that would clarify what happened after hearing that first story. ""I made it all the way to the beach and tracked it down all the way. In the cave where they used to spend the night I found his wallet and the keys to my parents' house. He would never have gone up without the keys and the wallet. He was very responsible. That's why I think they killed him, that something bad had to happen to him because he hadn't left just like that, without warning and leaving my parents alone, ”she reaffirms.*  


 

#","In 2005 Carmelo García went with two friends to camp on a remote beach in the island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). Four days later his friends returned from the beach without Carmelo; according to them ""he just disappeared"". No trace of him has been found ever since."

The homicide itself remains unsolved. Colorado Bureau of Investigation was asked by the Sheridan Police Department to take another look at the case in 2020. After taking a look, it was found that several items were preserved well enough to be new testing for fingerprints and DNA. This led authorities to discover the victim was of middle eastern decent when it was previously believed he was a mexican national. Authorities were able to locate the victim's family in Israel.

742,Magoatt,[],1635349637,"
Today is the 15th anniversary of the unsolved deaths of Sacramento Sheriff deputy Jeffery Mitchel and the discovery the bodies of Allan Shubert, and Nicole Welch. 

What Happened:

Deputy Jeffery Mitchell a 9 year old veteran on the force was patrolling in early hours of October 27th. In the early hours of October 27th 2006 at 3:30 AM Mitchell contacted the Sacramento County Police department from his in vehicle computer. Mitchell reported he was pulling over a white Chevrolet van with one occupant for no back license plate. After a few minutes passed from the initial report when the dispatch tried to contact Mitchell. He failed to respond to which sent alarms bells ringing to the dispatcher. Police officers were dispatched to his location to see if Mitchell required assistance. 

Upon finding where Mitchell’s vehicle was they came upon a violent scene. Deputy Mitchell was behind his car having been shot in the head with his own service weapon. At the crime scene a partial DNA profile along with fingers prints were pulled from the gun but not enough to identify the suspect. Despite Mitchell being airlifted to the hospital he passed away due to his injuries an hour later. 

Search for the Vehicle:

The police began the search for the white van and they would actually would find it the next day. A couple had called the police after they found the suspected vehicle dumped in the Consumnes River by Highway 49. The location of the vehicle was located in the river which was just a mere 27 minutes from where Mitchell was killed. Inside of the vehicle police made a startling discovery two bodies with one being the registered owner of the van Allan Shubert and other Nicole Welch whose was a friend of Allan. Both of the two had been last seen alive at 9:00 PM on October 26th 2006. 

The most chilling detail was that both had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning. Authorities believe they had been dead before Mitchell was shot during the traffic stop on October 27th. Later down the line the two would be ruled out as suspects by authorities and their case has as well gone cold. Police suspect that when Mitchell pulled over the killer was on the way to dump the bodies of the two victims in the back of the van later found. Since the aftermath of this police have interviewed several suspects and they have confirmed that they have two people of interest who have not been ruled out but the one thing keeping them from making the arrest is lack of evidence. 

If you have any information related to the case you can call the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office cold case homicide unit’s phone number 916-874-5057.

743,beerinsodacups,[],1635348803,"[Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.com/missing-united-airlines-executive-found-135500536.html) reported this morning that the body of a United Airlines executive, Jacob Cefolia, who has been missing for more than a year was found in a forest preserve near Chicago.

“DuPage County Coroner Richard Jorgensen said in a statement that he heard reports of a deceased person found in the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve on Friday. Contractors in the preserve found the body hanging by a belt from an uprooted tree in an area that local police had repeatedly searched. The coroner's office was able to affirm the body's identity by the end of the day.”

[Another outlet says](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/missing-united-airlines-executive-body-darien-b1944552.html) that his “wallet, driver’s license and other personal belongings were also found at the location, police said. The clothes matched with what he was wearing on the day he was reported missing as well.”

Authorities are still investigating the cause and manner of death.

Interestingly, the source also says that “the human remains were located in a very thick covered brush area, extremely, so you can be 10 feet away and not see it.“ People on this sub often point out how easy it is to go missing in the wilderness, so this seems like a prime example of that.",[FOUND] Body of missing United executive found a year after his disappearance
744,Bails_of_hay19,[],1635310524,"I watched a two part Dr. Phil special about this case a few days ago and haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. 

In December 2012, the Barajas family had a day out. The family consisted of father David, mother Cindy, 12 year old David Jr, 11 year old Caleb, an 8 year old girl and a 3 month old baby. After eating out the family was headed home. Approximately 100 yards from the home, their truck died. Cindy hopped in the passenger seat while David got out to push the truck home. David Jr and Caleb got out to help their dad. They wanted to prove they were strong. 

Less than a minute after a car slammed into the back of the Barajas truck. The car did not have headlights on. Bandas cousins and brother witnessed the crash. The article I’m linking says they were in a car behind Banda, but in the Dr. Phil episode David Barajas says that at least one of the men got out of the car that was involved in the crash. They say that David Barajas attacked them, David Barajas says they attacked him. After a fight with David Barajas they jump into a second car and flee the scene before officers arrived. 

A truck of teenagers pulls up and calls 911. They report that a kid had been ran over. During the call a gunshot can be heard. The teenagers do not see who fired the gun and the gunshot didn’t sound close. When police arrive David Jr is dead, Caleb is missing a leg and very quickly dying, and Jose Banda is dead in the passenger seat of the car with a gunshot wound to his head and a high BAC. Caleb later died at the hospital. 

Police search the scene and do not find a handgun. David Barajas is arrested for the murder of Jose Banda. His hands and clothes are tested for gun shot residue and those tests were negative. Police searched the Barajas home and find ammunition but no gun. 

After a trial David Barajas is found not guilty of all charges. It was proven he would not have had enough time to get home,get a gun, shoot Jose, hide the gun, and then be doing CPR on David when the police arrive. So that leaves the wuestion of who killed him? David’s lawyer alleges that either the cousin or the half brother was driving and thatJose was already dead. 

Super weird case that leaves more questions than answers.

745,QueasyTone78,[],1635308470,"I stumbled across this case when I heard the story of the ghost of an old woman that wanders around the Dunnavant Valley area in Birmingham, Alabama. I investigated the story and found that the ghost is supposedly Ann Bragg, a 76-year-old woman who vanished on Dec. 2, 1951.

According to the little information I could find, Ann set off to visit a family member who lived just through the woods. It is unclear who exactly she was going to visit, as different accounts have stated that it was a brother, a daughter, or a son. It was a path that was no longer than a quarter of a mile, and it was a route that she was very familiar with.

Her daughter became concerned when the late afternoon came and her mother had still not come home. The daughter and her family searched the woods for a while and found nothing, so they called law enforcement. The search that followed was the biggest search ever conducted in Alabama at that time.

Given that Ann may have been experiencing the early stages of dementia, it is not hard to believe that she simply got lost or wandered off. However, it is very strange that the massive land and air search, drawing hundreds of volunteers from the community and beyond, did not find a single trace of her. Not a footprint, not a shred of fabric, nothing. This could be partially due to heavy rain that fell right after she disappeared.

There are several theories, but not a single piece of evidence. Some people speculate that she may have run into moonshiners, who were prevalent in that area, and had a dangerous reputation. One rumor that has been passed around is that Ann went to see her brother, who killed her over a financial dispute. The neighbors even pointed to Ann's daughter and her husband, but the investigators quickly ruled out the 8-month pregnant woman and her husband who had been at work the whole day.

I am amazed by the lack of information on this case, considering that it was apparently a big story at the time that it happened. The only mentions of it I have found are attached below, the most notable of which is a reference to the story as a case in the Missing 411 book, ""The Devils in the Detail"". Unfortunately, I have no way of obtaining this book, so I do not know anything about the information it contains. I would also like to mention that my introduction to the case was through ""Haunted Shelby County Alabama"" by Kim Johnston, which has a little bit of information on the story in the context of explaining the ghost legend.

This case is personally fascinating, as I live in the area where she disappeared. I find it hard to imagine that she could have just vanished here without some form of foul play. The ghost legend makes the story even more strange, with the many sightings of what is supposedly the old woman's ghost serving as a grim reminder of her still unknown fate.

Samantha' eldest daughter, three year old Dezarae Carpenter, stayed at home. Samantha and her two youngest children were never seen again. 

The Carpenter family kept the same address for years in hope that Samantha would return. Although  Samantha never did, today her and her children's disappearance may finally have been solved.

It was identified as a 1989 Ford Tempo, and the police were called. There was no license plate, consistent with the case as the car was a recent purchase. The car was hoisted up onto the Pleasant View road bridge, and human remains were identified in the front seat. It is likely that Courtney is in the backseat, although confirmation is forthcoming. Samantha's family was there during the search and recovery.

747,Bisbenzimide,[],1635299147,"So sometimes I go down rabbit holes. Whether it's creeping, Dr. Google-ing yourself, etc. I was raised Catholic but my long-term boyfriend is Hindu. We're both trying to find out more history on our religions since our parents know much more. Honestly, we're both scientists, so neither of us really care so much about religion (i.e. we don't really practice or 100% belive in anything, we question a lot as scientists), but we find the stories fascinating. Today he was telling me about Diwali and its origins, so I tried telling him about the origins of Santa Claus and how they started with St. Nicholas. We watched the movie ""Klaus"" so he had some idea already, but I realized when trying to go back further in the origins I realized I truly didn't know. Flash forward to 3 hours of rabbit-holing later...I find out that he was a Santa Claus is based on the saint, Saint Nicholas (this I already knew)...St. Nicholas was a bishop originally from England (Greece at the time, but I'm also unclear if he moved to Germany)...He didn't really give toys to kids, more so money left from his wealthy parents, and used money for good deeds (later English [British] women started the tradition of putting treats and nuts and toys in socks to honor his tradition of gift giving)...Arsenic also has something to do with him, I think possibly how he was killed in 300s A.D. during the protestant reformation or something...and his body's remnants produce a relic called ""manna""...and this manna is thought to be a holy curing water but scientists really think it could simply be condensation since his tomb sits below sea level...BUT either way this manna is collected annually during St. Nicholas's celebration...AND YOU CAN LITERALLY BUY THIS LIQUID MANNA ONLINE! So when people ask me what I want for Christmas this year, I honestly really want want say (whether it's fake or not I don't care) ""bone ooze from Santa Claus"". I can literally buy it on eBay right now for $16, or Amazon for $22.

748,tllkaps,[],1635288498,"We all know the case of the Springfield Three: Sherrill Levitt, Suzie Streeter and Stacy McCall went missing from 1717 Delmar St., on the night of June 6, 1992 in Springfield, Missouri. This is probably one of the most baffling cases of missing people: a smashed torchlight, three purses lined up, lewd messages and not much else. A plethora of theories about grave robbers, a green van, and many more have since been floating out there. 

One of the theories on this case involves a sighting of Suzie driving a green van in the early hours of June 7, 1992 while being threatened by a man inside the car. The Springfield police went as far as to purchase a similar van and park it outside the station in hopes tips would come in. Nothing came of this...

I just finished listening to The Springfield Three: A Small Town Disappearance podcast (with weekly episodes from May 24-June 28, 2021). At the end of episode eight, host Anne Roderique-Jones does an Update where she states she's received many emails about theories and such.

She drops, IMO, a huge new clue: *Just today I received a DM*  f*rom the daughter of the person who owns the dentist building behind 1717 Delmar St. and here's what she told me: Her father saw the van on June 6, 1992 --- the night the three women disappeared. It was parked on his side of the fence and he immediately knew it was out of place. During this time, someone had been dumping trash on his side of the fence and he thought the people in the van might have something to do with it. So he quickly went inside to grab a pen and paper hoping to jot down the license plate number and when he got back outside they were driving away. Apparently, he saw three men about Sherrill's age and he saw Sherrill. According to this business owner they were all laughing and carrying on. He filed a police report, was quickly questioned and then nothing more.* 

*Where those the men who took the women? Was that infamous van parked behind Sherrill's the entire time?*

If her claim is true, it's safe to say Sherrill was the target and the green van theory is somewhat correct.

Only 27 years old, Tina was home with her children when an intruder broke in and stabbed her multiple times in the very early morning. 

**The day Tina was attacked.** Having just celebrated her mother's birthday the day before, Tina and her boys were at home asleep when an intruder broke in. Tina was first attacked in her bed and then managed to make it to another room where she was continually stabbed. [Detectives say that Tina was able to escape the home and run to the neighbor's home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DvfIf6aX88), where they called 911, although a newspaper [report from 1985 reports that Tina made the initial call](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/87728816/star-tribune/) from her phone and then a neighbor called.

Thankfully, her two sons, Duane and Marcellus, were unharmed in the home—and found asleep by police who canvassed the home.

I am convinced that Bryce Laspisa was not a victim a foul play. To me, it seems obvious that he was planning his disappearance beforehand whether it be suicide or leaving his old life behind. He gave his valuable possessions to his friends in the days leading to his disappearance, and he was acting strange, most likely due to the drugs he was taking. I am 50/50 whether I believe Bryce committed suicide, or started a new life. I doubt he is in the lake, as dogs tracked his scent to a nearby truck stop. He most likely hitched a ride from someone there, where he either willingly ended his own life or someone helped him begin a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary of Bryce Laspisa written by [u/wayzzzfordayzzz](https://www.reddit.com/user/wayzzzfordayzzz/)

**Early Life:**

Bryce was born on April 30, 1994, to Michael and Karen Laspisa. Bryce grew up in Illinois, graduating from Naperville Central High School in 2012. He then moved to Laguna Niguel with his parents. Bryce’s friends and family describe him as lighting up a room when he walks in, a happy guy and a gentleman. A good student and talented artist, Bryce attended Sierra College in Rocklin, California, about seven hours from his parent’s home in Laguna Niguel. Bryce studied graphic and industrial design and his work highly recognized with an extensive portfolio. A young man with a bright future ahead of him.

**Odd Behavior**

Friends of Bryce began seeing a significant change in his behavior. It was so concerning, a friend of Bryce’s called Bryce’s mother. Something was clearly troubling him, but he hadn’t talked about it to anyone.

According to the friend, Bryce began acting strange while taking ADHD medication. He began staying up all night playing video games. On August 28, 2013, Bryce had driven to Kim’s home in Chico, approximately 2 hours from his apartment in Rocklin. There both he and Kim called Bryce’s mother.

According to Investigation Discovery, Kim had tried to take his keys away because she was concerned for him. She insisted that she didn’t feel he was well enough to drive. “He told both of us the same thing,” said Bryce’s father Michael. Bryce told them he had broken up with Kim and she wouldn’t give him the keys but told his parents he was fine. “I told Bryce to let me fly up there,” Karen said. Bryce responded, “No, don’t make an airline reservation until I talk to you because I have a lot to talk to you about.”

Karen asked Kim to return her son’s keys and Bryce left at 11:30 p.m. and said he was heading home to Rocklin. He called his mother on the way. The call came in around 1:00 p.m. on August 29. Karen assumed Bryce was already at his apartment, but he wasn’t.

Later, cell phone records would indicate Bryce passed his school in Rocklin and was headed southeast toward the Castaic Mountains over 300 miles away.

**The Drive Home**

The following morning, Bryce’s parents received a message from their auto insurance, informing them Bryce’s car needed roadside assistance. Karen immediately called her son’s roommate who told her Bryce had not come home the night before.

Mike and Karen also discovered a credit card charge from Buttonwillow, California, along Interstate 5. A few hours from Niguel Laguna, his parents thought he was headed to their house.

Another charge popped up at Castro Tire and Truck Repair near the interstate. Mike contacted the shop and they told him Bryce had run out of gas. They delivered 3 gallons. Bryce happened to be still at the shop, so the man put him on the phone with his parents. Again, Bryce told his mother nothing was wrong. He said he was going to get gas and was actually on his way to their house and would be there that afternoon.

Hours went by and Bryce still hadn’t arrived.

**Police Report**

Michael and Karen made a police report to Orange County Sheriff’s Department at 6:00 p.m. that evening.

After receiving the report, the sheriff’s department pinged Bryce’s cell phone and discovered him along Interstate 5, where they searched his car and conducted a sobriety test. Officers felt Bryce was acting normally with no sign of alcohol or drugs and told him to call his mother. He was hesitant but the deputies dialed her number and put him on the phone. Again, he told his mother he was fine, so his parents were confident he was really on his way to their house this time. Hours later, Bryce again, had not returned home.

Reaching for straws, his parents called the tire and repair shop again and begged them to go where Bryce had last been seen. Knowing how worried his parents were, the man at the shop drove there to check and found Bryce was “still” at the spot the deputies had left him.

Bryce stayed in touch with his parents over the next few hours.

August 30, at approximately 2:09 a.m. Bryce told his mother he was going to pull over for the night and get some sleep.

That was the last time his mother would hear from Bryce.

**Car is Found**

The officer proceeded to inform Michael and Karen that the car had been found overturned at 5:30 a.m., at the Castaic Lake Recreation area, two hours north. It had crashed near the lake’s main boat access road and found at the bottom of a 25-foot embankment.

According to the officer, the back window had broken out from inside. Some of Bryce’s personal belongings were found inside the car to include his laptop and phone. His wallet and duffel bag were found outside.

Bryce’s blood was also found on the headrest on the passenger side of the car. However, police determined there was no evidence that he had incurred a serious injury from the wreck. Police had examined the scene and concluded Bryce had more than likely pulled off the service road that morning and heading to the rest area.

Tire tracks from the vehicle were found at the top of the embankment and they led down the bank towards Castaic Lake. The track pattern indicated that there was speed involved in the incident and that there had been no effort made to use the brakes. This led detectives to believe that Bryce was purposely trying to drive the vehicle into the lake, perhaps to take his own life.

From there, what happened to Bryce remains a mystery.

**The Search**

In the initial days that followed Bryce’s disappearance, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department conducted a massive search of the area and swept the bottom of the reservoir. Divers and helicopters searched for any trace of the young man, along with searchers on foot, horseback, and all-terrain vehicles.

Deputies also searched San Francisquito Canyon and surrounding areas with a helicopter and search dogs. Multiple blood hounds tracked Bryce’s scent to a truck stop on Castaic Road where it stopped. Shannon Tulloss said ‘Logic is usually our best friend. All the logical facts surrounding this case seem to indicate that he likely walked away from the scene. Hundreds of volunteers searched the hills and the paved access road that leads to the lake.

On September 4, 2013, a jogger found a burning body on Lake Hughes Road, near Castaic. Police determined the body was not Bryce.

After weeks of searching, on September 18, authorities called off the search. “We searched all areas of the lake and didn’t see any signs,” said Deputy Johnnie Jones of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Parks Bureau.

According to the Orange County Register, the case was turned over to the department’s homicide bureau that handles missing person cases.

**The Minutes are Excruciating**

Every time an unidentified body is found in Los Angeles County, Karen calls the detective to see if it’s her son. Then, Bryce’s parents sit for days sometimes, just waiting for an answer. For over 6 years the answers from the detective have been the same. Bryce has not yet been found.

“Bryce is in the database,” Karen said. “The DNA is there, the dental records are there, the fingerprints are there. If remains are found, we know he would be identified.”

“We still have a tip line and we still get phone calls,” Karen told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal during a 2016 interview. A Facebook page FIND BRYCE LASPISA was set up shortly after his disappearance and now has nearly 30,000 followers.

Karen and Michael’s life have gone on hold. The search for Bryce has wound down. No additional clues have surfaced.

752,Tall-Drag-8188,[],1635264432," Greetings Friends,

This is perhaps one of the greatest unsolved mysteries out there. ""What is this? Why is this? Who made this?""

I am posting this petition to gain awareness of the hypothesis as well as to eventually get the attention of the being or beings responsible for creating and maintaining the ancestor simulation, data-collection program, or super computer processing network we call our reality.

Once we have their attention our goals should be as follows:

To sincerely thank them for giving us the opportunity to exist. To even be given a chance at something over nothing is miraculous. We are not ungrateful.

To collectively voice our disapproval for the methods of data collection being used in our current simulation and to make demands that a formal apology should be issued to all participants. If not an apology, then at the very least an acknowledgement of the program and an explanation for its existence.

Once contact has been established we should ask to start an open dialogue with the being or beings with the goal of creating a new, better simulation that will work for everyone. One with respect for consent above all things.

This time it should be designed for life to thrive as conscious, creative beings instead of one rife with unnecessary cruelty and suffering. The data these beings are collecting from this simulation is no justification for the wanton brutality and callousness seemingly built into the very fabric of the program.

We did not consent to this and neither did any other being that was forcefully pulled from the nothingness and made to bear the full weight of existence and consciousness. All we ask is to be given a choice. To have our voice heard. We deserve that much.

Respectfully,

A Conscious Program

753,Kaiser_Allen,[],1635262854,"Background:

&gt;Along Pugh Street in State College on May 13, 1995, a 22-year-old Penn State student was “brutally beaten and raped” and then found in the “middle of the street” — naked from the waist down and covered in blood — early in the morning. The student’s right eye was swollen shut as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;A State College police officer responded to a “report of a female down in the roadway,” and was met by “two females” kneeling beside the Penn State student “lying on the grass beside Pugh Street.” The officer “immediately” requested an ambulance.  
&gt;  
&gt;The woman was transported to the Centre Community Hospital, now known as the Mount Nittany Medical Center, where it was determined her head injuries needed “specialized care.” The survivor was then life-flighted to Geisinger Medical Center where it was determined she suffered fractures to her skull, face and jaw. The survivor’s purse was also stolen, which contained personal belongings.  
&gt;  
&gt;A search of the surrounding area revealed several articles of the survivor’s clothing lying in a nearby flower bed, and a “significant amount of blood splattering” on the side of the nearby apartment building and its vegetation. After interviews conducted between May 16-22, 1995, the survivor could “recall very little,” but she did know she was “attacked from behind and struck in the head.” She also confirmed she did not have “consensual sexual intercourse” with anyone that morning.

&gt;Scott R. Williams, of Reedsville, has been charged with eight counts, including rape, aggravated assault and robbery, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna announced during a news conference. Williams was arrested Tuesday after being identified by investigators through genetic genealogy testing.  
&gt;  
&gt;""\[This arrest\] is a combined effort of multiple police agencies and many investigators over the course of 26 years,"" Cantorna said. Williams is accused of beating and raping a Penn State student in the early morning hours of May 13, 1995. Investigators at the time collected DNA evidence at the time but the attacker remained unknown. The evidence was filed with the FBI and in March 2000 an arrest warrant was filed for a John Doe with the DNA profile.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2018, State College Police detective Stephen Bosak called Deputy District Attorney Sean McGraw and asked for his office's support in using genetic genealogy testing. Bosak worked with detective Nicole Eckley and used two private labs to run the crime scene DNA through a genealogy test, leading the pair to identify distant relatives of their unknown suspect. Bosak and Eckley conducted numerous interviews and DNA testing until they had reconstructed a family tree that brought them, in January, to Williams's mother, who provided investigators with a DNA sample.

\--- Julie Surprenant ---

Julie Surprenant was born on the 31st of March 1983 to Michel Surprenant and Francine Desautels. By the time of the events surrounding her disappearance, she was living at 463 rue de Castille in Terrebonne, Quebec with her father. Julie's father had recently separated from her mother and thus had moved in that neighbourhood and had actually asked the landlord at the time if the neighbourhood was considered safe.

Julie was a very active teenager. At 16, she was part of her school's improv-comedy league and worked at a gift wrapper for the holidays at the Galleries Terrebonne shopping center.

\--- The evening of November 15th and the morning of November 16th ---

After school on the evening of November 15th, Julie told her father that she planned to spend most of the evening at the youth community center near the corner of Hauteville and Côte Boisée streets. She would do this often and the center was right next to the bus stop for the line she would normally take home or to work.

Her father would normally already be in bed by the time she'd get home and he trusted her to inform him if any change of plans came up, because this is what she usually did because she was a responsible kid.

However, by the time he woke up on the next morning, Julie was not home. Her father first assumed she might have headed to a friend's house that lived closer to the youth center, but there wasn't a call left on the answering machine or any indication that she had planned to do this. This is when Michel Surprenant began to feel worried.

He first called her high school while staring at the bus stop for line 25 she would be waiting at to go to school. After a number of minutes, the person at the other end of the line informed him that Julie had NOT shown up for school that morning.

Michel then called his daughter's boyfriend. He told her that on the day prior, Julie was supposed to call him once she was ready to head home so her could pick her up. But she never did and after a couple of calls to her cellphone went to voicemail, he assumed that Julie had forgotten about him and headed to bed. So he did so himself.

So based on this, her disappearance would have occured on the previous evening of the 15th.

\--- The Investigation ---

Julie's disapperance was officially notified to the police at 5:45 PM on the evening of November 16th. Immediatly, the police considered the case to be an abduction and a search was organised. The shores of the Mille-Îles river were walked and a kidnapping advisory was issue throughout Quebec.

The investigators determined that Julie left the youth center at 8:30 PM on the 15th with a friend and they borded line 25 towards her home. Her friend boarded off at the shopping center stop and saw that Julie sat at the front of the bus next to the driver. The bus driver spent the rest of the trip chatting with her and by the time she got off was the last person to see her alive. He remembers Julie getting off the bus at around 8:56 PM. As she got off, the driver remembers a man standing in the bus shelter at the stop and he asked him if he wanted to get on but the man said no and thus the bus driver drove off.

Julie lived less than a hundred metres away from the bus stop and within those hundred metres, she disappeared.

Despite the information they had gathered, the investigators were never able to determine who the man at the bus stop was and Julie's disappearance became a cold case.

\--- Richard Bouillon ---

One year later, Michel Surprenant was randomly approached by a neighbour called Richard Bouillon. Bouillon started talking to michel about how ""he had been guilty of many questionable things during his life that he felt bad for"" but insisted that ""he was not responsible for the disappearance of Julie.""

Michel was very troubled by this statement since it seemed to come out of nowhere and thus really started to wonder if Bouillon WAS in fact responsible for it.

What Michel Surprenant didn't know at the time was that Richard Bouillon had an extensive criminal record that included accusations of public indecency in '77, theft and drug possession in 1979, several more thefts in 1985 and 1986, criminal threaths in 1989, and sexual assault in 1990.

Richard Bouillon became the main suspect in the case from then on but concrete evidence on whether of not he was responsible was very hard to come by.

By 2001, a journalist started putting pressure on Richard Bouillon by confronting him with the fact that the SQ (Quebec provincial police) had searched his home and found microscopic traces of blood in his apartment. Bouillon countered with the excuse that an old roommate was responsible for those. Bouillon was so shaken up by the intervention of the journalist that he tried to quickly escape in his car and slammed the door on the journalist's arm.

The report generated many calls from previous victims of Bouillon, including the daughter of his ex-girlfriend who accused him of several molestation attempts on her. Said accusations would result in jail time for Bouillon.

\--- 2004 ---

In 2004, Michel Surprenant created the AFPAD (Families of disappeared of murdered people's association) as a way to deal with the disappearance of his daughter and help fellow parents and children of people who had vanished.

\--- Bouillon's alleged confession ---

By 2006, Richard Bouillon was still in prison but was then suffering from terminal stage cancer. He was transfered from the prison to the Cîté-de-la-Santé hospital in Laval, Quebec. Famous criminal journalist Claude Poirier believes that before his death, Bouillon confessed his crime to the priest who had been dispatched to give him his last rites, but the priest has always refused to confirm that theory citing priest-confessor privilege.

In January 2011, a one hour special was produced for Canal D about the entire affair, including the theory that Richard Bouillon might be the one responsible for Julie's disappearance. Following the broadcast of this documentary, Claude Poirier got a call from a nurse. Apparently, before his death, Bouillon had wanted to meet with Claude Poirier before he died. The staff on his unit all knew about it and had actually assumed that he had been previously in contact with Poirier and had confessed his crime to him and that the SQ had been advised. However it was clearly not the case since that was the first time Claude Poirier had heard of it. It was the first time the SQ had heard of it as well and Coroner Catherine Rudell-Tessier held a public inquiry more than eleven years after the disappearance of Julie based on this new information.

On september 2011, divers from the SQ started searching the bottom of the Mille-Iles river near highway 25's bridge where the nurse claims Bouillon told her he dumped Julie's body. However the search did not reveal anything. Which is not that surprising considering more than a decade had passed and it's very possible any remains would have been scattered very far away by the current in that time period.

Michel Surprenant publicly denounced the time it took for the nurse or her colleagues to come forward with that information. He believes that the delays caused by her dissimulating those facts wasted 6 years of investigation time and that there would have been more chances to find anything regarding the case had she or her colleagues come forward at that time.

During the following public inquiry, it was revealed that both a nurse's aide and an orderly had admited to the investigators that Bouillon had indeed stated that he was Julie's killer ON FOUR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS and that at first he had left the bag containing Julie's remains on the doorstep of the Terrebonne church before deciding to dump it in the river once he saw nobody was paying attention to it.

The Coroner made it clear in her report that the hospital personel was openly talking and were aware about Bouillon's confession and that their silence actively hindered the investigation and that the investigation would have been greatly helped by the information they were knowledgeable to. Recommendations were made to modify the laws on professional secrecy to prevent it from hindering criminal investigations in the future.

However, Claude Poirier and invetigators are puzzled by those alleged confessions since prior to that, Bouillon repeatedly denied his involvement in the case and was vehemently trying to prove his innocence.

Thus the only ""proof"" there is of Bouillon's guilt is a handful of nurses and other medical workers who only came forward with his alleged confession 11 years after the fact.

\--- In the end ---

As it stands, the disappearance of Julie Surprenant remains officially unsolved. Her body was never recovered, the main suspect is dead and secrecy might have completely eliminated the chances of ever finding out what really happened to Julie on the evening of November 15th 1999.

Funnily enough, this looks like what aeroplanes use to figure out where they are(I am not an expert in this matter, if you actually know what this means, tell me).

The murder was witnessed by a hunter in a boat, who saw the man deliver the baby then beat it to death with a rock. The biological father was also identified by DNA, but is not a suspect. The reason he is not a suspect is because the baby was biracial, which is also suspected as the motive of the killing, but the unidentified male accomplice was Caucasian.

When Herman and his family returned home that Tuesday afternoon, they found their market closed and locked. This immediately struck them as odd, as Anna was supposed to open the store that morning. They unlocked the building's front door and went inside, however saw no sign of Anna. When Herman entered her bedroom, he was met with a nightmarish scene. Anna’s lifeless body lay sprawled out on her bed, nude, beaten, and covered in burns. 

Police were summoned to the scene immediately. Initially, the coroner believed that perhaps Anna, who had a history of fainting spells, had fallen onto a hot plate that was found near her bedside, however after a proper autopsy was conducted, her cause of death proved to be much more disturbing. 

Anna had severe burns on her back and neck as well as deep bruising on her shoulders, chest, legs, head, and face. Both of her wrists and ankles showed evidence of being bound with rope or wire and cuts and welts thought to be the result of a “lashing” were found along her legs. 

Burned flesh and hair was found on both a cast iron skillet, as well as the hot plate in Anna’s bedroom. It is believed her killer burned her with both items. It was also concluded that at some point, a large amount of hot grease had been poured onto Anna’s back and neck. Two fireplace pokers were also taken in as evidence, however it was never revealed if they were used in the attack on Anna. Anna’s bloodstained dress was found on her bedroom floor, along with a grease stained rag. The coroner concluded that Anna’s cause of death was a combination of the burns and shock. He determined she had not been sexually assaulted. 

The only thing that initially appeared to be missing from the home was Anna’s door key. There were only two doors into the building, and Herman was adamant that both doors were locked when he arrived home that afternoon. However, a second search of the home resulted in the missing key being found in a small pocketbook of Anna’s. The locks on the back door were spring loaded, and would automatically lock when someone left, leading police to believe that perhaps Anna had opened the door for her killer, and he had exited through the back door. 

Herman told investigators that he and his wife and children had departed on Saturday around noon for Brookeville and arrived home in Covington on Tuesday around noon. A neighbor of the Bishops named Theresa Delaney reported seeing Anna on Sunday evening standing in the back doorway of the building, however after that, no one reported seeing her or anyone suspicious around the area. 

Anna’s father revealed that five years prior, he had employed a local middle aged man to work in his market. While in his employment, Herman learned that the man was having an intimate relationship with Anna. Anna had gotten pregnant, however she lost the baby a short time after giving birth. The man had offered to marry Anna, but reportedly Herman refused to allow this to happen and fired the man. Police brought the man in for questioning who claimed he had not seen Anna in some time. He did not deny their previous relationship, and willingly submitted to a polygraph test. He passed the test and was released a short time later. (He is never named.)

Multiple “known local degenerates” were brought in for questioning and issued polygraphs, as well as a neighbor of the Bishops, 49-year-old Harry Fraser,  who had a history of “delinquency.” Although no arrests were made, in a bizarre twist of fate Harry was shot twice at point blank range near his home 2 years later. His murder was never solved. 

Sadly, with little evidence, no sure motive, and no real suspects, Anna’s case quickly turned cold. Herman continued to search for answers about his daughter's death, however he passed away just four years later. Anna’s murder was never solved.

The Oregon State Police  has announced the identification of 1971 Coos Bay John Doe as 15-year-old Winston Arthur Maxey III. 

Winston left his home in Boise, Idaho during the Spring of 1971 to hitchhike to Oregon in search for work. His family never heard from him again. He was recovered deceased in Coos Bay, Oregon a few months later but he remained unidentified for the past 5 decades. 

Winston, before leaving Idaho, had unknowingly fathered a child. That child was ultimately given up for adoption and grew up in Idaho. Upon turning 18, Winston’s daughter hired a private investigator to locate her biological parents. After learning of her biological parent’s names, she contacted her biological mother, learning her father’s name which had not been included on the birth certificate; Winston Arthur Maxey III.

In 2016, Winston’s daughter began pursuing avenues of locating her father, not knowing whether or not he was alive, and having no knowledge of his potential location. She set up a Facebook page, “Where in the world is Winston Maxey”. She also filed an official missing person’s report and began working with local law enforcement officials.

Recently, Oregon authorities partnered with Parabon and through forensic genealogy efforts was able to give him back his name and start to provide some answers to his searching family.

Today, 10/25/21 the Cook County Sheriff's Office announced that one of the 6 unidentified victims of serial killer John Wayne Gacy has been identified. Francis Wayne Alexander lived in the area of other Gacy victims and was 21 when he was murdered. His remains were found in the crawl space underneath Gacy's house.

Francis Wayne Alexander, originally from NC, got his name back thanks to genetic genealogy and the amazing work done by the DNA Doe Project. Within 8 hours of getting the DNA information, the DNA Doe Project was able to identify a potential family, which was later confirmed as the victims relatives. Francis Wayne Alexander is survived by his mother and 4 half-siblings. 

Hopefully the remaining victims can be identified!

The case of Michael Hughes is really sad. He got kidnapped from school by Franklin Delano Floyd and has never been found.

After some digging, it was determined that Floyd had also abducted Michael’s mother Suzanne Sevakis at a young age. He originally posed as her father, but when she got older he married her. Police have found photos of a young Suzanne in sexually explicit photos in Floyd’s possession. Suzanne was later killed in a suspicious hit and run accident. Floyd is the main suspect. Floyd was also charged with murdering a coworker of Suzanne’s.

Michael was placed in foster care. He originally had a lot of issues, but had improved greatly with his foster family. They were planning to adopt him.

Floyd has admitted to FBI agents that he killed Michael, but no remains have ever been found.

762,PrimeVector19,[],1635175635,"A much lesser-known missing persons case that is also featured on The Charley Project website as the Missing Person of the Week, Cecil O. Baker is a man from Kentucky who has been missing since May 1st, 2011. 

Baker’s last confirmed sighting occurred in Barbourville, Kentucky. He said he was going to visit has daughter in Michigan, but whether he ever made it to Michigan - or if he even made it out of Kentucky - remains unknown to this day, 10 years since his abrupt disappearance. 

In addition to Baker himself, his vehicle - a lime-green four-door 1994 Geo Metro with the Kentucky license plate number 474CDH - is also missing. Frequently with missing persons cases, an abandoned vehicle is discovered. But that is not the case here, which only exacerbates the perplexing nature of Baker’s disappearance. 

Family members have claimed that Baker would never leave without warning, and they also believe he encountered harm. 

Baker’s sister, Darlene Rice, said in a May 2017 interview that Baker “was a good person, he was likable. Anybody that met him, liked him.” 

Rice went on to say this: “Every morning and of the evening, I sit out here with the sun going down and I think about him so bad. My husband passed away two years ago but I know where my husband’s at. He’s right down the road in the cemetery. But my little brother… I don’t know where he’s at.” 

Having grown up in a family of 13 children, Rice said she was the oldest while Cecil was the youngest. Rice has faith that she will know what happened one day. 

Unfortunately, aside from Cecil O. Baker’s sister and daughter, there is nothing else available about his personal life. 

Cecil O. Baker is listed as being between 5’10-6’0, and 185-200 pounds. He was 47 years old at the time of his disappearance. He had recently cut his hair and shaved, and is a white male with hazel eyes. He has two tattoos; one is the name “Tammy” with a heart underneath it on the inside of his right forearm, and the other is of a bird. He wears prescription glasses with black frames.

After World War 1, Isidor Fink, a Polish immigrant settled in the US in hope of a better life. After many years of toiling, Isidor finally had enough money to start his own business. He rented the 1st floor of a building at No.4 East 123nd street in New York to start his own laundry business. At the time, it would seem that things were looking up for this Polish immigrant but destiny took a sudden turn and his name would be become famous for a very tragic reason.

East 123nd was infamous at the time due to the rampant crime. Isidor was a very careful man, as such, he would lock his door almost all the time, even the window would always be locked. Strangers would not be allowed inside, only customers he knew were admitted inside. 

On March 9th 1929, at 10:15, after delivering laundry, Isidor returned to his quarter (which was attached to the laundry) and locked his doors as usual. Around 10:30, Ms. Locklin Smith, a neighbor of Mr. Isidor, heard a sudden scream and sound of people struggling but no gunshot. She quickly called the police.

Shortly afterward, when a nearby police officer arrived, Mr. Isidor's laundry shop was completely silent. The main door was locked and the window was bolted shut. Only a single small transom with a broken hinge connected the room with the outside, however, the transom was too small for any adult to enter. 

In the end, the police had to ask a child to climb through the transom and open the door from the inside. Mr. Isidor was found dead on the floor with 3 gunshot wounds, two on the chest and one on the wrist. The hot iron and lighted stove suggested Mr. Isidor was hard at work when he was attacked. 

What baffled the police was the complete lack of evidence, including the murder weapon. The shop was not robbed, all valuables were left untouched. There is no sign of the house being ransacked. It would seem that there was no apparent motive for murder.

The next question is how did Mr. Isidor die? Traces of gunpowder were found near the victim wrist which suggested that he was shot from point blank range and that the shot was made when Mr. Isidor went for the gun. No fingerprint except that of Mr. Isidor was found at the crime scene. Thinking that this might be some elaborate suicide, the police looked for some contraption that would allow such a suicide but none was found. The police were desperate and even looked for a hidden passage way in the walls, floorboards, everything but to no avail.

The only conclusion drawn by the police was that Mr. Isidor was murdered but as to who killed him and how, more than 90 years later, there is still no answer. The case of Isidor Fink is considered to be an example of the perfect murder and one of history unresolved mysteries.

**Thoughts**

While this is a certainly a mystery, it is not hard to come up with theories as to what happened to Mr. Isidor. Here are some of my thoughts on the case:

1. Perhaps the police were simply incompetent and didn't investigate properly or maybe they were corrupted and bribed by the killer and whoever was backing him.
2. A prominent theory is that Mr. Isidor was shot in the hallway and got into his room and locked the door behind him. However, the examiner determined that the 2 shots to the chest would have been instant death leaving Mr. Isidor no time to run away. (However, the article did mentioned an example of a man who shot himself in the head, blew out a portion of his brain and still lived for a few hours, perhaps this is a similar case of a near death superhuman endurance?) Also, Mr. Isidor was a very cautious man who never opened his door for strangers, them being in a struggle would suggest that Mr. Isidor opened the door and therefore, knew his killer. 

But in the end, these are nothing more than speculations, we may never know what happened on that fateful day. How about you guys? Please let me hear your thoughts on the case.

There is something very sad and haunting watching her in the elevator footage from the Cecil hotel. Essentially watching a young woman struggle with her condition, and the unfortunate aftermath  that was revealed to be her fate. 

Another that has always stuck with me is watching the person that murdered Missy Bevers walk around the halls of the church was so eerie. The person in the footage did not seem to be in a hurry, or concerned with police showing up.  As they open a bunch of doors and presumably make a good bit of noise. The swat gear worn by the person in the video made it all the more chilling as it shows the level to which this person planned everything.

Renewed appeal for assistance in identifying human remains discovered on Ballinamona beach, Kilmuckridge, on 12 December 1995.


Foul play ruled out after a post-mortem examination, cause of death determined to be drowning.

A pathologist reported the remains to be a woman aged between 25 to 40. She was around 176cm in height, with extensive dental treatments, including a brace fitted on her bottom teeth.

She was discovered wearing a pair of blue 'Lee' jeans - that were sized 33/31 - and size 39 brown shoes with white socks. Two Volkswagen keys were also recovered in the pocket of the jeans.

Despite exhaustive inquires at the time through international policing channels, including Interpol and missing persons organisations, the woman was never identified.

She was interred at Crosstown Cemetery in Wexford in May 1996.

In November 2007, an exhumation was carried out and a DNA sample was taken &amp; uploaded onto Interpol database for comparison with profiles from missing persons worldwide, but to date no matches identified.

767,NDN2021,[],1635087876,"The area of Ladywood near the centre of the city of Birmingham UK, has been an area that has gone many changes over the years. This was an area that was a former slum area of the city, and over time developed into housing developments for those in need and today more modern and new housing. 

Alston Street now is a different place it was a hundred years ago, and 47 years when this horrible crime happened. The street now only measures 149 meters and despite a few more 1960s build houses; it only really leads into B4124 which leads to the Ladywood Circus Road. In 1974, the area was covered in derelict Victorian era houses and was part of a compulsory purchase order by Birmingham City Council in 1969. Many of the homes were empty and had few residing. 

Early in the morning on the 7th of June 1974, dye-caster factory worker Intaz Ali, 39 (or 35 as some sources say) originally from Bangladesh was heading home after a night-shift at work at 6:30am. He was seen by an occupant of the multi-occupancy house at 8:30am. Sadly, this would be the last sighting of him alive. 

Later that day, Intaz was discovered by his aunt in his room. He had been stabbed to death and had multiple stab wounds. A rear window had been smashed and his bedroom door forced open. Whilst Intaz showed signs of a struggle against his killer, he sadly was murdered. Eyewitness reports from the few neighbours living on Alston Street said they did see a man around in the area at the time the deceased had returned home. 

Detectives working on the case were already stretched with resources working on another unsolved murderer around two to three months earlier of Barbara Forest who was killed in the Erdington area of the city. They appealed to the public that the attacker would have been heavily blood-stained around the Ladywood area and spoke with bus drivers across the city who may have seen any sighting of Intaz and his murderer within the area. The police also pleaded with former neighbours (both houses either side were derelict and empty) and spoke to any associates within the Bangladeshi community and his workplace if they have any information to help catch his killer. The police did state that the cases were not linked. 

Sadly the case remains unsolved to this day and interestingly no photo was released of Intaz at all. There was any artists sketch of the murderer too. All the efforts from West Midlands Police were in vain, and his killer is still evading justice to this day. Nobody at all came forward and nobody was questioned at all. 

Very little information about this case is online, and I have retrieved information from the British Newspaper Archive which has a few articles on the case in the Birmingham Daily Post. This really is a mysterious and obscure case and it seemed it was forgotten about extremely quickly.

Was this a robbery gone wrong? Did someone take the chance of the road being derelict or a ""twilight area"" as the press called it to carry out a random attack? Was he followed home that morning by his killer? A potential racist attack perhaps? Or perhaps someone with a grudge either an ex-partner, ex-tenant or even a current tenant? So many unanswered questions.

Unfortunately, due to the age of the case and the lack of any leads within the investigation it's likely this will never be solved. The killer may no longer be alive, and any witnesses, associates and family would sadly be long deceased or not of a sound mind even.

There’s more on there but I found this thread in a comment to an old post about Bradley’s disappearance. Most of the disappearances were in the 90s, including Suzanne Streeter (Springfield Three), Tracie Mosley, and Jennifer Regan. Most are white American women, but some are other races or from Canada or Europe, and many disappeared under the age of 18. The most recent disappearance was Irina Mizurska (Italy) in 2011. If this is true I’d have to guess that some wealthy, influential, Epstein-like figure is behind this ring. One thing that stands out is that the website surfaced around 2004-5, and most of the disappearances were in the 90s or later but the makeup and hair styling is almost always very 80s looking (like with Bradley/Jas.

772,WhiteBoyWitACatitude,[],1634938863," Hello!  I had previously asked this over in AskReddit, but it didn't get any  responses. The next text is just lifted from that post.

I am trying to identify an episode of Unsolved Mysteries that opens up with a arson clip and than moves to a robbery clip. The re-creation footage has two robbers running out of a store that is really small, with maybe the camera sliding to the right to reveal a dead body behind a cashier. The perspective was very much like a side-scrolling video game. I think the robbers also ran to a getaway car. I distinctly remember Robert Stack saying that ""this is a crime YOU can help solve!"" Both cases (the arson and robbery) were unrelated.

I've  tried searching the wikia for that episode, but there's a lot to go through, and episodes are also mislabeled online. Again, thanks ahead to anyone who responds to this! Also, here is a link to the wikia robberies page I tried searching through.

Earlier this year the US govt released a [report about Unidentified Aerial Phenomena](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf) (pdf). I read up on the behaviours that are sometimes seen, and got the impression that somehow something with time distortions was going on. Some examples are:

* The Rendlesham case, where someone touched a craft and claimed to have received a message from the year 8100
* Sightings involving missing time, memory problems, strange synchronicities
* The tic-tac craft that seemed to know the location of a ""secret"" CAP point
* Abduction cases where people are shown or warned about future events
* Craft behaviour like acceleration, transmedium travel, low observability
* Etc.

I wanted to know if ""time"" had something to do with these, and if so how could it explain them. There are alot of ""aliens are us from the future"" theories, but I wanted to actually understand what time is, and what the possibilities are. So I read some books about time, didnt understand half of it (im not a physicist) and felt that things I did read, didnt match with the real world (such as ""no free will"" or ""many worlds with copies of yourself and the universe in each""). 

I started from scratch and just explored some ideas. Please read the diagram (or watch the video).

**A quick recap about the case :** 20-30 y.o man found on a beach in Malibu on january 2nd, 1986. Recognizable face, fully clad. Died 1 or 2 days prior to recovery. All clothes originated from Europe. He had a pouch with swiss francs and US dollars in it which was found in the right pocket of his jeans. 

**Toxicology reveals something a little unexpected.** Though most redditors (including myself) thought he must have been drunk or on drugs (considering the fact he probably died on New Year's eve, as said by the coroner) ; he was actually not on drugs at all and had only 0.02% of alcohol in his blood which is very few (2 beers max I would say ?) 

The autopsy report contains other elements that drew my attention :

**in the external examination :** 

""Tied around the neck quite tightly up under the chin above the Adam's  apple is a double wrap of cloth, cotton-like grey with vertical black  and light red stripes which is attached through the handles of a plastic  shopping bag like device. The bag is approx 13.5 to 15 inches, the bottom half has been eroded or chipped open. The material itself appears to have been taken from something like a sports shirt or some such  device""

and 

""on the side of the left sock is a band of cloth, blue with white and red stripes which has been tied in granny knots, forming a loop approximately 7-8 inches in diameter.""

and

""initial examination of the teeth show no defects except the left upper central incisor has a chipped occlusal surface which appears fresh"". 

**in the internal examination :**

The dura is stripped to the base and there is no evidence of fracture but there is evidence of hemorrhage into the mastoid air cells. 

**""Diagnosis : 1. Drowning. ""**

**""Opinion : This young man drowned at best shown from autopsy evidence. The circumstances leading up to this and the manner of death are undetermined. ""**

&amp;#x200B;

My questions : 

**What do you think is that piece of fabric tied to a plastic bag around his neck ? There is no lesion on the neck related to it but this sounds extra weird IMO. Sex thing ? Weird necklace ? Drowning device ?** Same thing for the item attached to his sock (I still don't understand how it can be tied on the ""side"" of a sock btw)

Also, Why are the mastoid air cells bleeding ?

To me, what was most interesting was that this wasn’t really a serious hike, and were experienced hikers “who once went backpacking in the Himalayas”, and yet even they died from the elements. 

I think this is really important to keep in mind with a lot of unresolved mysteries that trails and “the wilderness” can be so so dangerous, and that even people with experience are at risk.

777,SaladAndEggs,[],1634861918,"**Background**

Tom Brown was an 18 year old who went missing the night before Thanksgiving, November 23, 2016. Tom had spent the night with friends, cruising around his small hometown of Canadian, TX. When he didn’t arrive home by his midnight curfew, the search began almost immediately. His vehicle was found at 8:30 the following morning at a water treatment facility, but there was no sign of Tom. His partial remains were found by a Sheriff’s deputy on January 9, 2019 nearly 12 miles from the location of his vehicle. Testing of the recovered remains could not determine a cause of death.  

There are far too many details to the case to cover here. It was the subject of a phenomenal podcast done by Skip Hollandsworth for Texas Monthly. Skip also did an AMA about a year ago. 

**10/20/2021 Update**  

Several weeks ago, the PI firm hired by Tom's mother Penny announced that on 10/20/21 they would be holding a presentation to present all of the information they had collected. The night before the Klein presentation, the Office of the Attorney General of Texas released a 249 page [summary of the investigation to date.]( https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/images/Cold%20Case%20Missing%20Person%20Unit%20Press%20Packet.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=) While much of the timeline and information was previously known, there were several parts that I thought were interesting. 
	
**Luminol Test** - During initial searches of Tom’s vehicle, a spot of blood was discovered. Philip Klein later made a big deal about a Luminol test he performed on the Durango. According to Klein, there was blood found all over the vehicle. Pictures from Klein’s test are included in the AG’s document and do show a reaction on a good portion of the interior of the Durango. According to the AG’s report, however, there was a second spot *“only known by investigators…[that] was not discovered, photographed, or mentioned”* by the Klein report. The second spot of blood was positively identified as Tom’s blood. Klein has always promoted the idea that Tom was murdered with this test being the only real piece of “evidence” supporting that idea. Obviously this point by the AG’s office should dismiss any sort of trust that the Luminol test was accurate.  

**Tom’s Phone** – As you may remember, Tom’s phone was found in October, 2017 in a ditch several miles from the vehicle. The phone was found in a ditch and was discovered very early into a search organized by the Meek family &amp; Klein. According to the AG’s report:

&gt; The phone was in almost perfect condition- no scratches, nicks etc. FBI confirmed the moisture indicators had not been activated on the phone. Although it is not impossible the phone had been outside since November 24, 2016, it is not probable. The area where the phone was found had been recently mowed and had been mowed several times over the summer. Hemphill County received approximately 26 inches of rain from November 24, 2016 to October 14, 2017. There was also a severe ice storm on January 15, 2017.

&gt; PENNY MEEK texted a witness in January of 2017 asking if their child knew the passcode to THOMAS BROWN’S phone and clarified this was a four-digit number. The child began asking numerous friends if they had the passcode. The circumstances surrounding the passcode created misinformation that HCSO had asked for the passcode in 2017. The investigative team has confirmed that HCSO did not ask the family for the passcode in 2017.
	
&gt; The digital forensic evidence indicates that it is more likely than not the battery case was on THOMAS BROWN’S phone the night of his disappearance. The phone records show a “plug in”/charging event earlier in the evening while THOMAS BROWN was at his house. There is never an “unplug” event the rest of the evening suggesting that the “plug in” event was the result of the built-in battery charging case attached to the phone and not another type of charging source that would require an “unplug” event before relocating the phone. Further evidence to support this theory are that THOMAS BROWN’S friends stated he was religious about keeping his phone charged and that he almost always had his battery charging case on the phone

Obviously, the condition and location of the phone don’t add up. This has long been a major point of discussion surrounding the case. But the addition of the latter two would suggest that the family had Tom’s phone until it was planted right before the search. The report later states that Penny Meek has told investigators that she has had the charging case since the disappearance but has not turned it over. 

**Gregory Search** – There has always been a suspicion that Pyne Gregory was involved in some sort of cover up because he was the first deputy to help search for Tom and was also the one to find his skull. At one point in the podcast it is noted that while Tucker Brown was riding with Gregory looking for Tom, they passed the water treatment facility and Gregory essentially refused to enter the property to look. According to the AG’s report, this is false. Video shows that no vehicle drove past the facility between the time Tucker joined Gregory and when Tom’s Durango is shown entering. Additionally, Tucker texted Penny at 5:47AM that they had driven out to Tom’s ex-girlfriend’s house, the Y, and the lake and had not found anything. He was dropped off at 5:56AM, one minute before Tom’s Durango was recorded entering the water treatment plant.

The AG's report does say that there is more information &amp; evidence not contained in the summary and that this was just released in response to many of the issues that Klein has raised with the investigation. I think I've leaned towards an accident or suicide that was covered up by the family and much of the information in the AG's summary seems to reinforce that for me.

778,CorruptedMind341,[],1634843307,"I'm new to this subreddit so I'm not certain if **speculations** or theories are allowed here. But I feel the need to make this a post instead of just a comment. So here goes...

**Summary:** [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5wzz/house-of-secrets-burari-deaths-netflix-show-india)[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/web-series/house-of-secrets-the-burari-deaths-review-new-netflix-show-goes-beyond-gory-details-re-examines-case-that-gripped-the-nation-101633689279098.html)   
In July of 2018, in the Burari district of Dehli, India, eleven members of a single family, spanning three generations, were found dead. Ranged in age from 12 to 80, ten had been hanged from a grating in the ceiling of the first floor roof, with their mouths gagged and their hands bound and the last, the grandmother was found strangled at the side of the bed. Initially, it was suspected to be a case of mass murder but eventually further evidence such as diaries and relatives' stories proved otherwise. Officially the police ruled it a mass suicide.  

**What bothers me:**  
After watching the [Netflix documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/81095095), it is said that Lalit, the youngest son of the grandmother was the one who lead the family to their demise. It is said he had Psychosis and PTSD. I am bothered by this because as a Psychology student, I learned that psychosis is just a symptom and not an actual illness. Also, people with PTSD don't have the power to make their family commit mass suicide. Though it does indeed need an actual psychologist to see a patient's behaviors and hear the patient's experiences to truly know what they have, the investigating psychiatrists could have still delved in deeper on it and not just call it as a power play by making them believe he was communicating with their dead father.

Things mentioned that piqued my interest.

1. Lalit suffered **head trauma** in a motor accident.
2. He was **attacked** by his employer by burning the shop he was **locked** in, then causing him to have **PTSD** and **lose his voice** for three years.
3. After the **death of their father**, he was able to speak in their **father's voice** and act similarly with his tone, mannerisms and all.
4. It is also said that Lalit is the **sole earning member of the family.**
5. In the diaries, it has entries that say the **father** has made a lot of **visits**.
6. Relatives mentioned that Lalit seemed **different,** **uneasy, or spacing out.**

This means brain injury + PTSD + grief from the loss of a father + pressure to financially support the family (while having experienced a peculiar loss of voice that wasn't really explained which might say that he has subconsciously believed he lost his voice) just made him snap. Psychosis is indeed one of the huge symptoms here. Being voiceless means he's more prone to be in silence thus more prone to hearing voices.

However Psychosis is also a symptom of **Dissociative Identity Disorder** (Split/Multiple Personality Disorder) which personally explains a lot.

1. People who experienced **head injuries** are more likely to dissociate than people who haven't.
2. Dissociation is very common with people who have **PTSD**.
3. Dissociating into a split personality often includes a **change of voice**.
4. One cause of DID is it is developed as a **coping style** that helped during distress and the use of splitting as a **survival skill**.
5. DID means **two or more alternate identities are in control** within the same person.
6. One symptom of DID is having episodes of feeling **disconnected or detached from one's body and thoughts.**

There's no way these aren't proof enough. His past injuries made his psyche so messed up that his mind started to falter. The loss of his father created grief so deep that it made him not let go of his father to the point he subconsciously created a separate identity which he thought was his father talking to him from the afterlife.

The change of his voice and his family's strong faith must have been enough to convince them to think that he is indeed possessed by his father. His 3 years of writing as communication when he lost his voice was basically training him to write 11 years worth of diary entries. And no I don't think Latit and his wife were just fooling everyone for their own gain cause I think they actually believed in all of it as well cause if they didn't, then they wouldn't have participated in the **mass suicide**. They truly believe that their **ritual** will bring back their father to untie them. Lalit was desperate enough to risk all of their lives for the sake of **bringing his father back.** What a tragic end to their family",House of Secrets: The Burari Deaths.

780,JoyIkl,[],1634807312,"**The finding of the body**

Late afternoon of February 28th 1989, Fukushima, Japan, a 23 years old female teacher noticed something strange while going to the toilet. It was an old type of toilet that required the user to squat down. The woman saw a shoe when she looked into the pit. She went outside to open to the lid of the tank only to find a human foot sticking out. Horrified, she screamed for help and later, one of her coworker called the police. The body was removed from the tank covered in waste. After the body was washed, the victim was quickly identified by the local as 26 years old Naoyuki Ogino.

**The bizzare position of the body and how it got there**

The toilet was an an old and simple model. The septic tank was shaped like a sharp U. One pipe is for waste to come in, the other is for the cleaner to remove and clear the waste. The diameter of the cleaning pipe was 14 inch (36 cm), the height of the pipe was 42 inch (107 cm) the flat pipe at the bottom was 18 inch (47 cm) high and 49 inch (125 cm) long (refer to the link for a diagram of the U pipe). Naoyuki was found lying on the flat bottom portion of the pipe. The position he was found in baffled people. Naoyuki was lying on his back with his legs folded upward like he was in a fetal position. What is even more strange is that even though it was winter, Naoyuki did not have his shoes or shirt on. Instead, Naoyuki was found holding his neatly folded shirt to his chest.

What is even more fascinating was that Naoyuki was 5 ft 7 (170 cm) with the shoulder length of 16 inch (40 cm) which means Naoyuki had to squeeze himself into the pipe with great difficulty. The firefighter and police struggled to get the body out in vain, in the end, they had to destroy the entire pipe to remove body. This shows that it is quite impossible for some one else to put the body into the pipe in such a strange position.

**Details regarding the victim**

The body was found on February 28th, however, the autopsy showed that Naoyuki died 2 days earlier on the 26th. Naoyuki himself was reported to have gone missing on the 24th after he told his father was going to run some errands. 

Naoyuki Ogino was a promising and reputable young man living in the region. He was well known among the local. Naoyuki worked as a sales manager of a company supporting a nearby Nuclear Power Plants. According to the local, he was an upstanding and reliable person which is why both his father and the villagers were outraged when the police concluded that Naoyuki had died while trying to peep at  women in the bathroom.

4000 signatures were collected by the local to petition the police to reopen the case. However, the police denied the request and the case remains ambiguous.

**Unexplained details**

1. **The shoe:**  
One of the shoe was found in the pipe above Naoyuki's head which was also the one the teacher saw when she discovered the body. Yet the second shoe was not there, instead, it was found on the river bed of a river quite some distance away from the location the body was found. The position of the first shoe was also strange since it was found near the head of the body and directly under the toilet which suggests that it would be more likely that the shoe was dumped from the toilet rather than Naoyuki had it with him when he climbed in.
2. **The shirt:**  
Naoyuki was found holding to this chest a shirt. The shirt was clean and neatly folded. The space inside the pipe was so limited that it was impossible to fold the shirt like that. As such, the shirt must have been folded before entering the pipe.
3. **Cause of death:**  
According to the police, the cause of death was hypothermia. Beside some scratches, there was no traumatic injuries. 
4. **The car:**  
Naoyuki's car was found near by with the key still in and the door unlocked. 

**Theories**

There has been no shortage of theories regarding the case. 

First of all, the female teacher who found the body knew Naoyuki, he helped her with a case of harassment before. This coincidence and the fact that she was able to see the shoe in the poorly lit toilet and opened the lid to the tank instead of calling for help raised some suspicion but none of which was concrete.

There was an accident at the nuclear power plant Naoyuki was working at some time before, in which, one of his coworkers committed suicide.

Just before his death, there was a village chief election with different people running with opposing opinions on the nuclear power plant.

All of this gave rise to multiple theories as to what could be behind Naoyuki bizzare death.

**Conclusion**

This is one of the most bizzare cases i have ever come across. From the evidences, we can at least make a few concrete conclusions about cases. 

For unknown reasons, Naoyuki, who was wearing a pant, one shoe and holding his neatly folded shirt to his chest, decided to squeeze himself into a small pipe of a women bathroom septic tank and then died there of hypothermia. He didn't even try to use his shirt to cover himself. Even if he was desperately trying to peep at women, it would still be an extremely foolish thing to do since the toilet was poorly lit so nothing could be seen. Furthermore, no man in his right mind would try to climb into such a tight space, not to mention the smell would have been unbearable, it would have been impossible to escape. It is impossible to turn in such a narrow space and the other pipe was even smaller, at around 8 inch (20 cm), climbing into the pipe would have been clear suicide, and not a pretty one. All of this should have been common knowledge to Naoyuki. 

For whatever reason it could have been, we may never know what truly happened to Naoyuki.

The Jamison Family lived in Eufaula OK, United States. They began speaking to spirits inside their home. Later on they reported that they had seen demons inside their home. Also friends of the Jamisons who visited the home saw strange occurances inside the house. One friend would see a gray mist coming down the stairs towards her. The Jamisons asked their pastor to come investigate the home. Later on the pastor would remark that the Jamisons were indeed invovled in spiritual warfare. Meaning that the pastor must have witnessed something bizaare within the Jamisons home. The Jamisons mysteriously disappeared on October 8, 2009. The family was reportedly considering the purchase of a forty-acre plot of land on Panola Mountain, about 30 mi (48 km) from Eufaula, at the time of their disappearance. Their remains were found in November 2013 and positively identified by the Oklahoma medical examiner on July 3, 2014.

There are about 4 or 5 theories of what may have happened to the family that get repeated over and over. However when we take a look at the evidence and facts, none of those theories really make sense and they can not be proven. So me and a friend did some research about the case and upon reading various news articles we arrived at a new theory. Its good to think outside the box. We used only the facts, to form our own theory as to what may have happened to the Jamison Family. And i stress that we used only facts because there is content out there claiming that the daughter (madyson) had been ""playing with angels"" for example. This is untrue. According to eyewitness reports from friends and relatives of the Jamison Family, the daughter Madyson was speaking to spirits inside the home. Now this false info ""playing with angels"" compared to the truth ""speaking to spirits"" are two entirely different things. It is important that we do not mix up the story like this just because we may have some agenda to present the daughter Madyson as a saint by saying she was playing with angels. Im not sure why there is some content claiming this, perhaps because she was a young girl and they think shes cute and is capable of doing no wrong? According to the evidence and eyewitness reports she had been speaking to spirits, now this can mean angels but it can also mean that she was speaking to demons. It is more likely that she was speaking to the latter because of other evidence in the case, which is all covered in the video. Alot of evil things were happening at the home including demon sightings. This may have driven the family mad and it caused them to want to move out. Why else would they want to leave a beautiful and expensive lake home on waterfront property and then go live in a conex box (storage container) on a mountain?

The family was reportedly considering the purchase of a forty-acre plot of land near on Panola Mountain, about 30 mi (48 km) from Eufaula, at the time of their disappearance. Their suspected remains were found in November 2013 and positively identified by the Oklahoma medical examiner on July 3, 2014. No cause of death was determined, and the other theories could not be proven.

785,thenightitgiveth,[],1634780885,"This is obviously an internet/psychological mystery. The other day I saw a tweet that said “you don’t have to be the biggest fan of Barney to acknowledge that some of the vitriol directed towards him in parody songs was disproportionate.”

Of course, everyone in the mentions started reminiscing about that classic remix of “Joy to the World,” and I found it amusing that every zoomer/late millennial in the English-speaking world somehow had a version of it floating around their elementary school. 

The internet undoubtedly played a role in its spread, but obviously 15 years ago social media wasn’t what it is now, and kids didn’t have as much access to personal devices. Not to mention, the origins of these songs date back to the early nineties, long before the average person had internet.  

Non-technological factors also existed. Kids shared it with their cousins who went to other schools. Someone even suggested that military brats played a key role because they’re always moving from place to place, and, well, round and round it goes.

To what extent do you think each possible factor (internet, word of mouth, or the collective unconscious) ranked into the spread of these songs?

Can you think of any similar memetic fads, for example that weird S kids have always liked to draw? How do you think those memes spread?

""ST. CHARLES, Mo.– Nearly 30 years after the so-called “I-70 killer” terrorized the Midwest, St. Charles Police have released an updated aged-enhanced photo to try and generate new leads in the cold case.

The law enforcement agencies involved with the case plan to have a meeting next month to discuss the investigation. There is a $25,000 reward that is still being offered for information involving the case.

Authorities believe the killer stopped along the interstate and looked generally for women working by themselves.

Four of the murders were at small shops along Interstate 70 – two in Missouri, two in Indiana. The other two were at a bridal shop near Interstate 35 in Wichita, Kan. He is also possibly being considered for crimes in Texas.


Police believe the man is now between age 52 and 70. His hair could be a different color now.

A witness to the St. Charles crime had a good look according to videos posted on the St. Charles CrimeStoppers website. At the time he was described as a white male in his mid-thirties, about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, slender to medium build with light brown to auburn colored hair.

FOX4KC.com reports one of the better descriptions of the suspect came from an eye-witness in Raytown, Mo. A video store owner in a strip mall where one of the shootings happened saw a man enter a neighboring gift shop then heard a pop. A grocery store clerk saw a man climb a hill to I-70 and disappear. The video store owner found the body of 37-year-old Sarah Blessing inside the gift shop.

Potential Weapon
FOX2Now.com reports that police say he used a most unusual weapon that has been linked to five other murders. Officials say based on ballistic evidence and witness statements, the gun was .22-caliber, possibly an Intratec Scorpion or an Erma Werke Model ET 22.

For years, officials have been asking gun collectors and dealers to notify them if they see such a weapon or had one stolen in the early 1990s.""

789,moondog151,[],1634675942,"(This isn't what I usually post here so i'm going to explain this now. 

When it comes to UFO or paranormal cases I only share them if there is physical evidence that something indeed happened or if there are just too many witness to dismiss the case as being made up. And although I have my own opinions on UFO's, Aliens, The paranormal, Cryptids, etc,etc I'm not going to bring them up in the write up instead i'll just write what I see and read.) 

On February 23, 1975 two cousins named Yamahata and Kono were walking home from elementary school in the city of Kofu, Japan. On their way home they both saw two bright orange lights up in the sky. One of the lights the larger of the two flew towards the nearby Mt. Atago. 

The second light however started to descend allowing the boys to make out the shape of the light and realized that it was a craft of some kind. According to them the object then focused a black tube of sorts towards them. The tube started to make a sound which the boys described as sounding like a camera shutter. After this the boys started to panic and ran towards the local temple and hid behind the grave stones. They then looked up to the sky and saw the light fly away. 

Sounds simple but if the story ended here I wouldn't have made a write up. This incident was only just beginning. 

 After seeing that the light was no longer present they came out of hiding to resume their walk home. This particular area of Kofu was mainly an agricultural area which is why on their way home they ended up walking past a grape vineyard. They however noticed something strange about the vineyard, Something in it was glowing almost as if the field was on fire. The boys nervously decided to enter the field to check it out and see if it was the same object they had seen earlier. 

Once they got to the center of the field they soon laid eyes on what they called a landed flying saucer. I craft's diameter was 5 meters long (although other reports state it was 2.5) and 1 - 2 meters high, had three oval landing gears, it was now a silver stainless steel color instead of orange, It had 5 strange characters written on both sides which neither of the boys recognized, It had a tinted window near the top which wrapped around the dome, And a small stair case with seven steps that descended down to the ground.

As the boys were questioning weather to go home and have their parents come to the sight they stated that a door on the craft opened and that a silver light shined onto them. The boys then saw a humanoid figure exit the craft. According to the boys the figure was 4 ft 3 inches tall, had brown skin, was completely hairless, it's face was devoid of any eyes or a nose, It had horizontal wrinkles across it's face, It had three large white fangs coming from it's mouth, it had four fingers, pointed ears, it was wearing shiny silver clothing with something that looked like stitches around on the back and spine of the creature, had a rifle like weapon around it's shoulder and the bots were split in two were the toes of a human boot would be indicating that the creature had only two toes. 

The creature then tried to speak to the two boys with one of them saying that the sounds he was making was a ""Kyu Kyu"" sound like a tape recorder being rewinded. Yamahata terrified fell to the floor once the creature tried to speak and played dead, The creature then walked around him as if to study the boy before Kono grabbed his cousin and ran away. But while they ran away they got a small peak through the opened door and saw a little bit of the craft's inside seeing another humanoid sitting in front of some controls and a television like device however since they weren't being followed they decided to get a closer look of the inside.

The interior of the craft was rather cramped with several control panels inside of it and although you couldn't see the inside of the craft through the window you could see outside of the craft via the same window if you were inside. They didn't stay for very long however as once the humanoid turned to look at them the boys ran away and finally made their way back home. 

They both went to Kono's house and frantically tried to explain what they just saw with their parents being rather doubtful and tried to get them to calm down and eat dinner but seeing just how terrified the children the boy's mothers decided to go to the grade vineyard to either see if something was happening or to show the children that there was nothing to be afraid of.

When they arrived however the craft was still there however this time it was back to it's orginal orange color and was spinning around and flashing bright lights at 5 - 10 second intervals with one of the children's mothers comparing it to watching fireworks. Yamata's mother tried to get a closer look but the boys frantically protested and even tried holding them back from moving towards it.

Eventually the mothers relented and decided to go back home and have the boy's fathers come over to take a look themselves. However by the time they arrived it was mostly gone. The witnesses described the craft as simply shrinking smaller and smaller in size until it flew into the sky before disappearing. 

The parents explained this to their children by stating that it was likely a Japanese 人魂/Hitodama which in English translates to ""Human Souls"" but the proper nuance is ""Souls of the dead"" A Hitodama manifests it's self as balls of fire that float in the night sky. Regardless of this explanation the boys were still deeply troubled by this experience with Kono unable to sleep and Yamahata refusing to walk to school until one of his parents agreed to walk to the school with him.

At school on February 24, 1975 the two boys noticed a drawing of the craft at the corridor which surprised them greatly and after asking around found out that another boy at the school had also witnessed the UFO. The boy stated that he saw an orange light in the sky at the Kofu Bypass while in the backseat of his family's car, This sighting was 30 minutes before Yamahata and Kono's close encounter. 

The three boys told their teacher about it who dismissed the story as absurd but seeing the boys faces decided that they weren't lying and did in fact see something so she told the school's principal about this story who then contacted The Yamanashi Nichinichi Shimbun newspaper. Afterwards the teacher, principal and some journalists went to the grape vineyard to see if anything was still there. 

At the vineyard they found several strange events that support that something did indeed happen. First a concrete column in the field had completely collapsed and shattered upon hitting the ground, A steel net that was spread over the columns had been warped and distorted as if a heavy object was resting on it, Two other concrete columns were damaged, And in the area where the boys said the craft landed there were several holes in the ground, Another hole in the ground that was 50 - 60 centimetres and a white powder like substance resembling ash in the center of the hole. A professor from a high school visited the site and took toil samples from where the craft allegedly landed in order to be tested and once he tested the soil he found that they contained unnaturally high levels of radiation with other professors and experts corroborating his findings and determined that the radiation likely came from a foreign object making contact with the soil weather a UFO, Meteorite or a nuclear or radioactive substance being disposed of near the soil.

Once the newspaper published the story journalist and police interviewed others in the area and with others also coming forward and it turned out that several people also saw something in the sky that day. 

A man simply identified as Mr. A who was the manager of The Kofu City Environmental Center reported seeing a flickering yellow light in the sky, He only noticed it because his dog was barking loudly and constantly so when he went to see what was wrong he was the yellow light streak across the sky leaving a trail behind it before disappearing behind some buildings. Mr. A simply dismissed this as a shooting star at the time rather then a plane due to how fast it was flying. 

Another witness was the 59 year old high priest at the Jokoji Temple reported seeing a bright light zig-zag across the sky before shrinking in size and disappearing.

A girl of of an unknown age simply identified as D-chan witnessed a zig-zagging light from the balcony of her home.

There was another witness an insurance agent named Midori but she didn't make her sighting public until 1982. The reason she stayed silent was because she feared being ridiculed and the reason she came forward was because many people encouraged her to do so.

Midori stated that she was driving down a crossroads where she saw too small figures standing off to the side of the road. She honked her horn at them twice but they didn't move so she continued on her way but was driving slowly and as she was about to drive past them one of them approached her vehicle and it's hand on her windshield. She stated that the figure's palm was pitch black and covered in wrinkles, The wrist was also completely black and covered in wrinkles, The eyes on the figures face was also wrinkled and the eyes were straight with the eyelids being wrinkly, Unlike the sighting reported by Kono and Yamata however she reported that this figure did in fact have eyes and a nose. She soon drove off due to her shock and thus was unable to report anything else about their apperance. The differences however can be explained by how both Midori and the boys only saw the figures for brief moments in the dark combined with how it was 7 years since Midori last saw the figures.

Several theories have been considered in order to explain the incident. Several people in Japan have pointed out how the figures seem to resemble characters sometimes present in the Japanese series Ultraman with the 7th installment in the series airing it's final few episodes in 1975 with the last episode airing on March 28, 1975 and that the alleged aliens also fit many common tropes of the time period although it's possible that when drawing what they saw the boy's minds simply filled in the blanks based on stuff they already know. 

Another theory is that the boys simply witnessed a farmer spreading pesticide. Japanese farmers when spreading pesticide often wear shiny protective clothing and race coverings and when the pesticide is slung over their shoulder could look like a rifle in the dark they also wear jikatabi boots which split at the toe like the boys reported. The farmer simply may not have come forward due to all the publicity being attracted to his Grape Vineyard. 

However both of these theories fail to account for the physical evidence left at the scene such as the collapsed concrete column, the distorted net, the other two damaged concrete columns and the high radiation levels found in the soil. 

On that day the Japanese meteorological service reported that February 23, 1975 was a very calm day with there being no rain, only a week level of wind and that the sky was clear with no clouds making the stars clearly visible with Venus and Jupiter visible to the naked eye in the western sky.

The Japanese Ministry of Transport also reported that 11 planes flew over that area on that day. 

The fact that the witnesses are respectable people is also further evidence that something did indeed happen as in Japan lying about such an event would bring upon more ridicule and dishonor then it would in the west. None of them sought any attention or fame either only giving brief interviews years later and at the time of the event. 

Yamata and Kono never wavered in their story as in 1982 at 14 years old the two boys revisited the site for a TV show discussing the incident and in 2001 the two boys now 33 were separated from each other and put under hypnosis for another TV show in which they stuck to their story and the boys now in their 50s still stick to their story about witnesses aliens up close when ever interviewed. 

Also the day after the incident journalist and police questioned them separately and their stories and drawings were nearly identical. 

Despite the police and reporters swarming the vineyard and the physical damage done to the farm the owner of the grape vineyard was never interviewed and didn't give any statements. Which isn't unusual as Japanese people are usually pretty private and don't normally involve themselves in matters such like this, It's also possible that he simply didn't want to bring any more attention to his farm or this incident as he sold the grapes he farmed and if more people knew high amounts of radiation was at his farm it may harm his business. Some sources stated that he was interviewed by occult and ufo magazines but that his statement wasn't made public because he never witnessed anything. However this claim has never been verified 

That is where this case ends. Weather it's truly aliens or not is unknown but what is known is that something strange and unusual did indeed happen in that vineyard that night.

This case has been covered on this subreddit before, but being somewhat local to the case and seeing some recent shocking news related to it, I wanted to re-share it. The unsettling and shocking news is that the victim's parents have given the money ($60,000+) that was donated and meant to help solve the case to a local rotary club. The news about the parents donating the money doesn't sit right with me because at the crime scene, an earring thought to be from the murderer was recovered. This earing had DNA evidence on it, so in theory this is a case that could 'easily' be solved with genetic genealogy.  Note- the earring has been tested for DNA matches before. When I read the article from the first link below, I couldn't help but wonder how the parents, in this day and age, could accept that the murder will never be solved.  In addition, if they know a crazed lunatic capable of murdering two fit, grown men is out there, why on Earth would they be ok with him/her roaming the streets?

To summarize this case, it was a brutal double murder of two 20-year-old men back in 1993, Bryan Benson and Seann Campbell. They were working as clerks at West Coast Video (a video rental chain similar to Blockbuster but with an ‘adult’ section) in Warminster, Pennsylvania when they were both attacked and stabbed to death with a knife that was never recovered. They both had defensive wounds. Money was missing from the cash register, but both men had cash on their person. The police discovered a wire to the store’s security camera had been cut. It wasn't until the next morning that their bodies were discovered by the store owner.  Why didn’t any of the parents check the store when they failed to return home from their shifts?  

Was this a random attack? Robbery gone wrong? Planned murder staged to look like a robbery? Was only one of them the target? Were they in a relationship together?  By all accounts, these men were law abiding citizens and they were free of problematic relationships.

Highlight from this article:

""Four months after the murder, then-Bucks County DA Alan Rubenstein, now a Common Pleas Court judge, announced a DNA sample had been obtained from what police and prosecutors still believe is the most promising piece of evidence -- a half-inch fake diamond stud earring. The earring, which had **fresh tissue and blood on it**, was found on the floor between the dead men. Police believe it may have been yanked out of an attacker’s ear during the struggle. No DNA match has ever been made.""

**Where the case stands today.** The Sheriff believed that the suspect was outside of the community, though many citizens believed it had to be someone local given where her body was left. Because she was only 5 at the time, Sheryl's description of the man is limited, though he may have been wearing glasses. [In fact, a quote attributed to the Sheriff at the time: *""We only know two things for sure ... it was a man and he drove an automobile.""*](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/83983707/the-delphos-courant/) still stands to this day. 

Did Nancy know who her killer was? Was the killer from outside the Pauling, Ohio community? Was this the killer's first or last murder? 

With this case remaining unsolved since 1960, Nancy Eagleson's family is still searching for answers in her murder from more than 60 years ago. This case is extensive with more than 300 public media sources. If you know something about this crime, please call the Paulding County Sheriff’s office at 419-399-3791.

Anthropologists believe they have found human remains in an SUV that was submerged in the Ohio River for nearly 20 years before it was discovered last week, the Indiana State Police announced Tuesday. The 1997 Nissan Pathfinder is at the center of a missing person investigation for a mother and her two children that began in 2002.

Anthropologists with the University of Indianapolis and Indiana State Police Investigators searched the vehicle and found remains that they believe to be a human bone, state police said in a statement. The bone will now be sent to a lab for testing to confirm its origin. 
The Delhi Township Police Department began investigating the disappearance of 26-year-old Stephanie Van Nguyen and her two young children — 3-year-old John and 4-year-old Kristina — in April 2002, police said. 


Police said the information gathered at the time ""indicated that Nguyen left a note that she was going to drive into the Ohio River."" But the vehicle was never located — until police started looking into the case again in 2021. 

After searching the river with sonar technology, authorities said last week that they found the Pathfinder near Aurora, Indiana, approximately 50 feet deep and 300 feet from the bank of the river. The vehicle's registration plate confirmed it belonged to Nguyen.

793,FormicaCats,[],1634661711,"I was just reading the post from a few days ago on Ellen Greenberg. I think people repeated some inaccurate information and made it seem much simpler than it is. This is the most in-depth article on the case and where I am taking most of the following information: [https://www.inquirer.com/crime/a/ellen-greenberg-death-suicide-homicide-philadelphia-mystery-20190316.html](https://www.inquirer.com/crime/a/ellen-greenberg-death-suicide-homicide-philadelphia-mystery-20190316.html). It provides links to some of the case documents.

 * There were no disturbances and no blood anywhere else besides the kitchen. She had no defensive wounds from the knife, and no one else left blood at the scene. That could mean it was a very fast attack, as one investigator says in the article, or it could mean there was no one to struggle against. Unusual and hard to explain whether homicide or suicide. 

* There weren't wounds to her back - there were wounds to the back of her neck, chest, stomach, and one """"gash"" to her scalp. My impression from comments was that she had stab wounds to her actual back and to the back of her head which of course seems hard to do logistically, but that's not where her injuries were. There were also bruises on the right side of her body. 

* Four of the wounds were deep: on her stomach, two to the back of her neck, and one to her chest. The others included wounds described as ""nicks"" and other described as shallow punctures. Some of these could be hesitation wounds, which would be strange in the kind of ""blitz"" attack that would explain the lack of a struggle. However the four deep wounds argue against suicide as would the fact that the wounds were inflicted through her clothes. The wounds are unusual for suicide AND unusual for homicide.

 * Examiners looking at her possible spinal cord injury have come to difference conclusions. Both of the examiners are highly qualified experts. The first said that the spinal cord sheath was damaged, but not cut through. They thought that the damage could have caused her to become numb (meaning she might not have felt the other wounds) but not make it impossible for her to continue. The second pathologist to examine this issue looked at a preserved piece of spinal cord and found that her cranial cavity (not sure if that is distinct in some way from the skull) had been penetrated and her spinal cord had been severed. After the final stab wound, the knife was left in her chest so if this second examination is correct someone else had to do that. 

 * This second examiner also found that there was no bleeding from the wound seen in the spinal cord. This examiner said this is a significant finding and in answer to a question ""Yeah, I mean in general, no hemorrhage means no pulse."" That's why the family's lawyer went to the press a few days ago to say that Ellen was already dead when some of the wounds were inflicted. But there's that ""in general"" qualifier.  

 * She was experiencing more serious mental health problems than some people acknowledge: 
- Her best friend and family reported a big change in her demeanor. 
- She had asked her parents about moving back home.
- There were suicide-related searches on her computer - an article about suicide methods, ""quick suicide,"" ""quick death,"" an article about painless suicide. (The police report says that there was nothing on her computer about suicide, but this is incorrect - they said later that they might not have had the information at the time they wrote the report.) 
- A text conversation with her mom suggests to me that she was feeling worse the day before she died (her mom said you need to see a professional""). 
- The recent meta post on myths around suicide eliminates a LOT of the arguments people make about why this had to have been murder: most people don't leave notes, people don't follow rules about methods, and it's often impulsive (someone can make plans for the future one hour and then feel suicidal the next). They do it in ways and at times that make no sense to a healthy person.
 - She wasn't on anti-depressants but she was researching them, researching depression itself, and had started and stopped Zoloft. Her psychiatrist described her anxiety as ""severe.""

 * Two of the reports that say homicide are by experts that I find suspect: a JFK conspiracy theorist who did not have the police files and the forensic expert for the O.J. Simpson DEFENSE team. The other various experts are more cautious about their findings, whether they ultimately settle on homicide or suicide. The state has had experts come to both conclusions, so it isn't like they're hiding the fact that there are inconsistencies. I don't think any expert who says there's an obvious answer is being completely upfront. 

 * Two investigators describe blood flowing the wrong way in one of the photos: from her nose to her ear as though she was looking up, when she was found with her head upright. That could mean her body was moved.

* I saw people repeating that her fiance ""refused"" to do CPR. The police report says that he was instructed to stop CPR by the 911 operator. His key fob supported his story (I think that means that it was used to enter the gym at the time he said he went to the gym but I'm not sure). His story: he went to the gym in their building for about half an hour and was locked out when he came back. He texted her a bunch of very annoyed messages. He asked for help from the security guard, who refused, and then forced the door open himself and called 911. Some people stated that he called his family and a lawyer first before calling 911 - I don't know the source for that, no one mentions that in the article. As has been discussed, the door was locked but that doesn't prove anything because people can lock those from the outside. If he had done something to her he was able to clean up without leaving a trace in the apartment or elsewhere in the building He did it quickly, since the police report suggests she hadn't been gone that long before they arrived.

So I have no opinions actually on what happened, but hope it's helpful for others to see how much conflicting evidence there is. It's not really the police immediately assuming someone committed suicide ""just because"" she saw a psychiatrist or took anti-anxiety medication. ""Twenty stab wounds"" of which many are to the back would obviously be a murder; what we have instead are four real stab wounds and lots of things more accurately described as nicks and cuts, all in places that a person could easily reach.",Ellen Greenberg - it's not that simple!

794,janiceian1983,[],1634654877,"Montréal, Québec, Canada, 1982.

\----- August 8th -----

Diane Bélanger, 19, had just left her parents' house and was temporarily living at her boyfriend's cousin's place until the apartment she wanted to move in became available. The apartment was located at 2269 Dorion street in the Sainte-Marie neighbourhood of Montreal, east of the Gay Village.

As compensation for staying there a few days, Diane had offered to babysit the couple's child, which is exactly what she was doing on the night between August 7 and 8 in 1982.

Around 3 am on August 8, her boyfriend's cousin and her spouse came back from their night out and they shared some take-out pizza they had brought back with her and chatted for a bit before going to bed. During the conversation, Diane made a passing comment that she had a lingering feeling that a man had followed her down the street the previous day until she reached the apartment.

The next morning, the couple woke up and were shocked to find that Diane was nowhere to be found. The storm door's screen had been torn through, Diane's purse was on the floor with all of its contents strewn around the room and her night gown had been thrown in the bath tub. A kitchen knife was also missing. But otherwise, there weren't traces of a fight inside the apartment.

(Important detail, a lot of people living in Triplex buildings on the Plateau and Sainte-Marie who didn't have AC would leave their front door open with only the storm door closed to let air inside during the summer back in those days.)

\----- The ""other Diane"" -----

Meanwhile, down the street, another woman named Diane Bélanger was quite fearful for her life.

A couple of days after the first Diane Bélanger had vanished in the middle of the night, THIS Diane was recuperating in the hospital after a severe beating and was met by the then Chief investigor of the Montreal Police, Jean-Claude Rochon.

This Diane told something very shocking to the investigator. Not only did she live near the disappeared Diane, but she also shared her date of birth. She was a drug addict and prostitute and said that someone in her ""network"" wished her dead. The reason why someone might want her dead was never revealed. She personally believed that whatever had happened to Diane was a result of mistaken identity. She was certain that she was the intended target and that the other Diane might have mistakenly gotten murdered in her stead. She told the investigators that they should look around the region of Chertsey, QC for her body, but searches in that area produced no results.

\----- Since then -----

Ever since that night of August 1982, investigators have tried to keep the case open. Holes were dug around the building where she was last seen on the theory that she might have been murdered in the house by the occupants and then burried on the property but nothing was found there either.

The chief investigator would often come down to the morgue when unindentified bodies were recovered in case it turned out to be Diane, but nothing turned up in the last 39 years.

Diane's mother and sister have repeatedly denied the theory that Diane might have snapped and decided to leave everything behind that night because they considered that Diane was happy with her life and had no reason to suddenly just disappear like that. They also bring up the comment that Diane had made earlier that night about having been followed home on the previous day.

What is most puzzling about this case is how a 19 year old was abducted from the inside of an apartment in the middle of the night in a triplex building on the second floor and yet NOBODY (including 3 people inside the same apartment) heard any screams or struggle noises and the abductor somehow managed to drag her down an exterior spiral staircase without anybody at 2269 or neighbouring units realizing that somebody was getting abducted.

Also, the police believed that the screen on the storm door looked like it had been torn through from the inside but I personally don't really see how they could come to that conclusion as we're not talking about glass but a mesh material.

795,SomeKindofPurgatory,[],1634605943,"I'm kinda surprised there aren't more people talking about this given all the resurgent hoopla surrounding UFOs (including the [recent report](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf) from the military claiming that they still don't know what the vast majority of them were.)

I think there is a simple (but interesting!) explanation for a *lot* of UFO sightings. Not all, but quite a lot. And, funnily enough, the *general* principle behind it will be very familiar to many cat owners.

And it was all researched and explained by Tom Mahood. This is the same guy who [found the remains of the missing Death Valley Germans](https://www.otherhand.org/home-page/search-and-rescue/the-hunt-for-the-death-valley-germans/), found the crash site of a [secret CIA-owned Blackbird](https://www.otherhand.org/home-page/area-51-and-other-strange-places/bluefire-main/bluefire/the-hunt-for-928/) (incidentally, this is the same model plane that Elon Musk named his kid after), and spent so much time [trying to find Bill Ewasko](https://www.otherhand.org/home-page/search-and-rescue/searching-for-bill-ewasko/) after he disappeared in Joshua Tree National Park.

(Warning: many long-read rabbit holes.)

Tom also did a *lot* of research into Area 51 / UFO stuff.  He paid particular attention on Bob Lazar, who was big name back in the 1980s UFO scene... and decades later he's STILL a big name. (Joe Rogan had him on his podcast just a couple years back.) 

It seems pretty clear to me that Lazar is a crank and a serial liar looking to make money for himself, so why is he still so popular? Well... first off, millions of people still really do *want* to believe (just like that old X-Files poster) in aliens. And it's true that Lazar did do *some* work at some classified government bases around Area 51. And apparently one night back in the 80s he led a group of acquaintances out there to view luminous flying saucers, which did the usual impossible flying saucer tricks of moving around the sky in a fast, smooth and abrupt manner that would be impossible with known human technology.  

From my understanding, this same kind of ""impossible acceleration"" behavior was present in recent UFO reports, including the ""tic tac"". 

How could these UFOs accelerate and stop so effortlessly with our current technology? How is it possible to achieve those reported speeds? Well, again, many you cat lovers out there will be pretty familiar with the general concept.

Ok, I'll stop being coy: it's basically akin to a laser pointer... but it's a *three dimensional* laser pointer. (I don't think Tom describes it with this analogy, but I think it fits.)

Not a literal laser, but instead a high powered proton beam. (Technically it could be any ion beam, but protons--i.e. ionized hydrogen--is by far the lightest element and therefore has the longest range for a given power output.) 

Basically, if you shoot a high powered ion beam into the air, it travels for a certain distance without interacting very much with the surrounding matter, and then--when its power level drops below a certain critical threshold--it dumps all of its energy into the surrounding area, all at once.

This is why proton beams are used as a treatment for cancer--the beam can be calibrated to go X inches into your body and then dump its energy precisely where the tumor is.

But they can be scaled up to much higher powers.  According to Tom's research (worth noting here that he has a masters degree in physics, and he also specifically sought out some experts in this area), the ultimate result of firing a high powered proton beam into the air... would be a huge glowing spheroid (oblong from certain angles, more circular from others) of plasma. 

And they could move that glowing spheroid around just like you can move the red dot from a laser pointer.. except that they can also adjust the ""depth"" (distance from the emitter) by varying the power output.  

And so just can you make the dot from a laser pointer fly around with very little effort, you can easily make such a ball of plasma appear to accelerate and dance around in ways that a physical aircraft could never do, simply by rotating the emitter and varying the power output.

Next question: Why would the US government want such a ""3D laser pointer""? And why keep it secret?

Well, hard data on this is tricky to come by, but Tom believes that the resulting ball of plasma **would likely reflect radar waves**. This is not only an incredibly useful defensive ability--basically acting as chaff to distract radar-guided missiles--but the military might also use such beams to trick an adversary into thinking there are a fleet of planes in an area many miles away from where the real planes actually are. 

(I think Tom also says something about believing that the device might also technically violate some treaties that the USA has signed, but even if this isn't true those are obviously some very compelling reasons for keeping such a project secret.)

Presumably, the shape of the plasma ball could be altered by firing multiple converging beams from slightly different angles (also presumably local air conditions would affect its shape.)

And here's a bit of speculation that's entirely my own: what would  the plasma ball from a high powered proton beam look like under full daylight? Maybe the colorful fireball would be mostly washed out by the sunlight... but at the same time, perhaps the air would still be energized enough to generate a shimmering mirage (like the stuff you'll often see on black asphalt on a very hot day). Under the right conditions, it might look kinda shiny. *Maybe* it would even look... metallic.  If true, that could explain even more UFO sightings. (Again, this point is pure and uneducated speculation on my part; Tom didn't mention that as a possibility.)

And these beams can be pretty long range, if you have enough power. I'm not certain if an aircraft would be able to realistically generate that much power, but a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier or submarine might. 

So... it's obvious why our military would want such a device and it's obvious why they'd keep it a secret, but if that were case... why would our own military release all of this UFO report stuff? 

Well, I personally think there are two possible answers here:

1. This is simply a case of our right hand not knowing what our left hand is up to. Our government investigating itself isn't a new thing at all.  For example, the CIA once did an investigation of the [NRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office) and claimed they were secretly hoarding [billions of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office#Funding_controversy) for off-the-books projects.

2. This is just a weird way of baiting the UFO community into generating more hysteria/nonsense/faked UFO videos, thus drawing some attention away from reports and videos of our secret proton beam being tested.  (This sounds a bit nuts, but Tom's analysis of what appeared to happened with Bob Lazar back in the 80s kinda implies that this *might* be exactly what happened... Lazar showed a bunch of friends these plasma balls created by this highly secret radar spoofing device and talks a lot of crap about how they were actually alien spacecraft... so, given so many witnesses, in an attempt to keep secret what they were actually up to the government may have tacitly encouraged Lazar and the UFO craze that kept on growing throughout the 90s.)

Also pretty interesting: The last link below illustrates the possibility of proton beam being scaled up into absurd ""death ray"" territory. Such a device would definitely have to be stationary, very large and probably obscenely expensive, but in principle an ultra high powered beam might be usable as a directed energy weapon with a range of dozens of miles. Strong enough to stop a military jet? Hell... strong enough to destroy an incoming nuclear ICBM, or at least make it malfunction? I mean, who knows. That's some crazy Tesla-type stuff right there, but with enough power and an enormous tank of hydrogen and a big enough emitter...

Anyway, here's some links. Tom Mahood has written a bunch of different stuff on multiple sites (dating all the way back to the 90s), so I might be missing some of it, but here's what I can easily find:

MARION, Ohio — The Marion County Sheriff’s Office is crediting developments in DNA technology for helping investigators identify the victim of an Ohio cold case dating back to more than 30 years. 

In July 1989, the body of a man was found in Flat Run Creek in Marion County. Despite its efforts, the Marion County Sheriff’s office was unable to identify the man and the case went cold. 

In a renewed effort to solve the case, the sheriff’s office contacted the DNA Doe Project, which uses genetic genealogy to help with the identification process in homicide investigations.  

With help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, authorities identified the victim as John Kraicinsky. 

“We have several other cold cases that we will continue to work to obtain justice for victims and closure for families,” Sheriff Matt Bayles said in a release.

According to the sheriff’s office, Kraicinsky was last in contact with his family the month his body was found. Family members told authorities they never reported him missing because they believed Kraicinsky “may have just moved away to start another life.”  
Sheriff Bayles plans to hold a briefing at 9 a.m. Tuesday to discuss the findings of the case.

797,spookycherrypie,[],1634582678,"On September 17, 2016 the skeletal remains of a small child were found in a pasture just off of Interstate 45 in Madisonville, Texas. [View an artistic rendering here.](https://imgur.com/a/QeJ9M0h) The remains were found inside three garbage bags that had been placed inside a zippered suitcase. It is suspected the child had been deceased between 3 and 5 months. She is believed to be a Native American, Caucasian or Hispanic female between 2 and 6 years of age. She had long, thick, dark hair that came to just past her shoulders. She was found wearing a [pink dress (size 4T' ""Mon Petit"" brand) with embroidered butterflies and the words ""Follow Your Dreams""](https://imgur.com/a/tptnFyf) and a size 4 diaper (""Parent's Choice"" brand). Sources do not disclose her cause of death and since her remains were nearly completely or completely skeletonized, it may not be known.

The little girl's remains suggested she had micrognathia, a condition causing a lower jaw that is smaller than normal**,** which may have affected her ability to eat on her own. She was found with a feeding tube and would have required medical care during her life. The lower jaw would have been smaller than the rest of her face, causing a receded chin and was most likely unable to close her mouth. The skull was deformed and flattened on one side. The girl's head and face would have been asymmetrical. The left side of her face would have been more prominent.

Did she pass away in an accident caused by neglect or abuse from her caregivers? Or the worst scenario- did they intentionally cause her death? A silver child's bedspread and small green blanket were found near her, it's unclear in sources if they were in the suitcase with her or not but it's possible these contain evidence of how she passed. 

A desert digital pattern military-issued camo shirt and adult grey sweatshirt were nearby, possibly also discarded due to containing blood or other evidence. 

Pollen analysis has suggested that the child may have been from or spent time in the southwest United States, specifically Southeast Arizona, or in the adjacent areas of Mexico.

A sad case all around with not a ton of info. Hopefully someone will recognize this little girl someday.

798,Personal-Proposal-91,[],1634576864,"I think we've all heard of the 1962 escape from Alcatraz, where Frank Morris, John and Clarence Anglin disappeared without a trace. And how could we not? It's a classic tale that we all hope to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

But were they the only ones to escape from Alcatraz without a trace? 

&amp;#x200B;

Not quite.

&amp;#x200B;

Theodore Cole and Ralph Roe were both serial bank robbers with a knack for escaping, which led them to the infamous Rock in 1935. After 2 years inside, they decided that they wanted out. Roe was waiting on a Death Penalty whereas Cole was doing serious time.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1937, the two decided to hatch a plan to escape. They began cutting the bars of a window in the mat shop of the prison. After days of cutting and disguising the cuts with nail polish and grease, they decided to make their escape.

&amp;#x200B;

On December 16, 1937, the two inmates smashed the glass of the window with a wrench and made their way to the gate with tires or fuel canisters. They broke the gate and made their way to the water, never to be seen again.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, is that truly the case?

&amp;#x200B;

Many sightings occurred after the escape, such as two hitchhikers identifying them, and a San Francisco reporter claiming that they lived in South America in 1941. In 1939, it is rumoured that they went on hijacking sprees with the authorities' knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

But the chances of escaping were extremely thin. By winter, the temperature of the water would've been deathly low, between 46 and 58 degrees. The authorities concluded that not even an expert swimmer could've made it out alive.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? Did they die, or were they the first to successfully challenge the security of Alcatraz?

800,QuinnZaneAuthor,[],1634516701,"Thursday night was theirs — a time when they could be alone together despite living so far apart, despite living in such an unwelcoming world — every Thursday night, they were able to live as they wanted. Cathy Thomas would drive up from Virginia Beach to visit her girlfriend, Becky Dowski, at the College of William and Mary on Thursday nights.

It was 1986. Ronald Reagan was in office, unions were being crushed, HIV/AIDS was decimating the gay population and the government didn’t care, our hair was as big as our homeless population, and our anti-Russia sentiment was even bigger. At the time, a young graduate of the United States Naval Academy who was fluent in Russian would be assumed to have a glowing career of patriotic service ahead of **him** — but the same would not be true for a graduate of the Naval Academy whose name was Cathy.

Cathleen Thomas was born on July 29, 1959, to an Irish Catholic family in Massachusetts. Her father was a graduate of the Naval Academy and Cathy and her brother both followed in his footsteps — becoming the first father-son-daughter team to graduate from the Academy when Cathy graduated as an Ensign in 1981. After graduation from the Naval Academy, sailors are required to perform five years of active duty, which Cathy did in Norfolk, Virginia. She served as a Logistics Officer on the L.Y. Spear, in charge of the movement of cranes and torpedoes.

Cathleen Thomas was one of the first female sailors to become Surface Warfare qualified.

If Cathleen Thomas had been heterosexual or male or (luck of the gods!) both, she would be alive today and this article would be about her stellar military career, or her talent at the art of diplomacy, or even about a senator who was a former naval officer now running for the highest office in the land. But Cathy was gay so this article is about her murder instead of the gifts that she would have offered to her nation.

The murder of Cathleen Thomas was identified as the first in a string of murders known as the Colonial Parkway Murders but Cathy’s brother (Bill Thomas) and other investigators now believe that her murder was a hate crime connected to other anti-gay hate crimes in the area — but unconnected to the string of murders committed on the Colonial Parkway in the late 1980s.

Is it possible? Could there have been two serial killers at large in the same small area at the same time?

On October 12, 1986, a jogger found Cathy Thomas’s white Honda Civic pushed down an embankment just off of the Colonial Parkway and called the police. National Park Service Rangers arrived to investigate what they believed to be a car accident and smashed out the back window of the Honda Civic to reach the two supposed accident victims inside. In the hatchback of the car was the body of Cathy Thomas and in the backseat was the body of her girlfriend, Rebecca Dowski. Both women had rope burns on their necks and wrists and both women’s throats had been slit.

The murderer had poured diesel fuel inside the car and attempted to set it on fire with a lit cigarette but the flashpoint of diesel is too high to ignite, so he gave up and pushed the car down the embankment to hide it from the clear view of the road. Both women’s wallets containing cash were found inside of the vehicle and the glove box was open. There was no evidence of sexual assault. There was an important difference in the way the killer had treated the two women though.

“Becky’s wound isn’t as deep as Cathy’s wound They’re very very different in force and intensity. Becky was collateral damage” \~Dr. Laura Pettler, Forensic Criminologist

Because of the perpetrator's clear focus of violence against Cathy, initial investigators assumed that Cathy had known her murderer and their primary suspect was her ex-girlfriend, Jolene. Jolene and Cathy had dated seriously but had broken up amicably and Jolene had even introduced Cathy to her new girlfriend, Rebecca. Jolene and Rebecca were in a computer class together at the College of William and Mary and had become quick friends — close enough for Jolene to introduce Rebecca to her ex and wish the happy couple well. This scenario is easily recognizable to anyone in the lesbian community (or anyone who’s watched the L Word) and yet investigators at the time were determined to paint the murder of Cathy and Rebecca as the act of a jealous ex-lover.

“What the FBI knew about the gay community could fill a thimble” \~Bill Thomas, brother of Cathy Thomas

The FBI pursued the wrong suspect by pursuing Cathy Thomas’ ex-girlfriend and also based their investigation on a seriously flawed timeline. They believed that Cathy Thomas and Rebecca Dowski were killed on the evening of October l0, 1986 but all of the evidence pointed to the two women dying on the night before, October 9, 1986.

Cathy did not show up for work on Friday, October 10, 1986, and Rebecca did not show up for her classes on that day. Also, Cathy and Rebecca always met up on Thursday nights and drove to the same secluded spot on the Colonial Parkway together — the spot where Cathy’s car was found. In order to fit the FBI’s theory of events, the women would’ve had to meet up on a Friday instead of their usual Thursday night rendezvous and would’ve had to both be no-shows at their jobs and schools on Friday for no reason.

The timeline matters. Suspects who had an alibi for Friday night may have been falsely excluded when Cathy and Rebecca had already been dead for 24 hours.

Cathy Thomas died clutching a handful of her killer's hair — this and the butts from the cigarettes the perpetrator had thrown into the car in an attempt to light it on fire could both be important sources of DNA and help in one day bringing the killer to justice.

On September 20, 1987, David Knobling and Robin Edwards were shot to death in Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge on the south shore of the James River near Smithfield, Virginia. David was 20 and Robin was 14. They were both last seen alive on September 19, 1987. Knobling’s black Ford pickup truck was found abandoned in the Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge parking lot on September 21, 1987, and two days later, Knobling’s own father found David and Robin’s bodies washed ashore in a sandy cove of the James River. Robin was shot in the back of her head and David was shot twice, once in his upper left shoulder and once in the back of his head. There were no wallets found at the scene and David had only fourteen cents in his pocket — a clear sign that robbery may have been a motive for this slaying.

Keith Call and Cassandra Hailey both disappeared on April 10, 1988. Keith was 20 and Cassandra was 18 years old. On April 11, 1988, a National Park Service Ranger found Call’s red 1982 Toyota Celica abandoned on the Colonial Parkway. The front door was ajar, the glove box was open, and the driver’s seat was pushed far forward — too far for the five-foot-ten-inch tall Keith to have been that seats last occupant. The driver’s side of the backseat was full of debris (newspapers and other garbage) but the passenger’s side of the backseat and floor was clear — as if someone had been sitting there. The bodies of Keith Call and Cassandra Hailey have never been found.

Daniel Lauer and Annamaria Phelps were last seen near the I-64 rest stop in New Kent County on September 5, 1989. Law enforcement found Daniel’s 1973 Chevrolet Nova at the rest stop with the keys still in the ignition and Annamaria’s purse still in the vehicle. Six weeks later, two hunters found the bodies of Daniel Lauer and Annamaria Phelps off of a logging road that was one mile from the rest stop where their car was found. Their remains were skeletonized and some of their bones had been scattered by wildlife in the area. The extent of decomposition made it hard to determine Daniel and Annamaria’s cause of death, so their remains were eventually sent to the Smithsonian Institute. Daniel’s cause of death remained undetermined but the Smithsonian was able to find marks on Annamaria’s bones indicative of stabbing.

The Colonial Parkway Murders have been viewed as the work of a serial killer by many investigators. The murders of all four couples occurred within a 30-mile radius, at night, on weekends or holidays, in areas that resemble lover’s lanes, in cars, and in all instances, there were two victims.

“To me, this is the work of a serial killer. I see the killer evolving, not just in his methods but in his motives.” \~ Maureen O’Connell, Former FBI Special Agent

All due respect to a highly trained FBI Agent who knows more about these things than I (a self-educated true-crime writer) do — but I don’t see it. And some professionals don’t see this as the work of a serial killer either.

“Law enforcement (and) journalists have come to the conclusion that all four were done by a serial killer. But to me, there (are) obvious differences. There’s no fingerprints in common. There’s no DNA in common. There’s no weapon in common. As a prosecutor, I couldn’t put that in front of a jury.” \~Loni Coombs, former Prosecutor for Los Angeles County

Some of the victims were robbed, some were not. Some bodies were left in the cars of the victims, some were left outside, and some were never found. Some of the victims were shot, some were stabbed, and some had their throats slit. Three of the pairs of victims were heterosexual and one of the pairs was a lesbian couple.

Almost seven years after the “last” Colonial Parkway Murder, on June 1, 1996, National Park Service Rangers found the bodies of Lollie Winans and Julie Williams at a Shenandoah National Park campsite almost 200 miles west of the Colonial Parkway. Lollie and Julie were a lesbian couple who had left their home in Vermont thirteen days earlier to hike the Appalachian Trail. The murderer bound both women and slit their throats — almost exactly replicating the murders of Cathy Thomas and Rebecca Dowski ten years earlier. Cathy’s own brother, Bill Thomas, believes that the murders of Lollie Winans and Julie Williams are “substantially similar” to the murders of his sister and Rebecca Dowski.

“Lesbian couples, isolated, rural areas, knives used, throats slashed, two extremely athletic women but limited sign of struggle.” \~ Bill Thomas, brother of Cathy Thomas.

Despite all of her talents, Cathy Thomas had left the Navy in the year before her murder. She had been subjected to the “special” treatment reserved for women in the early days of the integration of women into the service and, as an officer, it can be assumed that there were quite a few enlisted men who did not take kindly to taking orders from a female superior. On top of all of this, Cathy was gay during a time when that was an inarguable reason to be kicked out of the military. When Cathy was murdered, forensic experts have said that she was the primary target and her girlfriend was “collateral damage”. Because of this, I believe it is highly possible that Cathy was targeted by a man who had served under her and resented her deeply — perhaps a man who had subsequently left the Navy and gone to work for the park service. The murders of Cathy Thomas and Rebecca Dowski may have been the first killings of an anti-gay serial killer who then went on to murder Lollie Winans and Julie Williams in Shenandoah National Park — and perhaps other women in national parks. The murders of David Knobling, Robin Edwards, Keith Call, Cassandra Hailey, Daniel Lauer, and Annamaria Phelps may be the work of a separate serial killer with different motivations.

All of these murders are unsolved many decades later and it is critical for there to be new thinking and a new approach to these cases.

Cathy Thomas was trying to be an American hero and some hateful little man decided it was his role to put her in her place. It is time for all of us to help make sure that her murderer ends up in the place he belongs — jail.

If you have any information on the murders of Cathleen Thomas, Rebecca Dowski, or any other Colonial Parkway victims, please call the Norfolk, VA FBI Field Office at (757) 455–0100.

Bill Thomas, the brother of Cathy Thomas, has set up a Facebook group to help solve his sister’s murder and bring her killer to justice and also hosts a podcast with Kristin Dilley [https://mindovermurderpodcast.com/](https://mindovermurderpodcast.com/) .

803,Arseofthepig,[],1634490254,"First of, mods, feel free to delete this post but I feel we need to have a frank discussion about suicide and the myths that many folks on this sub seem to believe. I've been reading the comments on a recent post, and the misinformation about suicide was wild.

1. PEOPLE WHO ARE SUICIDAL DO MAKE PLANS.

Seriously, if I see one more person comment something along the lines of ""suicidal people don't typically make plans"", I'll probably end up prematurely bald.

Suicidal people do in fact make plans. Using myself as an example, you know what I did when I knew I was gonna kill myself in a week's time? I made plans. I made plans with friends and family. It kept up the illusion that I was okay. They couldn't stop me if they thought I was fine. 

My best friend had made plans to attend a big group gathering of friends two days bed re jumping in front of a train. I have spoken to people who have lost family members on the day of very special occasions such as people who lost a parent as said parent was making their way to a family wedding.

Unfortunately, it happens. Please don't think someone was not a suicide because ""they had plans"". So did thousands of others who are no longer here.

2. PEOPLE WHO ARE SUICIDAL CAN HAVE A LOVING AND SUPPORTIVE NETWORK

Another common theme I see when suicide is discuss is ""it couldn't possibly be a suicide because they had such a loving family/supportive friends,"" or ""they would never leave their child/mum/dad/dog/spouse/chinchilla.""

But here's the thing, which for some is hard to grip, there's lots of reasons why someone who is feeling suicidal might leave the people they love. They may feel like their family and friends would be better off without them, and believe me, no matter how much you try to convince a person like this otherwise, it makes no different. I've experienced this from both sides. A suicidal person may not even believe that their friends and family care. The mind is not in a rational place for most suicidal people, so even if someone is clearly loved, that might not be how their brain is seeing it. If no-one loves you, what's the point of staying, right?

That's just two of many reasons. Many people will g w their own experiences to add.

3. SUICIDAL PEOPLE CAN CARRY ON LIKE NOTHING IS WRONG

I don't know why some people seem to believe that suicidal people just lay in bed all day, crying and planning to die whilst writing an intricate suicide note lamenting all their problems. Sure, that may be the case for some, but most are able to carry on relatively normal. They put on a mask. They pretend that everything is okay. Of the people I know who have committed suicide, most of them where the happiest go lucky people that I ever knew, expect for the moments they were honest and told me how they were really feeling.

4. MOST SUICIDAL PEOPLE DO NOT LEAVE A NOTE

If I remember correctly, the number of victims who actually leave notes is somewhere around the 20% mark. No note doesn't mean no suicide.

4. MANY SUICIDES ARE SPUR OF THE MOMENT/UNPLANNED

""Little Timmy was on his way home from work, so it couldn't possibly be suicide as he was about to see his loving family and his dog, Granola""... 

Little Timmy 100% could have decided to drive to a bridge and end it all, because little Timmy did exactly what a co-worker of mine did when their shift ended several years ago. It unfortunately happens. My co-worker had had an argument with his father, went to work and then after work drove 15 minutes to a large bridge over a river. CCTV caught the whole thing. That's all it takes sometimes, unfortunately.

5. STOP TRYING TO ARGUE AGAINST SUICIDE BECAUSE OF YOUR PERSONAL THOUGH PROCESSES/LOGIC/REASONING

Funny enough, many people are not in a rational frame of mind when they make the decision to kill themself. Sure the thought process may not make sense to you, but it 100% did to the person who killed themself at the time.

The world is a tough place for many. It tears many apart and they can't cope. Sometimes it looks like something small and insignificant pushed them over the edge. But potentially the small thing was the straw that broke the camel's back. Or, the small thing that seemed inconsequential to you is a big deal to them.

To show you how irrational a suicidal mind can be, here's some reasons why I considered suicide in the past beyond just being depressed:

Homework was hard
Arguement with father
Couldn't be bothered to live anymore
Work was boring
I was convinced people didn't like me 

The list goes on. Small things that are easy enough to overcome for anyone of rational thought, but when you're mind I'd being irrational, death can seem like the only option.


I hastily add that I've had a whole load of therapy and medication since then so I don't want to kill myself at every minor inconvenience.

6. SUICIDE IS NOT A SELFISH ACT.

We're never going to make any progress against the stigma of mental health if we keep trying to tell suicidal people that they're just being selfish. 

Imagine you're in extraordinary pain and you want it all to end. Then you have people telling you that you're selfish for wanting the pain to stop. That you should think about them and how much it would hurt them if you made the pain stop. Does that help? Do you feel better now? No,.of course you don't!

Suicide is a drastic solution to the problems of the world, so maybe instead of trying to guilt people, we should try to help them. Hell, some people are just depressed because their brains aren't making the required chemicals. It's unfair to vilify these people when it's their own bodies betrays them.

7. SUICIDE ISN'T AS EASY AS SOME OF YOU SEEM TO THINK

""They shot themself in the head twice! It's obviously murder.""

Here's a thought, there have been numerous cases of people who have tried to shot themself in the head, only to flinch as they pull the trigger, causing themself to fire a non-lethal shot. So they fire again, this time fatally. Look at that, two shots for one death. It happens.

Of course if the police are claiming that someone shot themselves in the head 26 times with a long rifle, by all means be suspicious, but two shots to the head is not suspicious in and of its own.

Same with standing hangings. It's easier to hang yourself by just leaning forward than it is to find a high place to hang yourself from.

Oh, and overdoses are 1) excruciatingly painful (0/10,.do not recommend), and often unsuccessful.

8. SPREADING MISINFORMATION ABOUT SUICIDE IS HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS

So stop it! Educate yourself! I know I don't know everything, so I try to listen to others, to learn from their experiences. Pushing myths about suicide is flipping reckless, and could end up endangering somebody. So before you start with the ""suicidal people don't make plans."" ask yourself if that is really true. 

Sorry for the rant, but having lost close friends to suicide, the misinformation drives me mad. As a true crime sub, we should be some of the first not to reject suicide as a reason for a potential death because of outdated and grossly wrong theories.

I'm sure there is plenty that I've missed, please feel free to add more.

804,IWriteThisForYou,[],1634449367,"Joanne Ratcliffe, aged 11 and born in 1962, and Kirste Gordon, aged 4 and born in 1968, were two little girls who disappeared from a sports oval in Adelaide while attending an AFL game on August 25th, 1973. Their disappearance is an assumed abduction and murder, and has long been assumed by both the media and the police to be linked to the disappearance of the Beaumont children in 1966.

Despite being one of South Australia's best known disappearances from the early '70s, the disappearance of Joanne and Kirste has never been solved. It also hasn't ever gotten the same kind of attention as the disappearance of the Beaumont children, despite the presumption of a link between the two cases. In the Australian media, this case is sometimes known as the Adelaide Oval Abductions.

Joanne Ratcliffe, the 11-year-old girl, attended the AFL game with her parents (Les and Kathleen Ratcliffe), her older brother, and a family friend (Frank). Kirste, the four-year-old, was in the care of her maternal grandmother.

The two families were seated next to each other during the game. Despite not having met previously, the two girls became friends in that way that an older child might sometimes befriend a younger one. During the game, the two girls would go to the toilet block several times together; usually unaccompanied by their parents.

However, after one of these visits the girls didn't come back. This happened at around 3:45PM. Fifteen minutes later, the Ratcliffes began searching for their children. When this search proved to be unsuccessful, Kathleen Ratcliffe tried to get an announcement made over the oval's PA system, but was initially turned down because it was presumed nobody would be able to hear the message over the football game and the cheering of the crowds.

By the time the announcement over the PA was made, it was almost 5:15 PM. By that time, it was already too late: Joanne and Kirste had already been abducted. They would never be seen again.

The police investigation into the disappearance revealed that the two girls had been seen several sightings of the girls in the hours immediately after their presumed abduction from the oval. They had been seen in the presence of an unidentified man with a thin face and blond hair--a description which happens to match the description of a man reportedly seen in the presence of the Beaumont children after their abduction.

[The South Australian police force produced a sketch of the man described to have been in the presence of Joanne and Kirste](https://crimestopperssa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kit.jpg). People who follow the news coverage of the disappearance of the Beaumont children may be familiar with this sketch already as it occasionally shows up in news reports relating to their disappearance as well.

A lot of the people who were questioned in relation to the disappearance of the Beaumont children were also questioned in relation to the Adelaide oval disappearances as well. This includes people like Bevan Spencer von Einem and Derek Percy, both of whom were convicted of killing other children.

The prime suspect in this case is a man named Arthur Stanley Brown, who died in 2002 at the age of 90. He had been charged with the rape and murder of the Mackay sisters in Townsville, Queensland, in 1970, both of whom were under the age of 10. A jury failed to reach a verdict in that case, so he was never imprisoned for his alleged involvement in the case.

However, his alleged involvement in the death of the Mackay sisters was just one crime in an ongoing history of suspected crimes against children. He was also suspected to have been involved in the death of one of his stepchildren, however this could never be proven to the point of bringing charges against him, and another of his stepdaughters accused him of having molested her as a child.

It's also interesting to note that Arthur Brown resembles the man in the sketches done for both the Adelaide oval disappearances and the disappearance of the Beaumont children.

Decades after the disappearance of Joanne and Kirste, Joanne's younger sister, Suzi Ratcliffe, started a charity called Leave A Light On, Inc. As part of her work with this charity and due to being one of the last surviving relatives of Joanne Ratcliffe, she often does media interviews in relation to the case.

In one such interview, done in 2018, Suzi called for there to be new DNA testing in relation to the case. ""It's really strange to think that there are the bones of 500 unidentified people, just sitting there in storage,"" she said during the interview. She also raised support for a nationwide DNA database for cases such as this.

In 2014, during a renewed search for evidence regarding the case, police excavated parts of a property thought to have been connected to the disappearance of the two girls. The police weren't able to find anything there. This search was the result of an anonymous tip sent to Crime Stoppers. One of the previous occupants of the property, dead since 1999, is another suspect in the disappearance.

Searches like this are just part of over 2,000 lines of inquiry investigated by police since the disappearances of these two girls in 1973.

Since 2014, the reward offered by the South Australian police for any information regarding the disappearance of Joanne Ratcliffe and Kirste Gordon has been $1,000,000.

805,vinceblight,[],1634417386,"A private search group from Oregon found the lady's car upside down at the bottom of a lake near Dallas back in February. They came back today and yesterday to see if they could find any human remains. 

Last night the lead diver told the local NPR station that his guys found bones in a pile of wreckage under water. And the lady's sister says they are bones. 

The station also had a podcast about the last a couple years ago. Here's the story from last night: 


Divers find human remains during search for missing northeast Texas woman

https://www.ketr.org/news/2021-10-15/family-human-remains-found-at-search-for-missing-northeast-texas-woman

Divers at Lake Tawakoni say they have retrieved human remains during a search for a northeast Texas woman who’s been missing since 1991.

“I can confirm that we did recover human remains today out of the remaining debris pile” from Carey Mae Parker’s car, Jared Leisek said late Friday. “We will be back in the lake tomorrow working on recovering more of the remains.”

Leisek’s group — Bend, Oregon-based Adventures With Purpose — located parts of Parker’s vehicle during its original search at Lake Tawakoni in February.

His group’s divers returned Friday with different equipment in the hopes of locating more pieces of the car and any human remains.

Parker, a young mother of three who lived in the Waco Bay area of Lake Tawakoni, disappeared along with her car in early 1991. The spot where divers found the car in February and the remains Friday is near a causeway on Waco Bay.

The remains included a pelvis bone, Parker’s sister, Patricia Gager, wrote in a Facebook post.

“She will still have to be identified through DNA, but I have no other reason to believe (it’s) not her,” she added. “RIP Carey Mae. I love you so much!”

Parker fractured her pelvis in an accident years before she went missing. That injury could prove useful in identifying any intact remains.

Divers also found pants and a shoe that might have belonged to Parker as well as a bicycle she planned to give to her son, Gager said.

A sheriff’s deputy at Lake Tawakoni said the Hunt County Sheriff’s Office would issue a statement shortly. The office didn’t immediately return calls late Friday.

Adventures With Purpose found Parker’s 1980 Buick Skylark in February, and the group agreed to return to Texas with different equipment in the fall. Other searches by Department of Public Safety divers earlier this year were unsuccessful.

Leisek said that the group would remain in the area after Saturday to help search for Roszan Payne, a different woman missing from Hunt County.

https://www.ketr.org/news/2021-02-11/group-forensic-dive-team-to-search-lake-for-missing-womans-remains

Investigators in northeast Texas are convinced that a vehicle recovered from Lake Tawakoni last week belonged to Carey Mae Parker, who went missing in 1991.
 
A private search and recovery group discovered the 1980 Buick Skylark on Feb. 4 near a causeway about five miles from Parker’s family home. There were no signs of human remains in or around the vehicle, members of the dive team said. 

Searchers used a crane and briefly shut down the causeway during the process. The operation was first reported by the Hunt County Theft Reports news website.

Ericka Miller, a press secretary for the Texas Department of Public Safety, declined to say this week if DPS officers were following up in the area.

But one of the divers who located the vehicle said Friday that a forensic dive team was preparing to continue searches of the same area.

“Yes, they do have a forensic dive team coming in to search for her and more of the car,” Jared Leisek said. “She was not inside the car. There's a forensic dive team, they'll be going back to clean up the area. And hopefully they'll be able to bring … her home.”

Leisek’s group, Bend, Oregon-based Adventures with Purpose, has recovered at least two dozen vehicles including several involved in missing person cases.

The Hunt Co. Sheriff's Office said it was processing the vehicle for evidence.

""I would like to thank the family of Carey Mae Parker for having the persistence and drive to keep pushing forward to find answers in the disappearance of their family member,"" Sheriff Terry Jones said in an emailed statement.

""It was a privilege for the sheriff’s office to be able to work with the family and Adventures with Purpose to come one step closer to bringing closure to this case, which has been needed for many years,"" Jones said.

In December 2020, one of Parker’s children contacted Adventures with Purpose seeking its assistance. This year, while the group was in Texas, one of Parker’s siblings helped divers locate areas of interest around Lake Tawakoni. After several hours at the lake Feb. 4, divers finally located the vehicle. ",Divers just pulled bones out of a Texas lake and possibly solved the 30-year-old disappearance of Carey Mae Parker

Just as UK media publishes further assertions by prosecutors in Germany that they have “new and strong” evidence with which to charge sex offender Christian Brückner over the disappearance of Madleine McCann, a new book by former PJ police coordinator Gonçalo Amaral is being launched for pre-sale, ahead of an official presentation taking place in Lisbon on October 13.

Published by Contraponto, part of the Grupo Bertrand Círculo, it presents the synopsis stressing the only certainty in this case that has already ruined the lives of so many people is that “on the night of May 3, 2007, after 10pm, in Praia da Luz on the Algarve, the alert was sounded of the disappearance of a British child, aged close to four years old”.

“Planned abduction? Abduction for motives of sexual gratification? Voluntary disappearance? Responsibility of the parents or others with the duty to look after the child? Accidental death (with or without ingestion of sleep-inducing medication)? Death hours or days before the alert over her disappearance? No-one knows. But there is a suspect. A suspect has been created without even having proved the existence of an abduction – and principally without even knowing the victim. It isn’t known, for example, if she was the target of abuse (as the episode in Mallorca would suggest). On the other hand, Maddie seems to have had speech difficulties for a four-year-old. But the child’s clinical history is missing, which constitutes a mystery. Neither did the parents provide it, nor did the British authorities permit access to it. What does the British police know? And the detectives hired by the parents? For how long will Portuguese justice maintain neutrality over a case which falls under its jurisdiction? After millions of euros and pounds spent, the family insists on the abduction theory, a pedophile is sought, German police investigate in an incongruous way and the case continues at the point it was at in 2007. Who is hiding the truth? The mysterious disappearance of a child deserves an objective, serious criticism”…

In a little over 200 words, the synopsis lays the starting point at which Amaral visits the web of misinformation that has been woven over the last 14 years.

Contraponto presents its author as a man who “for years effectively pursued all kinds of violent and organised criminality: thefts, robberies, murders, drug trafficking. He had an unblemished professional career, amply recognised by colleagues and superiors, including judicial magistrates, the Public Ministry, court officials and lawyers with whom he had the pleasure of working with for many years. His maxim is “Justice works in Silence” (click here). He was operational coordinator in the investigations of the ‘Maddie Case’ between May 3 and October 2, 2007, at which point he was removed from the investigation in an act unprecedented within the Judicial Police. He retired on July 1, 2008, after a 27 year career in the police force, in order to reacquire full freedom of expression in the case he investigated and to contribute, as far as possible, to the discovery of material truth and the realisation of justice.

808,thecoldcasesaint,[],1634405346,"I have been digging into a number of cold cases in Indiana and recently came across the cold case of Mary Beth Grismore.

On the morning of February 22, 1978, Mary Beth Grismore, 25, was planning on leaving her Marshall, IN home to move back to Iowa where she would be joining her new husband who she had just married on the 10th. She was in Marshall to pack the rest of her things and say goodbye to old friends. The night before, Grismore had gone out to Terre Haute with a few friends for dinner, a movie and little dancing. They last saw Grismore around 1:30 AM after she dropped them off that night and returned home. Her friends had come over the morning of the 22nd to help her finish packing and didn't find Grismore anywhere but did see her clothes she wore the night before and her purse. Her car was missing.

Grismore had lived in Marshall for several years and was married to a local farmer, Robert Hale, in 1972. They had two boys together but the two divorced in October 1977 supposedly on friendly terms. Grismore was still living in their house and her ex still farmed the cornfields on the property. Both the boys were with Hale the night/day Grismore disappeared. Grismore was reported missing to authorities and law enforcement saw no sign of forced entry or signs of foul play or a struggle at the scene. Friends, family and authorities searched for the former beauty queen but every lead or tip led no where.

On May 3, 1978, a car was towed from a Holiday Inn parking lot in Whitehall, Ohio after being parked in the lot for about a month according to hotel management. Police towed the car away but noticed an odd odor coming from the trunk and pried it open. Inside they found the badly decomposed body of a young woman who was later identified as Mary Beth Grismore. Her white pull-over sweater was pulled up around her neck and her blue jeans were unzipped. A clothesline-like rope was still knotted around her neck, her head was wrapped in a towel, and she covered with a blanket and an old raincoat. Police noticed a few valuable items Grismore had packed for her move including a valuable antique clock, kitchen utensils and a silver set were missing.

Ohio and Indiana authorities investigated the case and the FBI joined once Grismore was found across state lines. Grismore's name soon disappears from the papers and unless you know where to dig, you wouldn't believe or even know why the investigation just came to a halt.

It wasn't until about 20 years later when an article in World News Daily was published about Grismore and her unsolved murder. Grismore had worked as a lifeguard and gate attendant at Indiana's Turkey Run State Park the summer prior to her murder and LE spoke to her supervisor, Patrick Ralston, when she first went missing. When Grismore was found dead, they went back to interview Ralston who gave them a new story.

Ralston admitted to starting a romantic affair with Grismore in July of 1977 and both of them were married to other people at the time. Ralston's wife had just had a baby in June and underwent surgery the following month. His wife was recovering with her family in Terre Haute and Ralston said his home and life begin to feel empty so he started spending more time around the pool and the bright, bubbly, free-spirited lifeguard known as ""Pixie"" by her friends and family. Ralston said he and his wife began to drift apart and he filed for divorce in November 1977.

On January 5, 1978, Ralston was badly injured when a frozen water heater exploded at the park. He spent time in a Terre Haute hospital and then a week or so at home recovering. By mid-Feb, Ralston said things had improved with he and his and Grismore had surprised everyone by marrying a farmer back in Iowa. Ralston admitted that he and Grismore had met on February 16th at a bar in Cloverdale, Indiana for one last farewell for old times sake. Grismore even called her new husband from the hotel room she and Ralston had checked into at a nearby Holiday Inn. What Ralston said next is what caused a major issue for the FBI and their case.

Ralston tells the agents that the night Grismore met with him, she had admitted that she had met up with Birch Bayh and had slept with him. Birch Bayh was an Indiana senator who had just been re-elected and had future presidential potential. There were already rumors in Washington that Bayh and his good friend, Ted Kennedy, were involved in extra marital activities but Bayh's wife was battling breast cancer at this time. It also didn't help that Grismore had worked on Bayh's campaign and were seen in public together which would prove they knew each other. Even just the simple speculation that he did have an affair would have been the end of his political career. The FBI knew they couldn't pursue Ralston anymore because he would mention the affair with Bayh which would make Bayh just as much as a suspect in the murder as Ralston.

In my personal opinion, I don't think either Bayh or Ralston had anything to do with Grismore's death. Her first husband wasn't considered a suspect in her murder but I would like to see if I can find more about him and LE method of ruling him out. Grismore's mother said they divorced on friendly terms but I just wonder, did he know she was having an affair while married? Also she got re-married less than 6 months later. Who knows if that struck a cord with him? The fact that there was no sign of forced entry or struggle tells me she knew her murderer. Another interesting thing to note is how she was covered in the trunk. I can understand the blanket and rain coat to try and cover her up and keep the smell inside but the towel around her head is very interesting. If she was a victim of a stranger, they wouldn't take the time to wrap her head up. I also believe her murderer wanted her to be found or else why leave her in her car parked in a busy hotel near the Columbus airport?

Another suspect could be someone I don't know about possibly a neighbor or someone who may have been watching Grismore and knew she was moving. I could easily see someone offering to help her move stuff out in the morning and just strike once she let them inside the house.

Grismore's case remains a cold case in Ohio and was recently added to Indiana's list of cold cases as many started to speculate that Bayh's son, Evan, who became govenor of Indiana in 1996 abused his power of all investigative agencies by not having them work on Grismore's case. I personally don't know why Indiana would even have her listed as a cold case since she was found in Ohio. Maybe there is something I'm missing but either way, the info provided on ISP site is incorrect which tells you how much they really care about this case. At least she is still listed with Ohio.

810,randomhorror99,[],1634382127,"# Full Video here: [Finding Filippidis - The Search For The Missing Skier](https://youtu.be/_Z7603OvpO0)

*\[Post below taken from video\]*

On Wednesday 7th February 2018, 49 year old Toronto firefighter Constantinos Filippidis, or ‘Danny’ as he is known, is skiing at Whiteface Mountain in Wilmington, New York as part of an annual ski trip with off-duty and retired firefighters. The married father of two is considered to be an ‘intermediate skier’, along with the eight others who joined him on vacation. It’s the last day of their trip before they return home from Whiteface Mountain, one of the highest peaks in the Adirondacks, covered in ski trails, wooded areas, trees and rocks.

At around 2:30pm, one of the group mentions that they feel fatigued and want to leave, but Filippidis wants to have one last attempt down the mountain, so continues off alone for a final run. As his friends wait for him at the lodge, situated halfway down the mountain, a strong snowstorm hits, leading to poor visibility in the area.

Around an hour and a half later, at 4pm, the ski lifts close for the day, and Filippidis is nowhere to be seen. His friends wait a further 30 minutes before beginning to worry for his well-being, and at 4:30pm, they report him missing.

They go to check at the resort where they were staying, to see if he may have gone back, only to find his car, passport, phone and ID exactly where he had left them earlier that day. 

A search quickly begins for Filippidis on the mountain, as forest rangers, ski patrol and other skiers scour the slopes to look for the missing firefighter. As the evening draws darker, the weather conditions worsen, and despite their best efforts, Filippidis is nowhere to be found. 

The following day, more people join the search, including New York state police, homeland security, US border officials and other volunteers. When news hits home about their missing colleague, over 100 Toronto firefighters travel to Lake Placid to help with the search, with an equal number of their colleagues agreeing to backfill their shifts. Helicopters, drones and sniffer dogs are all deployed to the mountain to look for Filippidis, who was last seen wearing a green ski jacket, black helmet, goggles and red skis.

Over the next six days, around 6,000 people in total helped search for Filippidis, including his wife who travelled down to Lake Placid to help with the rescue efforts, and as days passed by, the hope that Filippidis would be found alive began to fade.

However, almost a week after going missing in New York, and against all the odds, Filippidis is found alive...

...over four and a half thousand kilometres away in California.

At 9:30am on Tuesday 13th February, Filippidis’ wife is meeting the search party in Lake Placid when she gets a phone call from an unknown number. As she answers, she hears her nickname from the voice of her lost husband and recognises it immediately. He tells her that he’s on his own at Sacramento Airport in California - approximately 4,670km west and on the other side of the country. She informs him to get help as soon as possible, so he hangs up and calls 911 to tell police he is a missing person.

When they arrive shortly after making contact, police find Filippidis at the airport’s car rental terminal, still wearing the ski clothes he had on when he went missing 6 days prior in New York, including the jacket, boots and even carrying the ski helmet.

Reports say that Filippidis was found in a disoriented state, so much so that when he was asked to describe a blue sign, he said it was green, and he didn’t know what day it was. Along with his skiing attire, he was also found carrying a newly purchased iPhone, a credit card, $1,000 in cash and had managed at some point to get a haircut.

When initially asked how he got to Sacramento from New York, he told deputies that he thinks he may have suffered a head injury as his memory was cloudy, but he remembered riding as a passenger in a ‘big rig style’ truck, and that he ‘slept a lot’. Other than that, he claims he didn’t remember anything else, and apparently didn’t even know how he had obtained a new phone to call his wife. He was immediately taken to hospital to be assessed for possible head trauma, but was later discharged with ‘no reported signs of any injuries’.

According to Sgt. Shaun Hampton of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, officers spoke with Filippidis for some time and were confident he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. They believe that Filippidis was ‘dropped off at Sacramento the night prior to him calling us’ and that he must have slept on the streets near Richards Boulevard along the Interstate 5 corridor based on what he told them. They were unclear how Filippidis got to Sacramento Airport the next day, but it’s assumed that he may have got a taxi there before calling his wife.

After the news of his discovery on the other side of the country, the press began trying to piece together the story, and Frank Ramagnano, President of the Toronto Professional Firefighters Association, answered questions on what he knew.

Further statements were made in the following days by New York and Sacramento authorities, with police distributing a picture taken of Filippidis when he was discovered, in the hopes that anyone who recognises him can come forward with information on what may have happened.

After a few days, Filippidis returned to the Adirondacks for police questioning before finally returning home to Toronto with his family and continuing his work as a captain with the Toronto Fire Services. Frank Ramagnano claims he also spoke briefly with Filippidis, but stated that he ‘didn’t ask too many questions because he didn’t want to over-stress him’.

Police appealed for the supposed truck driver that took Filippidis on his six day journey to get in touch, but to this day nobody has come forward with any new information. Speculation grew on what could have happened to the firefighter that week, and people would have to wait a further six months before hearing from Filippidis himself on his version of events. 

Filippidis states in the interview that he believes he must have taken a wrong turn on his way to the car, and lost consciousness sometime shortly after splitting up with the others. Upon coming to, he made his way to what he mistakenly believed to be the main ski lodge, only to find it closed and deserted. It was later determined that Filippidis likely fell near the children’s ski slope and made his way to the hub of kids programming, an area that’s sparsely populated and would have been closed at the time.

Still dazed and confused as to where he was, and unable to find his car, Filippidis claims he hailed down a truck to get a ride back into town, climbed into the cabin area, and began moving away from the mountain.

Filippidis claims he remembers vague moments of consciousness whilst on his journey, such as ‘being sick by the side of the road at what appeared to be a truck stop, and learning that he was driving through Utah.’ He remembers a ‘crushing headache and intense fatigue that left him unable to do little besides sleep’ as he made his way further east. Towards the end of the journey, the unnamed trucker informed Filippidis that they had reached ‘the end of the line’ in Sacramento, before dropping him off and leaving. Filippidis states that he had no idea who the driver was or what they spoke about, but that he did recall that he had a generic name which he gave to authorities. The identity of this driver is, to this day, unknown.

Upon reaching downtown Sacramento, after being missing for 5 days and with only a credit card and no ID, Filippidis decided that he needed to find a way to contact his wife. With his phone still back in New York, it’s reported that he took out $1,000 in cash from the credit card in order to buy himself a new iPhone. 

After purchasing the phone, Filippidis then claims that he couldn’t immediately remember his wife’s number, but instead searched ‘Whiteface Mountain’ online where he realised that he was a missing person. At this point, rather than calling 911 or heading straight to a police station for immediate help, he instead decided to sleep on the streets overnight near Richards Boulevard. 

The next morning, on Tuesday 13th February, Filippidis, still in his ski clothing, decided to get a ride to Sacramento Airport, and it’s at this point where he finally remembers his wife’s number. He makes contact with her, she tells him to call 911 and the police arrive to find Filippidis at the rental car terminal of the airport. 

Medical experts believe that Filippidis’ memory loss and choice of actions could be caused by one of two things. The first theory, posed by Dr. Charles Tator, a Toronto brain surgeon, is that Filippidis suffered from amnesia resulting from a concussion. He believes that the incident could be a combination of retrograde amnesia - which is the loss of memory before a blow to the head, and anterograde amnesia - the loss of memory after a blow to the head. If Filippidis sustained a significant head injury on his way down the slope, it’s possible that the following concussion could cause a loss of memory, which can last anywhere from a few seconds to 24 or 48 hours in length. This theory wouldn’t account for the whole of Filippidis’ memory loss however, with Dr. Tator himself quoted as saying that his days long episode was “unusual”.

The second theory, posed by Dr. Jennifer Ryan, a senior scientist at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest in Toronto, is that Filippidis experienced another form of amnesia - a dissociative fugue state. A fugue, being the latin term for ‘flight’, is a rare condition which can be triggered by the likes of a head injury, but it could also be sparked by a traumatic event or emotional disturbance. People with dissociative fugue temporarily lose their sense of personal identity and impulsively wander or travel away from their usual surroundings. They often become confused about who they are and might even create new identities. Outwardly, people with this disorder show no signs of illness or injury, but for whatever reason their normal behaviour changes, and they have difficulty remembering who or where they are. Dr. Ryan states that subjects typically don’t remember the travelling itself, their memory frequently kicks in when they find themselves in a new, unfamiliar location.

The problem with amnesic episodes like this is that some subjects never fully recover these lost moments, leaving them with ‘islands of memory’ that remain lost forever. This may be the case with Filippidis, and therefore we may never learn of some of the missing pieces to the puzzle unless those fragments of memory return.

What do you think happened to Danny Filippidis?

Search crews pulled from the Ohio River in Indiana an SUV that belonged to an Ohio mother who along with her two children went missing nearly two decades ago, authorities said Friday.

Side sonar scan technology led divers to the 1997 Nissan Pathfinder Thursday near Aurora in southeastern Indiana, Indiana State Police said Friday in a news release. The vehicle was registered to Stephanie Van Nguyen, who in 2002 disappeared with her 4-year-old daughter, Kristina, and 3-year-old son, John.

Nguyen, then 26, left a note that she was going to drive into the Ohio River, but her vehicle was not located at the time, police said.

813,FaithlessnessUpper19,[],1634343580,"On the evening of the 2nd of December 2010, 24 year old Phoebe Handsjuk was found dead on the floor of the refuse compactor room at the bottom of ‘Balencea’, a luxury high rise apartment building, located on St Kilda Road Melbourne. It was discovered that she had fallen feet first from the 12th floor refuse room, down the waste disposal shaft to the compactor below. She had fallen into a wheeled garbage bin and bled to death in the dark after desperately crawling out of the bin for help after her right foot was almost severed off.

. The toxicology report revealed Phoebe to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.16% and high levels of prescription drugs (specifically a sleeping pill known as Stilnox). There have been no known reported incidents of a cause of death such as this, in the history of Australia.

Victoria Police determined she had committed suicide on December 2, 2010 while a coroner ruled her death was a 'freak accident' - but her family rejected the findings. Channel Nine's Under Investigation conducted an experiment with a model of the same age and build to see if she could lift herself into an exact replica of the chute.  After multiple failed attempts she was eventually able to climb inside the 22cm latch but only with her arms directly above her head.  Detectives who examined the scene concluded her arms must have been by her side during the fall given the nature of her wounds. But in such a small space it would have been impossible to bring her arms from above her head to her side, bringing their theory into doubt. 

Such an experiment was never carried out by police, with an inquest saying Ms Handsjuk inexplicably climbed into the chute in a 'sleep-walk state' after taking a cocktail of alcohol and sleeping pills. However given the difficulty of a sober person attempting to lift themselves into the chute it appears extremely unlikely Ms Handsjuk in her intoxicated state would have had the coordination to do so.

Investigators also failed to secure all the CCTV footage from the apartment block on the night of her death and did not seize any computers and electronic devices from her apartment. When her family were eventually able to access her laptop they discovered all her outgoing emails had been deleted. ‘She had two phones. An iPhone and a Nokia phone and extraordinarily the Nokia phone has never been located,' Her grandfather said. ‘There were a lot of strange contradictions that should have been pursued by weren't.' 

Her death is ruled as a freak accident, according to a recent coroner report. What happened to Phoebe? How did she end up in the chute? Why didn’t the police properly investigate?

814,NachoPichu,[],1634342793,"Thomas Wales was a federal prosecutor who was murdered at his Seattle area home in 2001 by an unknown assailant or assailants. This month marked the 20 year anniversary and I heard on the news that the case has been turned over to prosecutors, does anyone know if this means that there's been a break in the case?

Here's background on the case as written up by u/000katie :

Tom Wales was a federal prosecutor and gun control advocate living and working in Seattle, WA. On October 11, 2001 he was working at his home in his basement office when an unknown gunmen fired multiple shots through his window and hit him in the neck. Witnesses reported a lone man fleeing the scene. The gunman left behind shell casings. Tom Wales managed to call 911 before losing conciousness and later succumbing to his wounds.

The basement office was shared by Tom's ex-wife Elizabeth. They had divorced amicably and while he kept the house, she continued to operate her business as a literary agent out of the basement during the day. Tom was not expected to be using the office that evening as he had canceled plans that he had had with his girlfriend at the last minute. Elizabeth was out of the country at the time and was never considered a suspect or motive for the crime.

It should also be noted that the basement window was not what one would think of as a typical small basement window. Many homes in Seattle are built into hillsides with ""basements"" having large, full size windows that look out on backyards. The basement window was actually a renovated picture window.

Tom Wales had become a noted gun control advocate after a classmate of his son brought a firearm to school and injured two students. Just months before he was killed, he had delivered a commencement speech at a college where he stated he had spent years ""building Washington CeaseFire into an organization that takes on the N.R.A. at every turn.""

He had been involved in a heated car accident before his murder, but neither that incident nor his romantic life provided any leads for authorities. There is some discussion that the murderer knew or was stalking Tom as they avoided the motion detector lights in the yard and knew that he occasionally worked in his basement at night.

Authorities investigated and charged a local pilot and gun enthusiast whom Wales had prosecuted, but no charges were filed. There is currently a one million dollar reward for information leading to the solving of this case.

815,Crierrr,[],1634331703,"On the 8th of September in 1863, an unidentified man was found on the beach of Sandy Cove, Nova Scotia. The unidentified man was found with both his legs amputated, and was carried back to the nearby village of Digby Neck for medical attention. One of the doctors nursing him back to health noted that the amputations were quite recent, as the stumps that were heavily bandaged still bled, and that it was amputated by a skilled surgeon. He did not appear to speak much, mostly muttering unintelligible words. When asked about his name, he mumbled something that resembled 'Jerome', and that's what he was known as since. Since he was first discovered, Jerome was moved from house to house and lived years in each, before he died in 1912. 

Many theories of who Jerome was and where he came from have been raised throughout the years. Some believed that Jerome was a sailor who attempted a mutiny and failed, and had his legs amputated as punishment. Others believed that Jerome was a nobleman from Italy, who had his legs amputated as revenge, and had decided to shut himself off from the world to protect himself from political enemies. One of the recent theories that has garnered attention was the one proposed by Fraser Mooney Jr in 2008 in his book named *""Jerome: Solving The Mystery Of Nova Scotia's Silent Castaway"".* He reports in the book that a few years prior to Jerome's appearance at Sandy Cove, there was a foreigner who had fallen through river ice in Chipman, New Brunswick. The foreigner suffered gangrene in both his legs after the accident, and had to have them amputated by the local surgeon. He muttered ""Gamby"" when addressed, and this was what he was called at his time in New Brunswick. It is likely he was referring to his leg at the time, which is 'Gamba' in Italian. 

The residents of Chipman, New Brunswick did not take well to this stranger due to his violent personality, and his unwillingness to reveal his identity. He was soon arranged to be transported away. Mooney believes that Gamby was transported to Sandy Cove Nova Scotia, and was later known as Jerome. Some have been critical of Mooney's book, stating that it is entirely speculative. Regardless, there are official documents of Gamby's existence, and many witnesses at the time believe that Gamby and Jerome were the same person. 

As Jerome's story was passed from generation to generation, there have been quite a few alterations to his narrative. For example, there are multiple accounts as to who found him at Sandy Cove, Nova Scotia. Some sources state that fishermen did, while others state that an eight year old boy named George Colin Albright had found him and hurried to the village to ask for help, and his family was the first to house Jerome. Another example is his demeaner. While some sources state that he had a rough personality who shunned the attention of everyone, others state that he was quite talkative and friendly when he was among children. As all the first hand accounts of Jerome are now gone, and his story is passed down throughout the years, it is to be expected that more than a bit of imagination may be added to it.

816,MaddiKate,[],1634321031,"Hello, I am back with another cold case from the Gem State. It's been a *minute*, but I have some PTO today so I figured it would be a good time to sit down and do a write-up. 

Jon Clair Barrett [DOB: 05/12/1940] was an older gentleman who lived in Pocatello, ID. Jon was known to be a unique individual but loved by the community. His hobbies included frequenting thrift shops, hanging out with his friends downtown, taking care of his dogs, and spending time with his children and grandchildren. As you can see from his pictures, he had impeccable taste in fashion. 

The details of what happened on that fateful night of November 9, 2008 are scant. But at some point that evening, Jon disappeared into the cold Idaho night, and was never seen again. He left his dogs at the house, which was not characteristic of him- he took his dogs with him everywhere he could. He also left behind the medications he used to manage his diabetes, which drew immediate concern from his family. The only thing that went missing with him was his light green Dodge Caravan. However, this van was mysteriously returned to his house about a day later. Jon was, and is, still nowhere to be found.

While he has never officially been named a person of interest, suspicion over the years has turned to Jon's longtime friend, Randall Toole. He is, allegedly, the last person to see Jon alive before he went missing. He has also engaged in suspicious behavior in the time following. In May 2009, Randall was arrested in Las Vegas for fraudulent credit card use. Turns out this card belonged to his friend, Jon Barrett. Randall alleged that he had Jon's permission to use the credit card and only put about $18 on it while making a purchase at the Ross department store in Pocatello. However, Randall decided to plead no contest and served time on probation to avoid further legal action. He continued to deny involvement in Jon's disappearance. 

To add some fuel to the fire (pun not intended), in 2015, a large house south of Pocatello mysteriously caught fire and was completely decimated. The cause has been ruled ""inconclusive."" Who owned this house? Randall Toole. No one, including Randall, was in the house at the time it burned down. It is unclear if this fire is connected to the case.

This case has stumped the family for years. In a 2010 interview with his son, Bryan Lloyd, he discussed being unsure of what happened. Bryan expressed skepticism towards Randall, reporting that he did not believe his father would ever loan anyone his credit card. Yet he also does not believe Jon left the area voluntarily, especially given his large family, his dogs, and his health. 

What happened to Jon Barrett nearly 13 years ago? Is Randall Toole connected to his disappearance? What motive would someone have to potentially harm Jon?

818,Kaiser_Allen,[],1634312396,"[*The Daily Beast*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/we-finally-know-how-43-ayotzinapa-students-on-a-bus-vanished-into-thin-air)*:*

&gt;Transcripts of newly released text messages between a crime boss and a deputy police chief have finally lifted the lid on the mystery of 43 students who went missing one night in southwestern Mexico.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The messages indicate that the cops and the cartel worked together to capture, torture, and murder at least 38 of the 43 student teachers who went missing in September of 2014.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The students had made the deadly mistake of commandeering several buses in order to drive to Mexico City for a protest. It now seems clear that those buses were part of a drug-running operation that would carry a huge cargo of heroin across the U.S. border—and the students had accidentally stolen the load.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Gildardo López Astudillo was the local leader of the Guerreros Unidos cartel at that time. He was in charge of the area around the town of Iguala, in southwestern Mexico, where the students were last seen. Francisco Salgado Valladares was the deputy chief of the municipal police force in the town.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;On Sept. 26, 2014, Salgado texted López to report that his officers had arrested two groups of students for having taken the busses. Salgado then wrote that 21 of the students were being held on a bus. López responded by arranging a transfer point on a rural road near the town, saying he “had beds to terrorize” the students in, likely referencing his plans to torture and bury them in clandestine grave sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Police chief Salgado next wrote that he had 17 more students being held “in the cave,” to which López replied that he “wants them all.” The two then made plans for their underlings to meet at a place called Wolf’s Gap, and Salgado reminded López to be sure to send enough men to handle the job.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Aside from a few bone fragments, the bodies of the students have never been found.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A bit later that night, Salgado also informed the crime boss that “all the packages have been delivered.” This appears to be a reference to the fact that one or more of the busses commandeered by the students had, unbeknownst to them, been loaded with heroin that the Guerreros Unidos had intended to smuggle north toward the U.S. border.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike Vigil, the DEA’s former chief of international operations, told The Daily Beast that this strongly implies that López was calling the shots all along, ordering Salgado to arrest the students lest they accidentally hijack his shipment of dope.",Solved: How 43 Students on a Bus in Southwestern Mexico Vanished Into Thin Air
819,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1634312127,"“A vehicle connected to the disappearance of a mother and her two children nearly 20 years ago has been recovered from the Ohio River, according to the Delhi Township Police Department. 

Stephanie Van Nguyen, 26, went missing from Rising Sun, Indiana in April 2002 along with her two children, 4-year-old Kristina Nguyen and 3-year-old John Nguyen.

Nguyen left a note saying she was going to drive into the Ohio River, police said. She and her children were never found and the case eventually went cold until police reopened it this year. 

Over the last six months, Delhi police have been working with the Hamilton County Police Association Dive Team and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,  using sonar technology to scan the river, according to a news release.

Searchers detected three unique objects in the water last week which police said ""looked promising."" 

On Wednesday, dive teams were called to the scene and the vehicle, a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder, in which Nguyen and her children were last seen, was discovered in Aurora, Indiana, the release state. 

Officials said the vehicle was pulled out of the water and Delhi police are working with Indiana State Police to figure out if Nguyen and her children were inside the vehicle.”

Maybe that child was a “bad” kid — so the police assume he ran away and the family is more relieved that he is gone than they are worried by his absence. Maybe he was always skipping school, always finding his way to trouble somehow, so running away was just one more thing on a list of bad behaviors.

Nicholas Barclay was thirteen years old when he disappeared on June 10, 1994. His family reported him missing three days later, on June 13, 1994, one day before Nicholas had a family court date to determine whether or not he would be sent to a group home.

**Nicholas’s teachers had noticed some unexplained bruises on the boy and had reported their suspicions of abuse to Child Protective Services just before he went missing, but when he went missing he was assumed to be a runaway and no foul play was suspected.**

Nicholas was a “bad” boy — he had stolen a pair of tennis shoes, he had skipped school on a regular basis, he’d allowed his friends to unhygienically and amateurishly tattoo him, and he probably even used swear words — so, of course, he had run away.

**Investigators focused on the fact that Nicholas was BAD instead of focusing on the fact that he was a thirteen-year-old BOY, just as they too often focus on a missing woman being a sex worker instead of being a missing woman. The labels of our society might as well be tags tied on the toe of a corpse headed to the morgue — once the label is fixed, so too is your fate.**

But Nicholas Barclay got lucky, in a sense, because someone did notice that he was gone.

In October of 1997, Nicholas’s mother and sister were contacted by the FBI. There was a boy in Linares, Spain who had told authorities there that he was the missing child, Nicholas Barclay. Carey Gibson, Nicholas’s half-sister, spoke to the teenager on the phone, as did his mother, Beverly Dollarhide. Their conversations were brief but were acted on immediately.

Carey raised the money through her work for a ticket to Europe and flew to Spain to reunite with her kid brother and bring him home. When she arrived, she met with Nicholas and then swore in front of a judge that the teenager was her missing brother. A U.S. passport was issued for Nicholas and he and Carey returned home to San Antonio, Texas on October 18, 1997.

At the airport, Carey’s husband Bryan and their two children were waiting anxiously for their arrival. So was Nicholas’s mother, Beverly. But his big brother, Jason, had not come to the airport to welcome Nicholas home and wouldn’t even see his kid brother for two more months.

The day that Nicholas had gone missing, he had played a game of basketball with some friends and then had called home for a ride. His brother, Jason, had answered the phone.

Jason had only recently moved in with his mother after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction, but Beverly had taken Jason in with the hope that having his older brother in the house would make it easier for her to get control of Nicholas, who had been acting up.

Beverly worked the graveyard shift, from 10 pm to 5 am, seven days a week at a Dunkin’ Donuts in San Antonio so when Nicholas had called for a ride on June 10, 1994, Beverly had been asleep. Jason had told Nicholas that he wasn’t going to wake their mom up just to give him a ride home and that Nicholas should walk.

Nicholas was never seen or heard from again.

Perhaps Jason felt so much guilt over that phone call that he couldn’t bring himself to go to the airport.

Nicholas had told his sister that he had been kidnapped and brought to Europe by a child sex ring, that they wouldn’t allow him to speak English for the three years that he had been gone, and that the kidnappers had even gone so far as to dye his normally blue eyes the color brown to disguise his identity. Any child that had gone through that kind of hell would surely blame his older brother for not getting him a ride home on the day that he had been kidnapped.

**But there were bigger mysteries at the airport than just the absence of Nicholas’s brother.**

Why were his blue eyes now brown?

Why did he speak English poorly and with a European accent when he had only been gone for three years?

And why did his mother, Beverly, want him to go and live with his sister and her husband instead of taking her long-lost boy into her arms and her home?

So many mysteries, but the important question had now been answered: Nicholas was alive and he was home.

Local media covered the family’s reunion and even the tabloid show, Hard Copy, wanted to send a crew out to interview Nicholas and his family. But first, Hard Copy hired a private investigator, Charlie Parker, to look into Nicholas’s kidnapping.

A lie, once spoken, can sometimes leave a certain subtle lemony odor on the air — a sourness where there should be neutrality. And sometimes a lie is so big that even a smoker infected with covid who has lost all sense of smell would still wrinkle their nose in the presence of such a whopper.

When P.I. Charlie Parker came to Carey and Bryan Gibson’s trailer with the Hard Copy camera crew to interview Carey’s brother, Nicholas, he smelled the b.s. immediately as it floated toward him in an inexplicable European accent. Every time “Nicholas” spoke, Parker was floored by that accent.

Parker told the camera crew to zoom in on Nicholas’s ears. He had read that our ears are almost as unique as our fingerprints and he wanted a good shot to compare to the old pictures of Nicholas.

**After leaving Carey’s home, Parker continued with his investigation — but he was no longer investigating a kidnapping, he was investigating a fraud.**

The private investigator called ophthalmologists and discovered that the story that “Nicholas” had told was impossible — there was no way to turn blue eyes brown with an injection. He then contacted a professor at Trinity University in San Antonio and confirmed his suspicion that Nicholas could not have completely lost his natural American accent after only three years.

**The lost boy was a conman.**

Parker didn’t know who the person was that he had interviewed, but he was certain that it wasn’t Nicholas Barclay.

He called Beverly Dollarhide and told her, with great regret, that the person staying with her daughter was not her long-lost son, but an imposter. Beverly did not believe the private investigator.

Perhaps she didn’t want to believe that her hopes were all dashed and that her son was still lost out there somewhere. Or maybe she just didn’t want the private investigator to keep asking questions.

A month after “Nicholas” had returned to the U.S. with his sister Carey, he was interviewed by FBI Agent Nancy Fisher and taken to be examined by a forensic psychiatrist who concluded that the person calling himself Nicholas was not American and therefore could not be Nicholas Barclay.

The FBI reported their findings to Beverly and Carey, who both staunchly refused to believe what law enforcement had told them — or even the evidence available to their own eyes and ears. The new “Nicholas” looked and sounded nothing like their own Nicholas who had gone missing. Their blue-eyed blond-haired American brother and son had returned to them with brown hair dyed blond, brown eyes, and a European accent.

**Was Nicholas’s family in such a state of grief and their denial so profound that they had latched onto the story of a conman and held to it despite all evidence to the contrary? Or did they know more about Nicholas’s disappearance than they had said? Did they want the world to think that Nicholas was back home, safe and sound because they knew that he would actually never return?**

FBI Agent Fisher’s suspicions led her to ask Beverly Dollarhide for a DNA sample so that she could compare it to DNA from the new “Nicholas”. Beverly refused and in February 1998, Agent Fisher got warrants to force both Beverly and the new “Nicholas” to give samples of their DNA.

&gt;*“I go to her house to get a blood sample, and she lies on the floor and says she’s not going to get up.” — FBI Agent Fisher*

Fisher got the blood samples, despite the resistance of Beverly.

A month later, while DNA testing was still ongoing, Beverly Dollarhide called Charlie Parker and told him that she believed that this “Nicholas” was an imposter. Odd timing, that.

The next day, Parker took the new “Nicholas” to a diner and, while they were talking, the imposter confessed.

He was not Nicholas Barclay, the missing teenager from San Antonio, Texas. He was Frederic Bourdin, a twenty-four-year-old conman from France who was wanted by Interpol.

At this point in our story, I should be writing some melodramatic fluff about the compounding of this family's grief by the vicious and heartless conman from France.

Or I could go the route taken by many others who have written (and made a movie) about this case and focus on the fascinating tale of Frederic Bourdin.

How did he do it? How did he believe that he *could* do it? How many times had he pretended to be a child? And why did he do it? Bourdin wasn’t conning anyone out of money, he conned people out of love.

He stole love from people, whether by pretending to be their child or just a child who was vulnerable and in need. Why did he have to be a conman just to accomplish that?

I’m not going to write about the grief of this lost boy's family, nor will I write some spy-novel type treatment of Frederic Bourdin. I don’t read spy novels and Bourdin also seems quite boring and sad to me. I’m sorry he wasn’t loved enough as a child. None of us were. Especially Nicholas Barclay.

After Bourdin confessed, the FBI and the federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Jack Stick, focused their attention on the disappearance of Nicholas Barclay. They called Beverly in for a polygraph, which she passed, and then gave her another one a few hours later. (The polygraph examiner had suggested that he might have gotten a false reading the first time if Beverly had been on drugs.) Beverly failed the second polygraph exam spectacularly.

Nicholas’s older brother Jason refused to be interviewed, at first, but eventually submitted to one interview where he gave very short and vague answers. He then refused to speak to investigators again without a lawyer present.

When Nicholas went missing, Jason had been the last one to speak to him and Beverly remembered giving him five bucks to go play basketball. A month after his disappearance, on July 12, 1994, Beverly had called the police but told them that everything was okay when they arrived. Jason told the police then that his mother was “drinking and scream(ing) at him because her other son ran away.”

A few weeks later, Beverly had called the police again when she and Jason were in an argument. The cops told Jason to leave the house and stay gone for the rest of the day. A month after that, on September 25, 1994, Jason called the police and told them that Nicholas had come back and had just tried to break into their garage.

Beverly had called the police twice on Jason in the months after Nicholas’s disappearance and Jason had probably lied to the police about Nicholas’s return and attempted break-in as an effort toward convincing the police that Nicholas was safe when he was so clearly not.

**A few weeks after the conman Bourdin’s confession, Jason (perhaps intentionally) overdosed on cocaine.**

Federal prosecutor, Jack Stick, found that there was not enough evidence to charge anyone in connection with the disappearance of Nicholas Barclay and stated that Jason’s overdose “precluded the possibility” that their investigation could ever find out what happened to Nicholas.

A conman felt that the only way he could ever be loved was by pretending to be a vulnerable child but the real Nicholas Barclay *was* a vulnerable child and he was never guaranteed love, only vulnerability.

He was a bad kid, remember? We should expect kids like that to run away just like we should expect ourselves not to care unless some really cool conman master-of-disguise gets involved.

**Readers note: I was a bad kid too. Most authors were. Beautiful things come from people who struggle. We’re worth looking for when we go missing.**

He stole love from people, whether by pretending to be their child or just a child who was vulnerable and in need. Why did he have to be a conman just to accomplish that?

I’m not going to write about the grief of this lost boy's family, nor will I write some spy-novel type treatment of Frederic Bourdin. I don’t read spy novels and Bourdin also seems quite boring and sad to me. I’m sorry he wasn’t loved enough as a child. None of us were. Especially Nicholas Barclay.

After Bourdin confessed, the FBI and the federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Jack Stick, focused their attention on the disappearance of Nicholas Barclay. They called Beverly in for a polygraph, which she passed, and then gave her another one a few hours later. (The polygraph examiner had suggested that he might have gotten a false reading the first time if Beverly had been on drugs.) Beverly failed the second polygraph exam spectacularly.

Nicholas’s older brother Jason refused to be interviewed, at first, but eventually submitted to one interview where he gave very short and vague answers. He then refused to speak to investigators again without a lawyer present.

When Nicholas went missing, Jason had been the last one to speak to him and Beverly remembered giving him five bucks to go play basketball. A month after his disappearance, on July 12, 1994, Beverly had called the police but told them that everything was okay when they arrived. Jason told the police then that his mother was “drinking and scream(ing) at him because her other son ran away.”

A few weeks later, Beverly had called the police again when she and Jason were in an argument. The cops told Jason to leave the house and stay gone for the rest of the day. A month after that, on September 25, 1994, Jason called the police and told them that Nicholas had come back and had just tried to break into their garage.

Beverly had called the police twice on Jason in the months after Nicholas’s disappearance and Jason had probably lied to the police about Nicholas’s return and attempted break-in as an effort toward convincing the police that Nicholas was safe when he was so clearly not.

**A few weeks after the conman Bourdin’s confession, Jason (perhaps intentionally) overdosed on cocaine.**

Federal prosecutor, Jack Stick, found that there was not enough evidence to charge anyone in connection with the disappearance of Nicholas Barclay and stated that Jason’s overdose “precluded the possibility” that their investigation could ever find out what happened to Nicholas.

A conman felt that the only way he could ever be loved was by pretending to be a vulnerable child but the real Nicholas Barclay *was* a vulnerable child and he was never guaranteed love, only vulnerability.

He was a bad kid, remember? We should expect kids like that to run away just like we should expect ourselves not to care unless some really cool conman master-of-disguise gets involved.

**Readers note: I was a bad kid too. Most authors were. Beautiful things come from people who struggle. We’re worth looking for when we go missing.**

Neither rings a bell for me, and a couple of hours of searching with the details I’ve listed below aren’t yielding results. I’m hoping someone here - perhaps someone local to where they occurred - can help.

**Case #1**

- the victims first name was Melanie or Melody
- she was killed in the early to mid 70’s, but possibly as early as the late 60’s
- she lived in or around Toms River, NJ
- she was ~14 when she was murdered
- she was thought to have encountered her killer while she was hitchhiking 
- her body was found with an “x” slashed across her chest 
- other teens and/or women were found dead in the same geographical area, in the same time period, with either an “x” or an “o” cut into their chest (it’s possible that this portion of the story was more local lore than fact)

**Case #2** *(I apologize for vague details!)*

- this occurred sometime between 2000-2015
- victim was in her late teens to early 20’s
- she had moved to somewhere in the southwest (maybe Arizona?) from another state (maybe California?)
- she had moved to this state for work as a nanny
- worried family in her home state reported her missing after not hearing from her for at least several weeks, possibly longer
- victim was found deceased some time after going missing, but not longer than a couple of years 

Again, apologies for the vague details, especially regarding the second case. Tomorrow is my last day of my current job and I would love to surprise my coworkers with an update or actual outcome of either of these cases!

Durst was given life without parole after a conviction for murder with special circumstances. In California, this crime is punishable only by life without parole and the death penalty. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty so the sentence was basically a formality after his guilty verdict.

Durst is no stranger to the courtroom but is a stranger to conviction. Durst has long been suspected of other murders, including that of his wife back in the 1980s.

Durst re-entered the news cycle during the filming of the HBO documentary ""The Jinx"", in which he appeared to confess to multiple murders during the series' final episode.

&gt; A homeless man who walked into a police station to admit to a killing he committed almost 40 years ago has been jailed for life for murder.
&gt; 
&gt; Anthony Kemp was 21 when he bludgeoned Christopher Ainscough with a marble ashtray after they met on a night out in London in December 1983.
&gt; 
&gt; Now aged 59, Kemp confessed to the killing in July, telling police ""I'm not going to sleep on the streets.""
&gt; 
&gt; He was sentenced at the Old Bailey to a minimum of 15 and a half years in jail.
&gt; 
&gt; The court previously heard Mr Ainscough, 50, had invited Kemp back to his home in Kilburn in the early hours of the morning and was on the sofa when he was attacked.
&gt; 
&gt; His body was found after the head waiter failed to turn up for work at a restaurant in the City.
&gt; 

&gt; The original murder investigation was closed in 1985 when no leads were found, but was reopened after Kemp confessed to the killing.

&gt; On 28 July he turned up at Chiswick police station and began throwing stones at the window.
&gt; 
&gt; He then told an officer he had murdered someone 40 years ago, explaining that: ""I'd rather do the last few years of my life in bang-up than sleep on the streets.""
&gt; 
&gt; The court heard that Kemp told police he ""bashed"" his victim's ""brains in"" during an argument, but he did not know what had sparked the row.

Not a case I'd ever heard of it, and it looks like it was pretty much forgotten from 1985 until now. Seems like one that would have gone unsolved forever, if not for this confession. There's a statement from one of the victim's friends in the article, I'm glad people like that were able to get some kind of resolution after all this time.

""At 10:45 p.m. on June 9, 1995 in Alma,  Arkansas, 6-year-old Morgan Nick was abducted from a little league ball  game by an unidentified man. She was attending the game with her mother  and had joined some friends to catch lightning bugs. Morgan was last  seen standing near her mother’s car where she had stopped to empty sand  from her shoes.

Witnesses observed a man watching the youngster as  she was playing with other children at the park. The witness also saw a  red Ford pickup with a white camper parked nearby that disappeared at  about the same time as Morgan. The camper is possibly damaged at the  right rear, and was described as four or five inches too short for the  truck, which has a short wheel base and paint dulled by age. The truck  is believed to have Arkansas license plates.

The man was described  as white, 6 feet tall, with a medium to solid build, a mustache and a  1-inch beard. At the time, he was believed to be 23-38 years old.""","Still Missing Morgan, about Morgan Nick's disappearance, coming this Winter"

For those not familiar with this tragic case, u/slimcrickens did an [excellent write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/een1rb/the_10_hanging_bodies_mass_suicide_or_murder/) two years ago.

It was actually  [u/dyslexicpancrea](https://www.reddit.com/user/dyslexicpancreas)  who brought this [Netflix documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/81095095), which is in three parts, to my attention, for which I'm grateful, because this case has always been one of those that haunted. Not because it's unsolved, because technically it is. Officially the police ruled it a mass suicide.

But for many the case feels unresolved, something that this documentary explores rather thoroughly, and which I thought kept it relevant to this sub.

A quick summary of the case for the unfamiliar:

In July of 2018, in the Burari district of Dehli, India, eleven members of a single family, spanning three generations, were found dead in their home. Not just dead, but hanged, their mouths gagged and their hands bound. They ranged in age from 12 to 80. Ten had been hanged from a grating in the ceiling of the first floor roof, and the last, the grandmother, was strangled while lying on her side because she was too weak to be with the others. 

At first everyone thought it must be a case of mass murder. The more the case was delved into, though, the more the police realized it was a case of mass suicide. This explanation has left many unsatisfied, especially some loved ones and friends, who cannot believe that this family who was 100% normal, warm and loving and friendly, would all kill themselves - let alone in such horrifying fashion.

The write-up linked above covers the details of the case well, so I won't repeat them all here. The important part is that the police found diaries that detailed not just the 'ritual' that resulted, accidentally or otherwise, in the deaths of the family, but a history of what amounted to cult like behavior by the family. In the aftermath of the patriarch's death, his son Lilat filled the vacuum that was left, and claimed to be possessed by the spirit of his late father, and he essentially had tight control over the family.

There is more detail to the story and events, but my focus is on the documentary, which is heartbreaking and very well done. One of the topics it covers thoroughly is something we grapple with as true crime 'fans' - the way that in the aftermath of discovering the bodies, the story immediately was sensationalized, treated as some grisly, delightful horror story. The police hadn't even arrived on scene before somebody had crept around the house filming a video to upload everywhere. They struggled to get ambulances in to take away the bodies because there were so many people crowded in hoping to get a look at the bodies/crime scene.

News channels played up the numerology elements and other such things, one woman was harassed for compelling the family to suicide even though she'd never met the family. The contractor accused of assisting the family because of some pipes he installed sounded so bitter and tired as he explained how he'd had no role whatsoever.

Everyone saw it as a story to be horrified and mystified by, and forgot that eleven people, three generations of a single family, were dead.

Another thing it addressed was mental health. Lalit suffered a head trauma in a traffic accident, and later his employer attempted to kill him. Lalit was advised to speak with a therapist, and his family told to encourage him to do so, but the stigma against therapy is so strong that it never happened. How different might things have gone if he'd gotten help? It's a question no one will ever be able to answer.

Might things have also been different if there was not also a stigma against keeping family matters private? You see this a lot in domestic abuse cases and the like as well. The family presented a front of being happy, friendly, working hard to reach their goals. They'd just celebrated an engagement of one of the daughters (which the documentary believes may have been Lalit's tipping point - he was losing a member of his family, losing control of them). They had everything to live for, and according to the diaries fully believed they would be alive the next day.

At least, most of them did. Another unresolved component of this tragedy is who exactly knew what. Did Lalit intend for them all to die? Was his wife complicit? Did they all do this willingly, or were some of them forced to do it? Is this suicide? Murder? Accidental death? There's no real label for this kind of tragedy. The answer is on the surface simple - they performed a ceremony and it killed them. The answer is, as the documentary states, also incredibly complicated, because this wasn't simply a case of a family drawn into a mass psychosis that killed them. There was a much larger picture of society, of what's acceptable and what's taboo, of the way cases like this are turned into grisly dime novel type thrill stories and never given the true attention and discussion they merit.

The documentary closes with saying that until we're willing to have the hard discussions, instead of enjoying the thrill and then letting the problems slide away to enjoy the next thrill, tragedies like this will continue to occur.

829,Rustamchik228,[],1634216990,"September 30 marks exactly 32 years of an unusual incident in Voronezh. It was on this date in 1989, according to reports of a large number of people, that an unidentified flying object (UFO) landed in this city. It happened in the so-called Kozliny Park (now - Yuzhny Park) in the area of ​​Mendeleeva Street, Nebolsina Street, and Novosibirskaya Street. After this event, a group of concerned people came to the editorial office of the ""Kommuna"" newspaper. They claimed to have witnessed an alien visit. After that, Voronezh did not leave the pages of not only domestic, but also world media.

In 1989, journalists went to Kozliny Park together with a group of Voronezh residents and tried to reconstruct the chronology of events. The teenagers in attendance claimed that on September 30, they saw a brightly luminous sphere descending from the sky to the ground. During landing, this unidentified flying object (clearly of extraterrestrial origin) touched a poplar, which caused the tree to tilt.

Then, as the teenagers said, two creatures emerged from the sphere. One was about three meters tall. He allegedly had three eyes and a silvery skin color. The second one was small and moved like a robot. After a while, one of the aliens, according to the stories of teenagers, said something and looked at one of the boys. The creature pointed an object resembling a pistol at the child. From this, the boy allegedly disappeared, and then reappeared. Children who saw this picture fled from the park.

Having heard all these stories, the journalists began to question the residents of the neighboring houses. They confirmed that they saw an incomprehensible sphere in the sky from the windows. And after the release of a short article about the UFO visit to Kozliny Park, letters from some other witnesses of the incident began to come to the newspaper. ""Kommuna"" eventually released a second article called *Football with Aliens* by Alexander Mosolov. The text described in more detail the incident seen by the teenagers.

*“Vasya Surin and Zhenya Blinov are students: one of School No. 82, the other of School No. 33. They were united by an incredible event. These guys and Yulia Sholokhova, and about forty adults who witnessed the landing... of a UFO in the park near the Mashmet stopping ground on September 27. And it was like this.*

*The guys in the park were playing football. It was late afternoon. At half-past six, the boys saw a pink glow in the sky, and then a red-burgundy sphere. A sphere about 10 meters in diameter circled at a height of 12 meters from the ground, and it was visible how the grass crumpled under it. Soon the sphere flew away.*

*A few minutes later, the UFO returned, hovering over the park. By this time, the adults came running. A hatch opened in the lower part of the ball, a creature of about three meters in height appeared in a silvery overalls and “boots” of a bronze color, with some kind of disk on its chest and with three eyes. The creature, having examined the area, slammed the hatch, and the ball began to descend, hitting the poplar, which remained tilted. UFO has landed. The creature opened the hatch again. Two came out - one, apparently a robot. The alien said something, a luminous rectangle 30x50 centimeters in size appeared on the ground, the alien said something again. The glowing rectangle is gone. The alien poked around on the robot's chest, and it went like a mechanical one.*

*At this time, one of the boys screamed in fear. The stranger looked at him, and the boy froze, could not move. The alien's eyes shone at the same time. Everyone who saw this phenomenon shouted. The sphere and the creature disappeared. About five minutes later, they appeared again. On his side hung a ""pistol"" - a tube half a meter long. Nearby was a teenager of about sixteen. The alien pointed a ""pistol"" at him and the teenager disappeared. The alien entered the sphere, and it, gaining speed, flew away. The disappeared teenager immediately appeared...*

*This story of the UFO landing is recorded from the testimony of several eyewitnesses. It can be added to it that the residents of Putilina Street observed more than once the appearance of UFOs during the period of September 23-29. Ufologists call such a burst of activity a ""flap"", which is usually associated with a UFO landing.""*

*Football with Aliens* was noticed by TV broadcasters, and then by the Western media. From all over the planet, journalists and ufologists rushed to Voronezh. The UFO visit to Voronezh has become the number one topic on the pages of many publications. For example, The New York Times wrote: *“It is not a joke, nor a hoax, nor a sign of mental instability, nor an attempt to drum up local tourism by drawing the curious, the Soviet  press agency Tass insisted today in discussions of what it called an  extraterrestrial visit to southern Russia.""*  In turn, the article *Football with Aliens* named the kids who allegedly saw the aliens.

A decade later, the names of the schoolchildren sounded again. This time in the ""Pioneer"" magazine. Yulia Sholokhova, who was mentioned in the ""Kommuna"", had moved from the vicinity of Kozliny Park by that time. Elena Sorokina (from among the contactees such as Surin, Blinov and Sholokhova) continued to live in a high-rise building near the landing site. The girls who did not communicate, according to them, for 7-8 years, equally retell the story of the alleged UFO visit. But only Elena remembered the disappeared boy.

The kids who said they had seen aliens were asked by delegations from Japan, France, Spain, India. The children sketched what they saw.

One boy said that he saw the letters ""Ж"" on the visitor's suit. Foreigners gave presents to children. This is the only thing that the residents of Voronezh have left in memory of the incident.

Julia Sholokhova, according to her own words, heard an insistent voice in her head in an incomprehensible language some time later. When she tried to drown it out with her own speech, her voice also was gaining momentum. She begged to be left behind, and the voice, tormenting her a bit more, disappeared. Julia admitted that she did not regret it at all: she said that the voice could have chosen a less traumatic way of dialogue since it had taken the initiative.

In 2015, a Japanese toy company put on a toy line of Voronezh ""Visiter"". When creating sketches, the author used eyewitness descriptions, which, according to one version, were published in one of the issues of the Japanese magazine *Secret Chronicles*.  Soon the entire line was sold out. On the eve of the Halloween celebration, a photo of an entire installation of figures of a Voronezh alien appeared on a blogger C.Q.B  GHOST's Twitter account.

The next day, November 15, the body of 17 year old Marcel was found in the truck. He had been shot by a rifle. The truck was parked on a back road near Saint-Antoine, New Brunswick, Canada. Marcel's girlfriend, 14 year old Marcia Leblanc, had disappeared and was presumed abducted. The area was popular with hunters.

On Nov. 21, 1993, police interviewed 34 year old Roger Leblanc (no relation to Marcia). He was known as a patron of an after hours bar nearby. Roger disappeared the next day, and has not been seen since. Initially, it was thought that he had gotten lost while hunting. Police soon learned that Roger had deliberately disappeared into the wilderness. Some of his belongings were found in the Canaan River area 

In October 1994, a hunter found partial human remains and clothing within a couple of kilometres of where Marcel was murdered. Marcia's mother identified the clothing as Marcia's. The RCMP say that the remains belong to Marcia, but her parents disagree. They personally had the remains tested in a Vancouver lab, and they claim the results didn't match with Marcia. The police tested the remains again, and maintain that they are Marcia's remains.

To this day, Roger Leblanc is still missing. The RCMP classify him as a person of interest.

Oct. 12, 2021
HAMPTON, S.C. — Curtis Edward Smith, a handyman and former logger, had done his share of odd jobs over the years for Alex Murdaugh, a lawyer and scion of one of the most powerful legal families in the South Carolina Lowcountry.

But Mr. Smith said he was reluctant to do the last job Mr. Murdaugh asked for when the two men met at the side of a rural road one Saturday in September.

“I want you to shoot me in the back of the head,” Mr. Smith recalled Mr. Murdaugh telling him. He said Mr. Murdaugh had a loaded gun in his hand.

The unsettling tale grew stranger still when, 10 days later, state law enforcement agents arrested Mr. Smith, 61, accusing him of collaborating with Mr. Murdaugh in a botched scheme to kill him. Mr. Murdaugh hatched the plan to make his death look like a murder, the police said, in the hope that his elder son would receive a $10 million life insurance payment at a time when Mr. Murdaugh’s life was unraveling in spectacular fashion.

That unraveling is now at the center of a sprawling saga of mysterious deaths — including the unsolved killing of Mr. Murdaugh’s wife and younger son — and allegations of multimillion-dollar swindles and abuses of trust and power. The drama has sent a shock through South Carolina, where Alex Murdaugh and his family have dominated the legal profession in a rural swath of the state for more than a century.

It is rare for the personal travails of one small-town lawyer to resonate so broadly. But Mr. Murdaugh, 53, was for years a well-connected player in the clubby South Carolina legal world; the family law firm, based in the tiny city of Hampton, has long been considered a powerhouse on the state plaintiff’s bar.

In recent weeks, a dizzying series of criminal investigations and civil lawsuits has emerged, accusing Mr. Murdaugh of betraying friends, colleagues and clients. The police have opened previously closed cases, including one involving the death of a former classmate of Mr. Murdaugh’s son and another involving a housekeeper who had long been thought to have fatally tripped and fallen on the front steps of the Murdaugh family’s home.

They are also looking at allegations that Mr. Murdaugh stole millions of dollars from his law firm and millions more from a settlement intended for the housekeeper’s children.

“Where does it stop?” said John P. Freeman, an emeritus professor of law and ethics at the University of South Carolina. “You can’t talk to anybody in South Carolina who isn’t talking about this case and is not just astonished by what’s going on.”

Mr. Murdaugh, through his lawyers, has insisted that he had nothing to do with the fatal shootings in June of his wife, Margaret, 52, and their younger son, Paul, 22, whose bodies he discovered on the family’s 1,700-acre hunting estate. Last month, however, he was arrested on charges related to the faked suicide attempt. Before admitting to the scheme, Mr. Murdaugh had claimed that a stranger shot him as he stopped to change a tire, with the bullet skidding through the top of his head.

On Sept. 16, he appeared in court before being released to await trial. His body was stooped, his trademark shock of red hair streaked with white. His lawyer, Richard A. Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator, said Mr. Murdaugh was checking into rehab for an oxycodone addiction

Mr. Smith was also released. He continues to insist he was not a collaborator, but a convenient scapegoat — collateral damage from a powerful man’s midlife skid out of control.

“I don’t know if betrayed is even the word for it,” Mr. Smith said recently, sitting on a love seat in his modest home outside of Walterboro, S.C. “I thought of him as a brother, you know, and loved him like a brother. And I would’ve done almost anything for him. Almost.”

**A name synonymous with power**

Despite a recent [influx of newcomers[(https://www.thestate.com/news/state/south-carolina/article248288360.html#:~:text=South%20Carolina%20was%202nd%20most,destination%20in%202020%2C%20study%20finds.&amp;text=The%20Palmetto%20State%20saw%20the,%2C%20with%2070%25%20inbound%20migration), South Carolina retains some of its old Southern insularity and traditions. It is a state where [old family names](https://lowcountrywalkingtours.com/charleston-stories/charleston-famous-families/) can still carry significant weight.

To some, the Murdaugh name has represented both power and public service. For nearly 90 years and across three generations, the post of chief prosecutor for five counties around Hampton was held by a Murdaugh. And for even longer, the law firm associated with the Murdaugh family has been one of the state’s leading tort litigation firms. Its Hampton headquarters, housed in a red-brick Colonial Revival building, is second in grandeur only to the nearby county courthouse.

To some here, the Murdaugh name has come to stand for a domination of the legal system so pervasive that people, with or without justification, asked whether it had the power to skew the trajectory of justice in the family’s favor.

That is one of the questions investigators are asking now as they examine not only the killing of Mr. Murdaugh’s wife and son, but at least three other deaths that preceded that tragedy.

How much, investigators have been trying to learn, did Alex Murdaugh wield his powerful connections to protect his family and amass his own fortune?

One of the cases now being re-examined is the death of Stephen Smith, 19, whose body was found on a rural road in 2015. He died of blunt force trauma to the head, but there were no signs to suggest that he had been hit by a car.

Mr. Smith had been a classmate of Alex Murdaugh’s older son, Richard Alexander Murdaugh Jr., who goes by Buster. The Smith family told the police that Alex Murdaugh’s brother, a partner in the Murdaugh law firm, had reached out and offered to represent the family for free, but it did not take him up on the offer. No connection to the Murdaugh family was ever identified, though investigators say they are now taking a fresh look.

The second case under scrutiny happened in 2019, when, witnesses said, Alex Murdaugh’s son Paul drunkenly crashed the family boat into a bridge, throwing several of his friends into the water. The body of one of them, Mallory Beach, 19, was found a week later.

A grand jury indicted Paul Murdaugh on a charge of boating under the influence causing death, but he was killed before he had an opportunity to stand trial.

Ms. Beach’s family is suing Mr. Murdaugh and the convenience store that sold an underage Paul the alcohol. Connor Cook, a lifelong friend of Paul’s who had also been on the boat, filed another lawsuit last month, accusing Mr. Murdaugh and others of trying to frame him for the boat crash. Mr. Cook said Mr. Murdaugh had told him to “keep his mouth shut” and to tell investigators that he did not know who was driving.

That lawsuit said Mr. Murdaugh had convinced Mr. Cook’s family to hire a lawyer named Cory Fleming, a friend and former college roommate of Alex Murdaugh’s, and Paul Murdaugh’s godfather.

After the killing of Alex Murdaugh’s wife and son, investigators began re-examining yet another mysterious death associated with the family: that of Gloria Satterfield, the housekeeper and nanny who had worked for a quarter-century for the Murdaugh family.

Early one morning in February 2018, Ms. Satterfield fell on the front stairs of the Murdaughs’ isolated house. Maggie Murdaugh found her bleeding and called 911, according to Eric Bland, a lawyer for Ms. Satterfield’s two adult sons. He said the Murdaughs told the family that she had tripped over their dogs.

Ms. Satterfield had lost most of her ability to speak, and died several weeks later.

Despite the Murdaugh family’s account, her death was ruled “natural” on her death certificate, the result of a brain bleed. No autopsy was done and the coroner was not contacted.

Hours after Ms. Satterfield’s funeral, her sons say, Mr. Murdaugh told them he would take responsibility and referred them to a lawyer who would help them file a lawsuit to force Mr. Murdaugh’s insurers to pay compensation.

The lawyer was again Mr. Murdaugh’s longtime friend, Mr. Fleming — who they later came to believe was not looking out for their interests, but Alex Murdaugh’s.

Mr. Fleming, the sons said in a subsequent lawsuit, advised them to sign over the management of their mother’s estate to an executive at a local bank where Mr. Murdaugh had done business.

Five months later, court records show, a judge approved a settlement agreement to pay the sons $2.8 million from Mr. Murdaugh’s insurers and award more than $1 million in lawyers’ fees. But the sons say they never heard about the deal.

It turned out that Mr. Fleming had sent the money to Mr. Murdaugh, according to copies of the checks and other documents recently filed in court by Mr. Bland.

The sons have yet to see any of it, Mr. Bland said.

Mr. Fleming said in a statement that Mr. Murdaugh had deceived him, too, and that he thought the sons would get the money. Last week, Mr. Fleming’s firm agreed to pay back all of the lawyers’ fees received from the settlement and its malpractice insurers agreed to pay the full policy limits to the sons.

But that was not the only money that seemed to be missing. Last month, Mr. Murdaugh’s colleagues at the law firm said they had discovered that he had siphoned millions of dollars out of the firm, and they asked him to resign. Mr. Murdaugh’s lawyers said he had spent vast sums of money on his addiction to oxycodone pills, but they have offered no explanation about where the rest of the money went.

**A meeting on a lonely road**

A day after the firm announced it was severing its relationship with Mr. Murdaugh, he and Mr. Smith ended up on the road outside of town, haggling, Mr. Smith says, over Mr. Murdaugh’s plan to exit from the mess his life had become.

Mr. Smith, who is now facing charges including assisted suicide, assault, insurance fraud and sale of methamphetamine, said he had no plans to participate in a scheme over insurance money. He said Mr. Murdaugh, who is a distant cousin, had called that morning and asked him to drive his work truck toward Hampton, never discussing why.

Soon, he said, Mr. Murdaugh drove by and honked his horn for Mr. Smith to follow him.

Outside of town, Mr. Murdaugh parked on the side of the road and Mr. Smith stopped nearby. When he got out of his truck, Mr. Murdaugh produced a gun and asked Mr. Smith to shoot him with it.

“It ain’t going to happen,” Mr. Smith said he told him. When Mr. Murdaugh moved as if he was going to shoot himself in the head, he said, Mr. Smith grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. The gun went off.

Mr. Murdaugh sank to the ground, Mr. Smith said, his hand over his head, his legs splayed.

Mr. Smith, left holding the gun, asked if Mr. Murdaugh was OK. Mr. Murdaugh indicated that he was.

The handyman swore at the lawyer, jumped back in his truck and drove away.

834,iamjensen1,[],1634152259,"### On April 10th, 1998, 40-year-old Diane Augat walked away from her sister's home in Hudson, FL. She would be spotted in the surrounding area over the next few days, but a couple of shocking discoveries would lead investigators to believe Diane had met foul play…

On Wednesday - April 15th, 1998 - 59-year-old Mildred Young heard a woman's voice over her answering machine. ""Help, help, help - let me out,"" the woman's voice said, clearly tense and alarmed by what was going on around her.

This was followed by a scuffling sound, which made it clear that someone on the other end of the phone was attempting to pull it away from the woman speaking. The woman on the other end could be heard saying ""Hey, gimme that!"" before the call came to a quick and unceremonious end.  

While most people wouldn't think twice of such a call, thinking it to be a malicious prank or a misdial of some sort - or, at the very least, a bizarre misunderstanding - Mildred Young knew better. After all, her daughter - a woman with diagnosed mental illness and a number of troubling personal relationships - had already been missing for several days. And the woman's voice from the other end of the phone was unmistakably her.  

This is the story of Diane Augat.

Diane Louise Young was born on February 21st, 1958, to her parents James and Mildred Young. While Diane grew up in New York, she would end up relocating to Florida, along with the rest of her family; specifically, in the area surrounding Tampa, which is where she began to plant her roots.  

In the late 1970s, Diane would marry Frederic Augat, taking on his surname. For a time, she seemed to live a pretty idyllic life, becoming a stay-at-home wife and taking care of the couple's three children (two daughters and a son); not only doting upon the children but making it a point of pride to keep a neat and orderly home.  

Denise, Diane's sister, would later recall:  

*""She had $100 pocketbooks. She was pretty. There could be 1,000 people in the room, and you'd notice her.""*

Unfortunately, in the late 1980s - after a brief period of bizarre behavior - Diane would be diagnosed with manic depressive disorder (which we know now as bipolar disorder). She would begin to treat this mental illness with medication, but over time, would begin to eschew treatment for a number of perceived reasons; none of which did her any good, and her mental health would begin to suffer as a result.  

In 1988, Diane was alleged to have committed child abuse by the state; alleged to have sought an excessive amount of unneeded treatment for one of her children (a mental illness we now know as Munchausen-by-proxy). While she would ultimately be acquitted of these charges, the state would continue to pursue a case against her, believing the charges to have had merit. Elaine Fulton-Jones, a spokeswoman for Children and Families, would later state about Diane and her three kids:

*""The children were removed from her custody.""*

In 1991, after a period of turbulent behavior, Diane and her longtime husband, Frederic, would divorce. He would retain custody of their children, and this would become the nail in the coffin (so to speak) for Diane's mental health.  

Over the next several years, Diane would begin to unravel (for lack of a better word), with her being in and out of not only local jails but mental health facilities. Her brother-in-law, Al Finklestein, would later recount to reporters in the Tampa area:

*""She's constantly talking to herself. You can tell right away she's ill.""*

And Diane's own mother, Mildred Young, would later recall:

*""She hangs out with whoever will be her friend. She's sick. You can't deal with her when she's as manic as she is. She gets in your face and doesn't shut up.""*

Diane would begin to develop a drinking problem during this period, and would also begin to dabble in drug use; both of which did nothing but exacerbate her already-existing mental issues. She would be involuntarily committed to mental health facilities at least 32 times under the Baker Act (which allowed a judge, police officer, or doctor to decide whether or not someone was mentally ill enough to pose a danger to themselves or others). The most recent of these involuntary committals came in 1998, which resulted in her being released to the care of her loved ones that Spring.  

However, according to Diane Augat's family members, she should never have been released. Her mother, Mildred Young, would tell the Tampa Bay Times that:  

*""She deeply needed institutionalized care.""*

On April 10th, 1998 - Good Friday - Diane Augat was seen alive by her family for the very last time.  

Diane had been released from a mental health facility roughly two weeks prior  - after being sent there for an involuntary evaluation - and had been staying with her sister in Hudson. While Diane had previously been living in Odessa (where she still had a home) her family thought it best for her to be with family for the time being.  

On the morning of April 10th, Diane was last seen by her sister, who ended up leaving for a doctor's appointment that morning. When she returned later that day, she found Diane missing from her home, and it would be reported that Diane left her sister's home - along Cobble Stone Drive in Hudson - at around 11:00 AM.  

Later that same day, Diane would be seen at the Hay Loft Tavern, located along Little Road and State Road 52. There, Diane stayed until she was kicked out, with Diane's mother, Mildred Young, later recounting to the Tampa Bay Times:  

*""\[The bartender\] cut her off because she was walking in circles. To my knowledge, that was the last anyone saw her, except for the one who took her.""*

Diane's family would report her missing the next day (April 11th).

While Diane had been known to disappear in the past, she generally only did so for a day or two. This was usually when she lapsed on her medication, or just simply stopped taking them. But in this case, Diane would go missing for several days, leading to the mysterious voicemail received by her mother on April 15th (five days later).  

While publications tend to vary on when, exactly, this call came in, it's most reputably reported to have been heard by Diane's mother on Wednesday, April 15th - five days after Diane's last known sighting. Other publications claim it was received on April 13th. In this call, Diane could be heard asking for help on the other end of the phone, but struggles to keep control of the phone from a mysterious individual taking it away from her.  

To Diane's loved ones, this call seemed to confirm that Diane was in serious trouble this time; especially since this was her longest, and most unusual, disappearing act yet. When Mildred would attempt to call back the number Diane had dialed her from, the name ""Starlight"" would appear on her caller ID (indicating that it had been a business with that name), but attempts to redial would go unanswered. In my digging, I've only found one business in the Tampa area with that name, a strip club named the Starlight Lounge (which is now known as Teasers). But it's unknown if there was any connection between the two.

There are two photos in the link, one showing a little girl wearing a pink shirt and another showing a little girl wearing the jean overall dress. If I’m understanding this correctly, the jean dress image is from a church vacation Bible school. But they have no clue who the girl is? They didn’t take any record of the kids’ names or emergency contact information? The child in the image is described as being very malnourished with an injured eye. Did no one contact child protective services? Why did it take 4 years for someone from the church to turn over these photos? Where is the picture in the pink shirt from? Why is that included?

This is the strange tale of the Carlingford Leprechaun and how it made one man into their whisperer. I apologise profusely if this has been mentioned before but I hope you find it as bizarre and interesting (and hopefully a little different) as I do.

So, Leprechauns (pronounced Leh pruh koan ) have been in many a children’s tale and often believed to reside at the end of a rainbow. They are known to be both magical and mardy and a staple of the Irish folk lore heritage.

The story takes place in the medieval town of Carlingford in County Louth. The town is an eclectic mixture of brightly painted terraced houses and medieval structures. It is 90km north of Dublin, close to the border, and was best known for its oysters, castles and harbour - until 1989. 

In 1989 Mr P J O’Hare (owner of the pub of the same name [PJ O Hare's Carlingford - Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PJ+O+Hare's+Carlingford/@54.0403785,-6.188354,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4860d6c61bce9a8d:0xc00648f4da31ff04!8m2!3d54.0403785!4d-6.1861653)) was gardening when he heard a scream nearby Foy Mountain in the Mourne Mountain Range. Troubled by hearing this he rushed to where he thought he heard the noise and was astonished when he came upon a patch of burnt earth and the remains of a tiny skeleton. The skeleton was surrounded by miniature green clothing, including a hat, and four gold coins. Mr O’Hare believed he had hit the proverbial jack pot and had found evidence of an actual leprechaun.

Mr O’Hare placed the tiny skeleton in a glass box in the pub that he owned ([image of the skeleton](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=xsoVVoTJ&amp;id=45F306F9FDA3CB36BF82AC2562DF37F916221EA3&amp;thid=OIP.xsoVVoTJnq1k-vaYoCGL_QHaHa&amp;mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ancient-origins.net%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fstyles%2flarge%2fpublic%2fCarlingford-Leprechaun-bones.jpg%3fitok%3ddaFn_aNG&amp;cdnurl=https%3a%2f%2fth.bing.com%2fth%2fid%2fR.c6ca155684c99ead64faf698a0218bfd%3frik%3dox4iFvk332IlrA%26pid%3dImgRaw%26r%3d0&amp;exph=610&amp;expw=610&amp;q=the+carlingford+leprechauns&amp;simid=608034092141726992&amp;FORM=IRPRST&amp;ck=97BCF2C5FFDBC60196530C200A9089C8&amp;selectedIndex=3)). However, despite the apparent confirmation of the existence of leprechauns, there were many in the town that failed to believe he had captured one. One such disbeliever was Kevin ‘McCoillte’ Woods who arranged a leprechaun hunt with five ceramic leprechauns and a £1000 Irish pounds under each one. McCoillte said that if people were hunting for these ceramics, in the same area O’Hare said he had found the ‘real’ leprechaun, then they would either find another or it would be proof that they did not exist at all. It is worth stating that this tradition has continued every May since, however, no further leprechauns have been found in any scorched earth by those who have taken part.

Nonetheless, despite his original disbelief and ridicule McCoillte was about to become a believer. After the death of O’Hare McCoillte was repairing a stone wall near his house where he found the gold coins that had gone missing from O’Hare’s pub (these had gone ‘missing’ when the pub was sold but the clothes and the skeleton remained). It was upon finding these that he began to have sightings of them. One day he was walking his dog and he said that he saw three leprechauns sitting on a rock. He said he watched them, transfixed for several minutes, however when he arrived home his wife was sick with worry. It transpired that he had been missing for seven hours. 

McCoillte continued to have sightings. In one particularly memorable meeting, McCoillte, said that he met with a leprechaun who said that his name was Carriag. Carriag informed him that he was the elder of 236 leprechauns but that there had once been millions of them in the mountains. When asked where they had all gone, Carriag simply said that they had died out due to people no longer believing in them.

This led to McCoillte campaigning for the protection of the mountain range. He, and the local community, were rewarded by the European Union, in 2009, as they passed a directive protecting the area. They argued that they could not prove, nor disprove, the existence of leprechauns. 

McCoillte continues to discuss the leprechauns and his visits with them. He was on the ‘This Morning’ show last year discussing how he visits them (allegedly an out of body experience) and that their wardrobe choices have been depicted incorrectly. They do not have a penchant for just green, in fact their preferred choice of jacket, is red.

As stated, earlier, the legend of the leprechaun is entrenched in Irish history. There are pictures dating back hundreds of years depicting the little men dressed in green and, in earlier folk tales, red. However, despite the stories from O’Hare and McCoillte there has been no effort to verify the authenticity of the remains found in 1989.

838,Nearby-Complaint,[],1634076902,"Sally Ann Hines, a fifty-eight-year-old Native woman and member of the Seaconke Wampanoag tribe, was reported missing by her husband out of San Antonio, Texas on December 14th, 2017, after he woke up and found her gone. After further investigation, it was found that Hines had left the house at 3AM that morning, wearing street clothes but no shoes. However, all of her important belongings, such as her purse, her medication, and her phone, were found to still be in the house. The medication in question was anti-rejection medication for a liver transplant that she had received six years prior, which could be lethal if untreated. The liver transplant in combination with struggles with her thyroid left Sally physically weakened, and she had trouble walking long distances. She also reportedly struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder and self-medicated with illicit drugs. Hines' relationship with her husband was said to be toxic, and relatives often tried to get Sally to distance herself from him. 

A few months later, in the middle of March of 2018, workers cleaning up trash in the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge off of Louisiana Highway 27 near Hackberry, made a grisly discovery: a badly decomposed human skull in a bag. Officers scanned the surrounding area for more evidence but were unable to find the rest of the person's remains. It was later determined that the head belonged to a white woman about 25-40 (though other sources stated 30-50), likely of Hispanic ancestry, who had 'extensive' dental work and auburn hair. Despite being separated from her body, the woman's head had no obvious trauma. Despite this, her death was considered suspicious in nature.  They determined that she had likely died about six weeks before being discovered. A forensic team at Louisiana State University created a DNA profile and charted the woman's dental records, neither of which received any hits. 

Meanwhile, authorities in San Antonio found no leads on Sally Hines' disappearance and the case quickly grew cold. Loved ones, including her husband and sister made pleas through the media for her to come back, though no evidence was found pointing to her whereabouts. 

In early 2019, the forensic team at Louisiana State created a reconstruction of the woman found in Sabine Wildlife Refuge, depicting a middle aged woman with wavy auburn hair and dark brown eyes. It was this reconstruction that lead to her identification. Two years later, the reconstruction caught the eye of a private citizen, who scrolled through dozens of missing persons profiles hoping to find a match. Though she was older than the unidentified woman, Sally Hines had an undeniable resemblance to the reconstruction, which prompted them to send in an anonymous tip. Investigators agreed with the tipster and retrieved Sally's dental records, which were a match to the unidentified woman in Louisiana. 

 Hackberry is almost three hundred and fifty miles (or five hundred and sixty-three kilometers) away from where Sally disappeared, and her health conditions made it almost impossible that she walked much of that.

Though no longer missing, the question remains: what happened to Sally Ann Hines?

840,B1Baker,[],1634074530,"**The Crime**

In the summer of 2019, a man only known as ""Mr. Poop"" defecated in public at least 10 times in Tokyo, Japan.  Some of these places were the outside of a restaurant, the entrance of an office building, the base of a utility pole, and the gap between two buildings.  

The authorities are confident that all of these crimes are the work of a single serial pooper from photographic evidence.  

**The Perpetrator**

 **T**he Perpetrator was seen fleeing one of the crime scenes with his pants down.  Mr. Poop is described as a man in his thirties, wore black pants, &amp; wore a blue backpack.

**Affect on Businesses** 

Businesses were affected by Mr. Poop, some even went so far as to put up signs to warn customers about Mr. Poop.

**What could Mr. Poop be charged with?**

Lawyer Hideo Yamada believes that it could be hard to charge Mr. Poop with a crime if he is caught.  Although all of the incidents happened on private property, the properties are frequently crossed by pedestrians, meaning that charging Mr. Poop for trespassing may not work.

However, If it's proven that Mr. Poop is a repeat offender, he could potentially be charged with disruption of business.

**Other serial Poopers**

Mr. Poop is just one of many unidentified serial poopers terrorizing cities &amp; neighborhoods, others include ""[The Bowel Movement Bandit](https://www.salon.com/2015/03/12/%E2%80%9Cthe_bowel_movement_bandit_is_creating_a_horrible_mess_for_akron_police/)"", ""[The Brown Bomber](https://brobible.com/life/article/brown-bomber-pool-pooper-new-zealand/)"", ""[The Mad Pooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mad_Pooper)"", &amp; ""[The Portland Pooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cUJ-GGfGCM)"" as just a few examples.

Despite an unstable early childhood and a move from Kentucky to Chicago to live with family members who would go on to adopt her and her brother, Yasmin was an excellent student and salutatorian of her 8th-grade class. But then, her grades began to slip and her brother was asked to leave the home, leaving Yasmin in a basement bedroom by herself and isolated from the rest of the family. 

**The day she disappeared.** On [January 15, 2008](https://uncovered.com/cases/yasmin-acree/timeline), Yasmin had a half-day of school and then went to her local YMCA. She returned home to do a load of laundry before bed. The next day, Yasmin's adoptive mother's boyfriend noticed that the locks on the basement were cut and that someone had burglarized the basement area of the home. Assuming Yasmin was at school, her family didn't report her missing until later that evening when she didn't return home from school.

**The investigation.** Initially, police wrote off the case and thought she was a runaway, but her family knew this wasn't the case. But unfortunately, little information led to any answers. Then, in 2011, two *Chicago Tribune* [reporters found a hidden diary](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2011-03-12-ct-met-yasmin-20110313-story.html) in Yasmin's room revealing that she had been friendly with a former tenant of the home, Jimmie Terrell Smith, who was arrested a year after her disappearance in connection with multiple rapes of girls ranging in age of 14 to 22.

I thought I would take a break from Kentish true crimes and branch into an unsolved mystery that is over 80 years old. I also know how discerning you readers are, and always in search of something not covered repeatedly, so for full disclosure I found this case covered in this subreddit four years ago, but nothing since.

**Case Summary-**

Ada Constance Kent was a spinster living in a cottage in Fingringhoe in Essex. It was the summer of 1939 and a month away from UK entering the second world war. The weather of that summer had been described as glorious, the young Princess Elizabeth first met Prince Phillip of Greece at a naval collage and terrible news reports of atrocities in Eastern Europe were heard on the radio. It was also when Ada would be reported missing.

A concerned friend reported her missing to the police after not seeing her around the village for a while. The friend entered her cottage and found remnants of a meal on a tray and an open copy of Romeo and Juliet resting on a chair near the fireplace. When the police also conducted a search of the property, they found nothing more than what was reported to them by the concerned friend. In the light of the burgeoning war efforts happening in the UK no further light was shed on where Ada could be.

In 1942, another concerned friend, George Winkal (the surname spelling has been documented a couple of ways), entered Ada’s cottage in pursuit of finding out what happened to her. Like the police, before him, he too found nothing awry or amiss. He said that he had to break in through the front door and searched all three rooms of the small cottage. To him it was like she had just “got up and vanished”. Again, the case went cold.

In 1948 a hefty sum of money was deposited into Ada’s bank account. Upon this occurring the bank tried, on various occasions, to reach Ada but to no avail, and as a result they contacted the police. This reinvigorated the police to search Ada’s cottage once again. When they entered the bedroom, they came upon a fully dressed skeleton that was placed next to the single bed. Next to the body was an empty bottle with the words poison printed on the label. 

The case received national press attention and an inquest was conducted in 1949. Nonetheless, suspicions arose that this might not be the body of Ada Constance. This could not be deduced from any DNA but rather that the body was much larger than hers and might also not have even been the body of a female. To this day the ‘real’ body of Ada has never been found nor an answer to what happened to her.

**More details of the case –**

**Ada Constance** 

Her name has been reported as Connie Kent and there is speculation that she could have been known as Vera Verchayle. Ada was a British actor that was not working at the time of her disappearance. Ada, although she can be found on the 1871 birth index, cannot be found on any census past this date. However, there is a Constance Kent documented in 1881 but this recorded a nine-year-old (she most likely would have been 10).  It also details that she lived with a Mary Ann Kent (aged 58) and Helen Ann Kent (34) which could well be her mother and grandmother. These three also appear in the 1891 census but Constance Kent appears in no further census. 

Ada was known to be an actress so it is not beyond the realm of possibility that she had been away travelling when the census was conducted. There was also a time when women in the suffragettes refused to be documented and as such this could have led to her name not coming up. However, by the summer of 1939, your name would have to be registered to ensure that you would receive a ration book, so it is unlikely that she was alive by this time.

**Last Movements-**

The last known sighting of Ada was on 6th March 1939 at the Whalebone pub, near her cottage, to buy her regular Woodbine cigarettes. This was confirmed by the landlord of the pub who noted that Ada looked ill and was seen coughing.  No other credible sighting was known to have occurred past this date and although she was somewhat of a revulsive character, she would still regularly be seen buying these.

**The 1949 Police Search-**

When the fully clothed skeleton was found the Police also noted that the property looked abandoned and dirty but not vandalised. They also discounted that a robbery had taken place as they had found jewels in some of the drawers. 

**The Inquest -**

A significant press attendance was at the cottage and the inquest due to the riveting details of the case. A man called Derek Edward Allen (21,), was called to testify, and noted he had been in the cottage numerous times, during the war. He had climbed through a window playing and he said that he had seen bones under the bed. However, he had felt at the time these were likely to be animal bones.

Furthermore, the medical examiner Dr Francis E Camps said that there were no injuries to the bones on the skeleton nor signs of any strangulation.  A further report from Scotland Yard reported that the bones looked too large to be that of Ada’s and could even be potentially male.

843,Newbosterone,[],1634047269,"tl;dr -  Béla Kiss killed  24, preserved the bodies, was thought killed in WWI, but later seen in Budapest and never caught.

From [Futility Closet:](https://www.futilitycloset.com/2013/09/17/a-parting-kiss/)

&gt;In December 1912 Hungarian tinsmith Béla Kiss told his neighbors that his wife had run off with another man. At the same time he began collecting large metal drums, telling the town constable that he planned to stockpile gasoline against the approaching war in Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;In November 1914 Kiss was drafted and left for the front, and in 1916 he was declared dead in combat. When soldiers visited the town that June in search of gasoline, the constable directed them to the dead man’s drums. On opening these they found that each contained not gasoline but the body of a nude woman, strangled and pickled in alcohol. A search of the house showed that Kiss had been luring women using newspaper advertisements in the name of Hoffmann, a “lonely widower seeking female companionship.”  
&gt;  
&gt;In the surrounding countryside authorities found 17 more drums, each containing a corpse. Among them were Kiss’ wife and her lover.  
&gt;  
&gt;It got worse. In 1919 Kiss was spotted near the Margaret Bridge in Budapest, and police discovered that the Béla Kiss who had been reported dead was in fact another man. In 1924 a deserter from the French Foreign Legion told of a legionnaire named Hoffmann who matched Kiss’ description and boasted of his skill with a garotte. But this Hoffmann himself deserted before police could apprehend him.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1932 New York detective Henry “Camera Eye” Oswald, who was renowned for remembering faces, insisted that he had seen Kiss emerge from the subway in Times Square, but crowds had prevented him from reaching him. Kiss was never apprehended, and his final fate is unknown.

844,lucSurMontaine,[],1634026590,"Almost 40 years ago in 1981, a caller alerted police to a ""decomposed"" body among some willow herbs in the North Yorkshire countryside, abruptly hanging up for ""reasons of national security"" when asked for a name and address. The body was in the location described, completely unclothed and unidentifiable, and the case gained notoriety as ""The Nude in the Nettles"" case. Full write-ups of the case in part I [here](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/interactive/nude-in-the-nettles-I) and part II [here.](https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/interactive/nude-in-the-nettles-II)

The body had been there for an estimated two years, and the only clue nearby was a yoghurt top beneath the body, dated 1979. A bra, evening gown and pants were found about a mile from the body not long afterwards but they could not be linked to the deceased.

Police believe that the woman was killed and dumped in the countryside, but still lack evidence to determine a cause of death - meaning the case is merely labelled ""suspicious"" even today.

Analysis of the body revealed a few details: the woman was a mother, had a malformation on her spine, and was between 35-40 when she died. In spite of extensive efforts to trace the caller, he was never located or identified.

Appeals were made nationally and internationally to discover the woman's identity, but all were fruitless and the case was shelved.

Early theories - that she was an escaped prisoner, that she was a missing secretary from Hull - were all revealed to be incorrect.

In 2012, the North Yorkshire Police cold case team successfully managed to extract a full DNA profile from the mystery woman, believing they had located her children.

When compared, however, the profiles did not match. The woman's DNA was added to the national database, but as yet, no new matches have ever cropped up.

Police have not yet given up the hunt for answers, however, and hope that new forensic techniques - as well as targeting of genealogists - might finally lend a name to the woman's unmarked grave.","The ""Nude in the Nettles"" victim was discovered dead - likely killed - in a rural North Yorkshire location close to 40 years ago. In spite of evidence showing she had between 2-3 children and a full DNA profile being pulled, police still have no idea who she was."
845,premeddit,[],1634010596,"*""There is absolutely no denying the sinister atmosphere of that whole valley. The weird, continual wailing of the wind is something I won’t, soon forget.""* - Frank Henderson, Canadian geologist, 1946

These past two summers, the pandemic forced many of us disconnect from our urban living and check out more rural attractions. National parks saw their visits increase to record high levels from tourists wishing to escape the crowded cities. And while most national parks are wonderful places to visit and take in nature, there's definitely one you *don't* want to explore... Nahanni National Park.

Nahanni National Park Reserve is located in the cold distant Northwest Territories region of Canada. The park was among the world's first four natural heritage locations to be inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1978 because of its picturesque wild rivers, canyons, and waterfalls. But there is a darker and sinister aspect to this land that has been long whispered by both native and Western inhabitants for centuries. Let's dive in.

Our story begins thousands of years ago.  The Dene are the most well known traditional native inhabitants of the area, claiming the land from ancient times. But curiously, their oral history contains many references to a ""Naha"" tribe, a mountain-dwelling people who used to viciously raid settlements in the adjacent lowlands. When the Dene in the valley finally decided to strike back at their Naha rivals, they sent scouts to find the Naha settlement in the mountains of current Nahanni National Park Reserve. Then they fetched their warriors and then lay in wait until nightfall, preparing their attack. In the middle of the night they surrounded the Naha settlement on all sides, sneaking closer and ready to strike. Once they were right alongside the teepees, they hurriedly threw open the tent flaps, weapons at the ready and…no one was inside. Silence. Fires were smoldering, sleeping bags were laid out, but there wasn’t a single human around. They had disappeared completely. (**Fun fact:** At about the same time as the Naha reportedly vanished, the Navajo oral histories began thousands of miles away. Present day similarities between local Dene dialects and Navajo language in the southern United States has led to speculation that the Navajo are descendants of the missing Naha.)

Over the centuries, Europeans settled nearby and in the 1800s/1900s the park began to gain some interest for potential reserves of gold. Many of these explorations ended up in mysterious disappearances or deaths. The most famous story is of two brothers Frank and Willie McLeod in 1904. Traveling with primitive gear, they traversed hundreds of kilometers by train, boat, and foot during a numbingly cold winter until they reached Gold Creek. Their efforts were rewarded that year and they returned to their home in Fort Liard with gold in hand. However, not satisfied, the brothers made a second expedition into the Nahanni range in 1905. They never returned. Three years later, their younger brother Charlie McLeod led a search in the park in 1908, where he discovered two skeletons at their camp on the river’s edge in a vast valley. Their heads had been severed and one man lay with his arm outstretched towards his gun, the blankets were thrown across his brother as if he had leaped suddenly from the bed, read reports. From that day forward, the valley has been known as Deadmen Valley, and the creek called Headless Creek.

It wasn’t just the McLeod brothers who died or went missing in the park in the early 20th century. A Scottish engineer had been traveling with them and was never seen again, and Yukon prospector Martin Jorgensen met a similar fate in 1917. He had sent news home that he had “struck it rich” in the area. Not long after, his decapitated skeleton was found outside his cabin, which had been burned to the ground, spawning rumors of “head-hunters” in the valley in Canadian newspapers.

In 1946 Calgary geologist and mining expert Frank M. W. Henderson returned from the valley reporting his partner Jack Patterson had disappeared. Henderson and Patterson had agreed to meet at a point near Virginia Falls. The first to arrive would leave a message on a large tree which both knew from previous trips. Henderson arrived first and left his message before traveling into the valley. He returned several weeks later only to find there was still no message left by Patterson. Henderson and his party camped there a few days, but one night were awoken by a group of First Nations people who warned of white figures moving along the valley. Frightened, Henderson never returned to the park again.

Numerous other reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed similar deaths and disappearances. Around the same time in the park’s history, a series of unexplained plane crashes earned an expanse of mountains named the Funeral Range, which borders the ominous Hell’s Gate rapids.

Why is Nahanni National Park's history stained with so much blood and dark mystery? Is it is unforgiving location in the deepest regions of north Canada, a place that is naturally more dangerous for humans? Is it the steepness of the valleys and the raging tides of the rivers? Is there something to the old Dene stories of vengeful tribal spirits and giants that supposedly still roam the forests? It will likely forever be a mystery, but one thing is for sure - if you go, make certain that you are prepared for whatever you may encounter.

*Hello! Years and years ago, I wrote a pretty extensive write-up on the West Memphis Three for this sub. Since then, I have deleted and moved several accounts and while they are still accessible on this sub, they are harder to find. I thought it might be a good idea to repost these to make it easier for people to read or re-read the write-ups. The writing has been cleaned up a bit but other than that, the series should have largely the same content it did when it was first posted.*

**Case Overview:** For case newbies and those who roll their eyes at true crime documentaries, the [West Memphis Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis_Three) refers to the now infamous deaths of Chris Byers, Stevie Branch, and Michael Moore, three eight year old boys. Three local teens were eventually tried and convicted for the crime in 1994. This has proven to be.... *contentious* to say the least. You can find a huge amount of believers in the convict’s innocence, including celebrities like Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder. A quick search on this forum or Google will turn up an equal amount of people who steadfastly believe they’re guilty. This seems to matter little now because in 2011, the three teenagers turned men were offered the Alford plea and released. This plea allowed them to maintain their innocence while acknowledging that the state had enough evidence to convict. Throw in sketchy police work, a mysterious man wandering through fast food restaurants, a trial laced with Satan and tales of cults with blackened faces and you have a complex, confusing monster of a case.

**Stevie, Chris and Michael’s Day**

With all the hoopla, controversy, and just plain weirdness of the case, it can be easy to forget that three children were brutally murdered on May 5th, 1993. People described the boys as happy youngsters, who were best friends and did everything together. They loved playing outside and being in Cub Scouts. Chris was a bundle of energy, while Stevie still [believed](https://web.archive.org/web/20130522225152/http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/1993/may/09/pain-tells-how-much-life-3-slain-boys-had) in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. Michael wore his Cub Scout uniform almost every-day and liked to bring various [odds and ends](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/becky_miller_notes.html) he found to school. All three children were tragically found dead in a drainage ditch on May 6th 1993, after being reported missing in the evening hours of May 5th.

*Sightings of the Victims:*

Like everything else in this case, they’re… suspect. Popular conception of the case is that the children rode their bicycles to Robin Hood Hills. The killers then murdered the boys about a quarter mile away in the Blue Beacon Woods. Actual testimony paints a different story.

On the day of May 5th, the three victims were bicycling all over their neighborhoods after school. Stevie Branch wore a white T-shirt and blue jeans, while Chris was wearing a long-sleeved white shirt. He had dark shoes on and he carried a skateboard, instead of a bike. Michael had his beloved Boy Scout uniform on, complete with a hat and blue pants. Stevie’s bike was red and black, while Michael’s was a light greenish color. The police recovered the bicycles after the crime and there is conflicting accounts about the skateboard. John Mark Byers claimed that it was [found ](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/jmb1.html)near Dana Moore’s house, while in trial, Chris Byer’s brother told the jury that the skateboard he [found ](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/rclark.html)was one he had never seen before. No skateboard was ever admitted into evidence.

There is an extremely wide gap between sightings of the three victims. They were placed in multiple different areas from 5:00 to 6:45 from both family and people in the town.

*Stevie Branch:*

Pam Hobbs would not be informed of her sons disappearance until 9:30 at night, since she started her work shift at 5 pm. In a 2007 interview, she [said](http://callahan.mysite.com/pdf/pam_hobbs_interview.pdf) she saw Stevie last at 3:30 pm, leaving on his bike with Michael. She did not see him again the rest of the evening. In a 2007 interview, Terry Hobbs, his stepfather, [claimed](http://callahan.mysite.com/pdf/t_hobbs_interview.pdf) that he did not see Stevie at all that night.

*Chris Byers:*

Ryan Clark, his brother, [testified](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/ryanclark.html) that he did not see Chris before leaving to be a witness in a court case at 4 pm. In 2007, Pam Hobbs said in her interview that Chris came over around 3:30 and asked to play with Stevie. He apparently watched a TV show at her home until 4 pm. Mark Byers saw Chris shortly after 5:20, when he left to pick up his other son from court. Byers said that Chris was skateboarding on the street and that he hit him with a belt buckle as a punishment, before telling Chris to clean up the carport. Melissa Byers, his mom, last [saw](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/melb1.html) Chris under the carport at 5:30 pm after arriving home from work.

*Michael Moore:*

Pam Hobbs saw Michael leave with Stevie on a bike at 3:30 pm. His mother, Dana Moore saw him last at 6 pm, heading towards Robin Hood Hills. She [claimed](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/danam.html) in her witness statement to have seen all three of the boys, with Chris climbing on Michael’s bike. Michael’s sister, Dawn, raced after Michael to bring him back but did not catch up to the three kids. She [told](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/dawnm.html) the police that she had seen three teenagers, one white and two black, exiting the woods around this time. They apparently tried to sell drugs to her before moving on their way.

*Other Sightings of the Victims:*

Three non-family members were called to testify in trial: Narlene Hollingsworth, Bryan Woody and Debra O’Tinger. O’Tinger gave a [statement](http://callahan.mysite.com/images/debra_otinger_handwritten.JPG) to the police at the end of June, claiming to have seen the children in front of her yard at 5:30 pm. They had left before she backed out of the driveway at 6 pm on her way to a dinner appointment. In trial, she said that two of the boys, one on a bicycle, were in front of her driveway at 6 pm. She [remembered ](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/doting.html)them because she had to wait in her truck to leave for her appointment. One of the children she could identify as Chris Byers.

Bryan Woody was the other major witness, and he's one that [placed the kids](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/ebtrial/bwoody.html) most firmly in the Robin Hood woods sometime between 6:30 and 6:45 pm. His neighbors backed him up and said they observed the three victims heading towards Robin Hood Hills around 6:30 pm. They changed the number to four boys in a statement given in September.

Woody's sighting has several different problems. For one thing, he claims to have seen *four* children. The other bigger issue is that he had limited time to see the victims due to crossing at an intersection at 40 miles per hour. As [jivepuppi](https://www.jivepuppi.com/jivepuppi_last_seen.html) puts it, “He would only have been able to see the children when he was crossing the intersection of 14th and Goodwin. Traveling at 40-45 mph, his car would move 59 to 66 feet in one second. Heading to 1823 Goodwin, he would have had to have seen these kids out of his driver's side window, for a maximum of less than one second and it would only be the maximum amount of time if for some reason he was speeding down Goodwin looking out of his window.""

Woody was not able to identify any of the victims by name, and said he thought the kids may have been the victims, because one sported a similar spiky hair style to Stevie Branch. This was attacked by the defense at trial.

&gt;Wadley: On any given day. Uh - you recognized the - the one boy that had a spiked - spiked hair, is that correct?  
Woody: Yes.  
Wadley: And I believe you told me - testified that you son -  
Woody: - Yes.  
Wadley: - Wore that hairstyle?  
Woody: Well, he's alot younger, but it just stuck up on it's own.  
Wadley: During that time were there a lot of children that you saw out there that wore that type of - that type of hair?  
Woody: Yeah, there's -  
Wadley: Mr. Woody, how long did you have a chance to observe these four boys?  
Woody: About 5 seconds.  
Wadley: 5 se -  
Woody: - Yeah, I was doing about 45, I'm not gonna lie.  
Wadley: So you looked at them for about 5 seconds?

Narlene Hollingsworth, an important figure to this case, also gave a statement that she saw the victims, something that will be analyzed later in the Hollingsworth section.

In addition to the ones that testified at trial, other witnesses gave statements, and identified the boys by name in door to door sightings prior to the arrest. One person [saw](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/b_crafton_door.html) Branch and Moore on their bikes at 6 pm, but did not see Byers with them. They also identified another witness, Kim Williams, who they said was with the boys at this time. Kim Williams [claimed](http://callahan.mysite.com/images2/k_williams_report.JPG) to have seen Branch and Moore go into Robin Hood Hills (about a quarter mile away from the crime scene and a different area than the first witness), sometime between 5:30 and 6 pm.

Kim said that Branch and Moore left their bicycles at Goodwin. She also saw three teenagers around the woods area, two black and one white, echoing Dawn Moore’s statements.

[Two](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/o_bailey_statement.html) [members](http://callahan.mysite.com/images2/bailey_otto_sr_report.jpg) of the same family saw Branch and Moore in a slightly different place at 6pm, heading towards Mayfair Apartments on WE Catt Street, which is near the crime scene. They did tell the police that the victims were carrying green backpacks, none of which were found at the crime scene.

Another [witness](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/img/c_wahl_notes.html) placed Chris Byers well away from the woods at 7 pm, describing him as bicycling with a blonde kid. This person knew Chris Byers but did get the descriptions of the bicycles wrong. A friend of Chris claimed that he stopped by after getting whipped but did not specify the time.

The only [witness](http://callahan.mysite.com/images2/c_rico/rico_c_notes.jpg) that saw the three kids on the north and east of the pipe bridge, near where the interstate crosses the bayou, was Cynthia Rico. She saw them sometime between 6 and 6:30 pm. This conflicted with other witness statements but she did know there were only two bikes.

This [photo](https://www.jivepuppi.com/images/00neighborhoodlastdoor.jpg) helpfully compiles all the major sightings collected prior to the arrest of Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley.

What we basically have is no one credible with the exception of Cindy Rico is really able to place the boys in the Blue Beacon woods. At most you have testimony that they appeared to be headed there, either on WE Catt Street towards the crime scene or in the direction of Robin Hood Hills. What’s also interesting is most of the witnesses actually place Chris *away* from the other two at the crucial 6’o clock hour (generally accepted to be the time that the boys went missing), including his own father who saw Chris playing on the street alone a couple of houses away and his mother who placed him in the carport at around 5:30 pm. The credibility of the witness who saw Chris at 7 pm is questionable, due to not identifying his bike correctly, but it’s bolstered by four fairly believable witnesses who all saw Stevie and Michael together

**The Time of Death:**

Well... no one really knows. The general agreement in recent years is that the boys were killed sometime between 6 and 9, a time that was very convenient for the prosecution. It was also a time that proved to be very hard for multiple residents of West Memphis to find alibis for.

The medical examiner originally testified that the time of death [occurred](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/ebtrial/frankp.html) from 1 am to 5 am in the morning. The prosecution told the judge all agog that he had sprung this on them without telling them beforehand. They brought another witness to disprove Peretti’s original estimate, named Dr. Duke Jennings, who was a local pathologist. He [alleged](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/ebtrial/djennings.html) that Peretti had only taken into account the lividity of the bodies, citing other factors like temperature, bleeding and position. Some of his findings are disputed by sites such as [Jivepuppi](https://www.jivepuppi.com/a_twilight_kill_part_ten.html), which claim that Peretti did take into account temperature and consulted with other experts. However, another expert consulting with Ron Lax, named Chris Sperry estimated the time of death at around roughly 8:30 and also said he believed Peretti did not take into account the temperature.

Guessing the time of death is an extremely subjective piece of science, and the original medical examiner admitted that he wasn’t all that sure. It seems most probable that the boys were indeed murdered in the evening hours, but the timeline would have to be pretty tight, since the boys last whereabouts happened to be at 6:30 and searchers helping the parents (the Search and Rescue team did not start until the next morning) began to flood the woods at some-time around 8 and 9 pm that night.

**The Crime Scene:**

A picture of the Crime Scene can be found [here](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fthewm3revelations.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2Fdiscovery_woods_and_blue_beacon_looking_south.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fthewm3revelations.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2F07%2Fcrime-scene-or-dump-site%2F&amp;docid=I74E8xuRZfpYJM&amp;tbnid=HmlIg_Hr-GFeYM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=630&amp;h=479&amp;client=safari&amp;bih=679&amp;biw=1220&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBw8_-vP_bAhW8HTQIHbe-BuYQMwjIASgqMCo&amp;iact=c&amp;ictx=1) (angle is from the north). On the west side of Blue Beacon Woods is the Blue Beacon Truck Wash, well-lit at night, and stocked with two employees. A little further to the west is the 76 Truck Stop. No one who worked at the wash reported anything unusual there when interviewed as a group. On the east is a field and further east is the Robin Hood Hills area. North of the crime scene is a service road running parallel to the interstate. To get to the crime scene, the children probably would have had to cross a [pipe](https://thewm3revelations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/devils-den.jpg) over the Bayou waters. The bicycles were found in the Bayou near the pipe and the Mayfair apartments on the other side.

This was a popular spot for children to play and for parents to forbid their kids from entering, called something of a “paradise” by the prosecution, who pointed out the numerous creeks and woods. Chris hid his muddy shoes from his mom and denied going there, while numerous kids testified to having played in Robin Hood Hills, all while saying that they didn’t do it anymore. One witness [claimed](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/img/rmcdermottnotes.html) that they never saw any adults in the area. Numerous strange sightings of teenagers loitering about the woods both prior to and at the time of the murders will be discussed later.

There were [multiple](https://www.google.com/search?q=trails+to+blue+beacon+woods&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6_f6mvf_bAhXH-lQKHbdEAEcQ_AUIDCgD&amp;biw=1220&amp;bih=679#imgrc=ePHxgcpgXR0fDM:) trails to the discovery site, in addition to across the pipe. [Two](https://thewm3revelations.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/crime_scene_drawing.jpg) of them are on the side of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash, with one going directly from the 76 Truck Stop. It is also possible to access the discovery spot from the field on the east. There are no trails directly from the Interstate or the service road though there is one near [it](https://thewm3revelations.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/e_wallofwoods1.jpg).

The WMPD found the boys in a drainage ditch, an off-shoot of the Bayou located in Blue Beacon Woods. The ditch was about 2½ feet deep at the time of discovery, and filled with slow-moving, tepid water. They kids were all tied right ankle to right wrist, and left ankle to left wrist instead of the more traditional hog-tie. Moore’s body was found 27 feet north of Branch’s and Byers bodies, which were five feet apart.

One contentious part of the crime scene was the “slicked off bank” right in front of where Moore’s body was found. The prosecution alleged it was cleaned up, by pointing out scuff marks, swirl patterns, and the absence of leaves. The defense claimed that the pictures were too dark to see this, and later supporters have pointed out that the other banks looked similar to the one found above Moore.

**Evidence Collected:**

And here’s where the crime starts to get *weird.* In addition to finding the boys bodies, the WMPD also retrieved clothing jammed down by sticks, after draining the ditch and performing a grid search. Sticks at the crime scene, including one with a piece of a shirt on it, were not delivered into evidence until two months later. Odd details abound. Five socks and two pairs of underwear were missing. The police did manage to locate all three of boys pants, two of which were inside out and buttoned. A blue and yellow Cub Scout cap was found, though Michael’s was described as blue and orange. The shirts found however, did not match what the boys were supposed to be wearing. Both Chris and Stevie were wearing white long sleeved shirts that day, while one shirt recovered had surf-board designs and another had black and white polka-dots (possibly an undershirt). Michael's Cub Scout shirt was the only shirt found at the crime scene that matched what he was supposed to be wearing.

The clothes were devoid of blood and showed little sign of struggle, meaning that the boys either undressed themselves or were stripped by the killers before they were attacked and tied. One of the victims pants had a stain on them. It may or may not have been semen. Initial witnesses for the prosecution hinted towards this, but later experts claimed that there was no way to know for sure what sort of DNA was on the pants, since the water and mud had corroded the sample. If it was semen, this does match up with one of Jessie’s later confessions, in which he claimed that Damien jacked off and wiped it on the pants.

Michael Moore was apparently clutching the fibers of a blanket in his hand. Why or where that blanket came from has never been determined, thought it was brought up in trial.

Other pieces of evidence found at the crime scene but not connected to the crime itself was a plastic pill bottle with cigarette butts, a bag with clothing and two razors, a cotton rope, and knives that were not found in the immediate crime scene but were located in same ditch as the victim’s bodies. A screwdriver was found jammed in the mud, sticking straight up, near the clothes. Various other pieces of garbage were also found but it was determined that they were disposed of prior to the murder.

Hairs and fibers were also found at the crime scene, something I’ll go into greater detail later on.

**Were They Killed at the Crime Scene?**

This was an early debate among the prosecution and the defense. If they were not killed at the crime scene, then the culpability of the three teenagers was seriously suspect. None of the convicted had access to cars.

Not one trace of blood was found at the crime scene itself but Luminol tests were taken. According to the report, the [Luminol ](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/luminol_dsmith.html)findings proved that the boys had been murdered where their bodies were found. Luminol can be very unreliable due to lighting up at other properties besides blood like iron and feces, and a different Luminol test in the soil turned up [inconclusive](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/luminol.html). The luminol was not allowed into evidence at trial, due to the tests being uncorroborated.

The motive for bringing the boys to the crime scene makes little sense, since the person would run a great risk of being seen transporting them. Two of the three boys were officially determined to have drowned to death, though the medical examiner claimed that the head wounds sustained were enough to kill them. This means that they must have been submerged in some sort of water quickly after sustaining the wounds. While the boys were never determined to have drowned in the drainage ditch, I wonder where else the perpetrator could have done it.

The last sightings placed the victims either entering Robin Hood Hills or going down WE Catt Street towards the Bayou, which means that the person would have had to enter the wood with them, take them elsewhere, and then take the kids *back* to the woods.

However, some oddities, like found clothing not matching what the victims were wearing, lack of mosquito bites on the victims, and missing underwear do leave lingering questions. Officer Regenia Meek [said](http://callahan.mysite.com/wm3/ebtrial/rmeek.html) that she went to the woods that night and breathed in a swarm of mosquitos so thick she could barely breathe. The side of the woods through the meadow on the east was also traversable by car.

The prosecution alleged that the area was “cleaned” of the blood, explaining the lack of it. It is also true that mosquito bites take time to develop, and may not be visible on a dead body if the inflammation process does not have the time.

*The Man Hole Theory*

There were several manholes around the area of Robin Hood Hills and there’s absolutely no blood on the crime scene and the kids were drowned. Bingo! Amateur researchers on WM3 message boards began to speculate that perhaps the boys had been killed in one and transported to the ditch nearby to stage the scene.

There’s actually some solid reasoning to it too. No one was seen at the crime scene despite there being intense searching through most of the evening hours. Bruises on the boy’s bodies look like they may have been caused by the rebar rungs of a hole. The perpetrator could have murdered the boys there, drowned them, waited for the searching to subside later in the night, transported the boys, and removed them to the crime scene.

*Some Problems with This Theory*

1. The perpetrator would have to remove each boy one by one, risking being seen that night.
2. There are no significant injuries to the shoulders or arms suggesting that they had been carried a distance.
3. One of the main manholes in the area was extremely deep and dark, meaning that the person would have needed a light and would have had a hard time carrying the boys out of there.
4. There’s then the question of why the perpetrator wouldn’t just leave the kids in the manhole instead of transporting them to a drainage ditch. Did they want the kids to be found? Did they think that a maintenance man would stumble upon the kids in the manhole? Did they want to blame passing transients or truckers? Why would they choose the ditch and not the deeper Bayou?",The West Memphis Three: A Comprehensive Overview [repost]
847,Bluest_waters,[],1634002774,"One of the reasons I have been very skeptical of the claims that Poste is Zodiac is that the 'Case Breaker' guys are adamant that Cherie Jo Bates was a Zodiac victim, something most investigators don't agree with. 

Here they detail how they actually found the original writer of the '67 letter ""confessing"" to the Bates murder and that it was just a terrible prank. That letter was used to link the Bates murder to Zodiac.

https://www.ketk.com/news/national/zodiac-killer-police-refute-investigators-claims-they-found-the-serial-murderer/

SAN FRANCISCO (NEXSTAR) – A team of investigators calling themselves The Case Breakers say they know the identity of the Zodiac Killer, but law enforcement is refuting their claim.

The serial murderer killed five people in Northern California in 1968 and 1969, taunting investigators with with a series of cryptic notes.

The Case Breakers, a group of 40-plus members led by retired FBI agents have varied backgrounds in law enforcement, according to their site, and work to solve some of the country’s most notorious cold cases. The Case Breakers have previously attempted to tackle the D.B. Cooper case and the death of Jimmy Hoffa, according to FOX.

The self-described task force identified an Air Force veteran who lived near Northern California’s Sierra Nevada as the Zodiac Killer in a story first reported by FOX News on Wednesday. The man they named died in 2018. (Nexstar is opting not to name the man in The Code Breakers’ report in light of refutation from law enforcement).

The group said they also believe the Air Force veteran is responsible for killing a sixth victim, 18-year-old Cheri Jo Bates on Oct. 31, 1966 in Riverside, California and stated that detectives recovered “hairs, skin and blood” from under her fingernails. They are calling on the department to test the alleged evidence – which they say is stored in the Northern California city of Vallejo – against that of the person they identified in the case.

Riverside Police Officer Ryan Railsback told Nexstar that his department is unaware of any such physical evidence and questioned where the cold case team was getting its information. Railsback said that Riverside investigators have worked closely with the labs and law enforcement teams to investigate any possible link.

“**If the Cheri Jo Bates case was actually related to the Zodiac Killer, we wouldn’t be holding that back, especially 55 years later,” Railsback said. “Unequivocally, we are saying that the Cheri Jo Bates case and the Zodiac Killer case are not related**.”

Railsback said that the Riverside Police Department’s Cold Case Unit did receive a handwritten letter in 1967 that initially led investigators to believe the Zodiac Killer might have been behind her murder. The department received a second letter, this time typed, apologizing for the letter and saying it was written as a “sick joke.”

In 2020, the Riverside Cold Case Unit and the FBI Los Angeles Investigative Genealogy Team used DNA evidence from the stamp on the 2016 letter to track down the author and confirm that he wrote both letters. The letter writer, who was a teenager in 1967, wasn’t involved in the murder of Bates, investigators determined.

San Francisco police and the FBI also cast doubt on the Case Breakers’ announcement to the San Francisco Chronicle. “The Zodiac killer case remains open. We have no new information to share at the moment,” the FBI told the newspaper Wednesday.",Zodiac Killer: Police refute investigators’ claims they found the serial murderer [Gary Francis Poste]
848,fvinic,[],1633996541,"Fábio Abraão Jorge de Araújo was an active boy, but everything changed in July 2020, when he ate a donated lunch box. Inside was a poison used to kill rats, a kind of poison that is prohibited in Brazil. The boy, then 11 years old, was taken in serious condition to hospital. The poisoning caused Fábio's cerebral palsy. He doesn't talk, he doesn't walk and he has difficulty eating.  ITAPEVI, SÃO PAULO - BRAZIL

\- Two other homeless people and their dog who ate the lunchboxes died. Another teenage girl was hospitalized and survived.

The poisoned lunch box that Fábio had eaten  was a gift from a friend of his father, a homeless man, who received five lunch boxes from church volunteers and died shortly after eating it. ""That day, my friend, who is homeless, received three lunchboxes from the church. He took them for us. My son, my girlfriend and I were at home. I only ate the meat and the food was delicious. My girlfriend ate and passed it on bad, she had to be hospitalized for 15 days. My son, on the other hand, got worse,"" he recalls.

\- The woman who prepared lunchboxes has been working for 10 years as a volunteer at a well-known institution in the region where the case took place, she reported to the police that her family consumed the same food on the date of the occurrence, but no one had any adverse symptoms. Other people who worked on preparing the meals, also ate from the lunchbox. However, no one was sick. 

\- The moment the food was donated at the abandoned gas station was recorded by a surveillance camera. According to the information given to the police, the woman said that she decided to go to the authorities after recognizing her car in the images of a security circuit that were released by the press. In addition, she also informed the agents that she identified the lunchboxes that she herself would have prepared. 

\- In the expert analysis report, no toxic substances were found and the Church's kitchen was considered a safe environment for the preparation of meals.

\- According to the boy's father, there is a suspect woman, but she hasn't been arrested yet. ""The lawyer asked for her temporary detention and so far nothing has been done,"" says his father.

\- The police even worked out the possibility of revenge, as one of the fatal victims would have been involved in a fight days earlier with an as-yet-unidentified individual.

\- According to police, the lunchboxes were poisoned after being handed over to the victims.  


The info above was everything I could find on the news, the police said that they interviewed about 30 people, but it does not seen that much effort was put in the case. The most common theory is that someone poisoned the lunch boxes after it being handed over to the homeless mans and that they were the targets.

849,typhoidsergei,[],1633986180,"Stephen and Jenny Sun-Reisberg were a newlywed couple who resided in Cambridge at the time of their disappearance. While vacationing on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, they disappeared during a hiking trip at Kokee State Park sometime in early to mid-September of 1990. They were not reported missing until September 24 by a professor at Harvard University, where Jenny was a doctoral candidate.

Although the Reisbergs been scheduled to return home on September 9, they had a history of changing travel plans, and a museum employee at Kokee State Park, Mark Jeffers, told authorities he talked to them sometime after September 9. Jeffers is the last known person to have seen them, when the Reisbergs consulted him about hiking the nearby Mount Waialeale, one of the wettest spots on earth. Jeffers stated the Reisbergs viewed maps of Mount Waialeale for nearly an hour and were excited and determined to hike the area and visit the summit of the island. Although the Reisbergs were experienced hikers, Jeffers had tried to dissuade them against hiking Mount Waialeale, as it has few trails and is considered to be quite difficult to climb. This was the last known sighting of the Reisbergs.

Two weeks after the Reisbergs' disappearance, their rental car was located at the Pu O Kila lookout within Kokee State Park. The vehicle contained the couple's fully packed backpacks, tents, suitcases, snacks, and a half-full container of juice. No signs of struggle could be seen in or around the vehicle.

An extensive search from September 27-30 only located a scarf similar to one in Jenny's luggage, although it is unclear if this scarf belonged to her. In addition, a hiker had told investigators that he heard a woman moaning in the park, but it is unknown if this woman was in fact Jenny.

The area the Reisbergs were last seen in has marijuana plantations nearby, and two hikers were killed by growers at one of these plantations in 1990, the same year as the Reisbergs' disappearance.

Another theory, albeit rooted in rumors, postulates that the Reisbergs had staged their disappearance, as Jenny had reportedly told an associate that Stephen was uninterested in his profession.

A memorial service was held for the couple sometime later in 1990. No trace of them has ever been located.

851,molseed,[],1633967997,"The body of Ryan ""Rae"" Benjamin was found in a pond in Pottstown, PA in 2016. She had been tied to a cinder block, did not show any signs of blunt force trauma or gunshot wounds, and an autopsy found that she had not drowned (she was dead before she was put in the pond). Toxicology reports have not been made public.

Rae was a classmate of mine in college. We weren't friends, but I remember her kind and funny personality in a theater class we had together. News of her death shocked our small college community, and the fact that it is still unsolved just hurts. Recently some of my former classmates have been sharing her story again and contrasting it with the Gabby Petito case, which of course received nationwide attention. Rae mattered, too. What happened to her? Sometimes I wonder whether the police are even still investigating.

#So, what is a RedditTalk?#

[Reddit Talk](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391875/reddit-talk-clubhouse-social-audio) is a new way to host AMAs and Q&amp;As that is being rolled out across the website. 

Our first guest: [John Luciew](https://twitter.com/JohnLuciew?t=qVJGFdykM9f19RLd2y1bsw&amp;s=09) from PennLive to talk about the [Harrisburg Murder House](https://www.pennlive.com/crime/2021/10/pennlive-investigation-to-unlock-106-years-of-secrets-inside-the-murder-house-of-harrisburg.html) 

John Luciew (pronounced LUCY) has been a print and digital journalist in Pennsylvania for 32 years, including the past 28 years at PennLive and the Patriot-News in Harrisburg. John is also a published author of more than 10 mystery/thrillers, including KILL THE STORY and FATAL DEAD LINES. 

His narrative-driven enterprise stories for PennLive have won numerous statewide awards, including Luciew twice being named the state’s Distinguished Writer, top honors from the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association. His national journalism honors include awards from Scripps Howard and Sigma Delta Chi. 

His previous narrative sagas include chronicling the long journey home for a local military veteran who lost both legs high above the knee in an Afghanistan blast, yet was determined to walk again. Luciew also traced the nomadic travels of so-called ‘Dirty Kids,’ a band of counterculture teen and twenty-somethings determined to live off the grid and crisscross the country largely by soliciting the kindness of strangers. 

Luciew began reporting and researching the just-published Murder House series in late March 2021, a journey that would bring him to Newark, Delaware, to meet the amateur sleuth pursing the 106-year-old case and finally to the Murder House basement, itself -- all in search of clues and in quest of justice for the girl in the cellar grave.

Singleton Lake, in Ashford Kent ([information and location of Ashford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford,_Kent,)) is a manmade lake that is known in the local area as a place to feed ducks, fish, and picnic. It has cycle and foot paths and is home to various forms of wildlife. In recent years it has been the recipient of cash injections to clean up the area and increase the wildlife it attracts. However, it has been historically blighted with anti-social behaviour and as such, in 2016, it was one of four places in Ashford that was granted a Public Spaces Protection Order which allows the councils to better tackle anti-social behaviour. It has also been the scene of numerous sexual assaults which have been documented in the local press.

[Example of sex attack at the lake](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/sex-attacker-john-williams-sentence-17626/)

On April 3rd, 1995, a couple were walking around the lake when they spotted a Motaworld\* plastic bag floating on the surface. The couple called the police who found a baby wrapped in Kleenex tissue and with paper stuffed in her mouth in the bag. A post-mortem found that the baby girl was 7lbs and was likely born between the 27th of March and 3rd April. The coroner also released that baby had been strangled with a pair of tights minutes after her birth. 

Operation Duke was launched, and Police contacted numerous Doctors and midwives to try to find the parents of the baby that they named April. In addition, they reached out to a total of 3858 people, many of these young girls who had not been in school at the time the baby was likely to have been born. Despite all of this, and appeals to the public through the local press, no one came forward and April was buried in Kennington Cemetery.

With advances in forensic technology the body of April was exhumed in 2011. Samples from her body allowed a DNA profile to be made and she was again put to rest in May 2011 in a service that was attended by police officers that had been involved in her case. In August of that year a fresh appeal was made, and people were asked to come forward with any information that they may have or to be discounted with DNA samples.

The only significant lead that the police had was a couple that had been found near the baby’s grave at the time of the exhumation. However, despite searches of the couple, and their car, the couple were eliminated from their enquiries.

The case has now been unsolved for over 25 years, but the babies grave continue to be cared for and toys and flowers left at the headstone. The one event of note, after the exhumation, was that gifts were stolen from her grave on the 20th anniversary. However, this was admonished in the strongest terms by the local community and was likely to be the actions of those unrelated to the case.

856,Pokechimp2021,[],1633930768,"This is my pet case and has been for a few years. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the case, here is a brief summary: 
https://www.ky3.com/2021/06/07/springfield-three-what-we-know-about-cold-case-29-years-later/ Sherrill Levitt's Charley Project page: https://charleyproject.org/case/sherrill-elizabeth-levitt

I'll summarize the case anyway. Suzie Streeter and Stacy McCall graduated from Kickapoo High School on 6 June 1992 in Springfield, Missouri. Afterwards, they attended a series of parties in Battlefield, a suburb just south of Springfield. They ended up at a party at the house of Janelle Kirby, a good friend of theirs. Their initial plan was to stay in a motel in Branson, Missouri for the night, as they were planning on going to a waterpark in that area the next morning. Eventually their plans changed and Suzie and Stacy decided to stay at Janelle's house for the night. However, Janelle's house was packed with a bunch of her relatives who stayed over for her graduation, so there was no space to sleep there. Consequently, Suzie and Stacy decided to head to Suzie and her mother, Sherrill Levitt's, house on 1717 E Delmar Street in Springfield to spend the night there. They left the Kirby residence at around 2:00am, in separate cars. It would have taken them about 20-30 minutes to get to the Levitt home. Meanwhile, Levitt was home alone for the evening at the Delmar residence. She was not expecting the girls to be home. She was last heard from at 11:15pm talking to a friend about painting a chest of drawers over the phone. There were no indications of anything amiss. It is assumed that the girls made it back to the Levitt home, since both their cars were there, they had taken their makeup off, and their beds were slept in.

The next morning, at around 8:00am, Kirby started calling the Levitt residence to wake her friends up for their waterpark trip, but there was no answer. She and her boyfriend, Mike Henson, continued to call the residence throughout the morning, but received to answer. Eventually, at around 11am, they made their way over to the house. Upon arrival, all 3 women's cars were in the driveway, the door was unlocked, and the women were not there. There were no signs of a struggle, apart from the front porch's bulb fixture being shattered by the front door. Kirby and Henson cleaned the mess, not aware of the fact that they potentially erased evidence. When inside, they received a crank call from a man making sexual innuendos, and just assumed it was a prank call. They eventually left the home and just assumed that the girls had gone to the water park without them.

It wasnt until later that evening when Janice McCall, Stacy's mother, reported them missing. She went to the Levitt home and while she was there, she also received a crank call making sexual innuendos. She also accidentally erased a voice message on the answering machine which might have contained evidence. She also noted that all 3 of the women's purses were lined up in a row in Suzie's room, which was very odd. She left the home and the investigation started the next day.

It was very clear that the women did not leave of their own accord. Suzie and Sherrill were chain smokers, and they carried their cigarettes with them wherever they went. Both women's cigarettes were found in the home, along with their purses. Stacy's clothes from the night before were found in the home too and her mother did not believe that she packed any other clothes with her, indicating that she could have left the residence in her panties. The beds were unmade and a book was turned over on Sherrill's bed, indicating she might have been interrupted while reading. The TV in the house was also on, but it was fuzzy. The family dog was left unattended and was acting anxiously. The front door was also left unlocked.

So, sometime between 2:30am, when the girls were assumed to have arrived home, and 8:00am, when Kirby started calling their house, something happened to the 3 women. As stated earlier, the only sign of a possible crime was the broken porch light fixture by the front door, but that was removed by Kirby, who I dont believe did it on purpose and she was just being helpful. Unfortunately, throughout the day before the women were reported missing, a number of worried family and friends had been going in and out of the house, going through belongings to determine where the women could have gone and cleaning things up inside the home. They did not realize that they were in a crime scene and removing potential evidence, even though they were also simply trying to help and had good intentions.

So, what most likely happened? 
For me, one of two things sparked this abduction: Either Sherril was targeted and was attacked before the girls arrived home, with the perp still being on the scene. Or someone spotted the girls driving home late at night and decided to follow them. I don’t think this was done by teenagers, personally. It had to have been someone with experience. Anyway, here goes:

Theory 1: Sherril was attacked first, before or as the girls got home

This is my personal theory, and would explain the lack of forced entry. Someone at least partially known to Sherril, perhaps a neighbour or a client of hers, had developed an obsession with her and decided to target her. With only one car being in the driveway at the time, the perp saw this as an easy opportunity. He made his move, but was interrupted as the girls got home. By that point, Sherril was possibly already unconscious or maybe even deceased, but the perp decided to wait a bit in her room as the girls were settling in for the night. When the girls went to bed, the perp tried to escape, but somehow alerted the girls to his presence in the process, so he had to take them too to not leave any witnesses. This is my pet theory.

Theory 2: The girls were spotted driving late at night by some creep, and was followed home

This is the second most likely theory to me, and it’s certainly very plausible. Since it was grad night, some creep with evil intentions would have seen this as an opportunity to prey on drunk high school graduates. The girls were spotted either as they were leaving the party, or somewhere along their route back home. It is unknown whether or not they made any stops along the way. When they got home, the perp(s) waited for a bit nearby, cased the house, and allowed the girls to go to bed before approaching the house. They somehow gained entry, either through an unlocked door or because one of the women simply let their guard down. From here, the women are all taken to the nearby getaway vehicle and that was the end of that. It’s a theory that fits most of the facts. The main problem I have with this one is that, if someone followed them home, they would have noticed an additional car at the house (Sherril’s) which, for all they know, could have belonged to some giant dude with an automatic rifle. Maybe they simply didn’t care, I don’t know. I just think that whoever did this knew that there were only women who lived there.

Which theory, in your opinion, is most likely: theory 1 or theory 2?","Springfield Three: Which of these 2 theories, in your opinion, is the most likely?"
857,LovetoClarkson,[],1633924305,"Was there a serial killer operating in Western Pa in 1977? And if so, who was he? 

Alleghany and Washington counties in Western Pennsylvania were rocked in 1977, as a series of violent rapes and murders swept across the same stretch of area. Citizen sleuths and private investigators alike had identified numerous possible victims, when in 2000 one of the murders (that of Debra Capiola, age 17) attributed to this phantom killer was solved by DNA. 

The arrest of David Robert Kennedy led to testing in some of the other cases, and the following information was made publicly available: that DNA found on the bodies of Susan Rush and Roberta Elam *was matching,* but not tied to anyone in the system. 

After hearing about the murder of Susan Rush, I got very interested in this case and did a deep dive the likes of which I have previously only done on murders within Mainland China, and there is a reason for that -- at one time I worked in the same mall as young Susan. I am originally from the Pittsburgh area, and have driven these streets and moved through these towns, and was shocked that I hadn’t heard about these murders. After speaking with a detective who worked on some of these cases, I am convinced that at least some of the murders below (beyond that of Susan and Roberta) were committed by the same individual or individuals. 

Below, I go through all 7 remaining victims and cases, along with my thoughts on possible perpetrators. I know this will be a long, rambling, very “IT’S PEPE SILVA!” post, so I appreciate your time and attention. 

I also want to make a note that I do not think this is at all an exhaustive list of all the women raped and murdered in Western Pennsylvania in 1973 to 1977. In many ways then (and let’s be honest, now), Western PA was very segregated, leading to a high likelihood of assaults and/or murders of Black women in the area that were not covered by the wider press. Should you know of any additional cases that fit this time period and location, please let me know so I can add them to my research. I have made a map of where all the bodies were found, marked by color, just to point out how close all these murders were together both in time and geography. To give a sense of their close location: in high school, I played with all of these victims' schools at local invitationals. 

Also, *shockingly* (the italics means sarcasm!) there is some victim blaming in the articles I cite below. I have not transferred that here, but please be aware that if that sort of thing makes you want to rage quit -- don’t click. Jenson and Holes’ murder squad also recently covered some of these cases but, I think, left out/misconstrued a few things. 

A list of the victims:

1. Debra Makel, 8 years old, 5 October 1973, strangled and raped;
2. Barbara Lewis, 30 years old, 20 November 1976, strangled and assaulted;
3. Susan Rush, 21 years old, 25 November 1976, strangled and raped;
4. Beth Lynn Barr, 6 years old, 23 November 1977, stabbed;
5. Mary Gency, 13 years old, 13 February 1977, beaten and raped **SOLVED;**
6. Debra Capiola, 17 years old, 17 March 1977, strangled and raped **SOLVED;**
7. Brenda Ritter, 18 years old, 19 May 1977, strangled and raped; 
8. Roberta Elam, 26 years old, 13 June 1977, strangled and raped.

**1.** **Debra Makel, 8 years old, 5 October 1973, strangled and raped in Jefferson Township, Greene County, Pa.** 

The youngest, and first possible victim, was Debra Makel. On the 5th of October in 1973 (a Friday), at 3:45pm, Debbie rode her school bus the two miles home from Dry Tavern Elementary School. There, she got off at the bus stop at Rice’s Landing, from which she had a five minute walk to her home at the end of Hoy Street, which is a dead-end road. The area is suburban, but fairly wooded. It was a nice, warm day, and a neighbor and a local jogger both saw the blond-haired, blue-eyed girl, who was wearing a green dress and carrying a pink purse that day. 

Debbie’s two brothers, 12 and 11 years old, had not ridden the bus that day, instead walking home to sell magazines for a school fundraiser. They did, however, briefly see her as they walked to neighbors at the beginning of the road. The Makel parents, Charlotte and Duane, were both at work, which was their custom. Duane taught at nearby Avella High School, whereas Charlotte worked at a clothing factory farther away in Nemacolin. When the Makel brothers came home, they found Debbie’s school books, coat, and house keys on the inside table -- but no Debbie. It was assumed she was out playing. When Debbie did not return home by dinner, though, the family was concerned and called police. Right away a massive search started, with over 180 people -- including police officers and firefighters -- moving across the county. 

When that evening an announcement was made at the high school (Jefferson-Morgan), people fled the stands to keep looking. Dogs from the local penitentiary were brought in, and boy scout troops came out. While this stirring of community support is touching, everyone who has ever spent too long watching *Forensic Files* is likely panicking -- because hundreds of people flooded the Makel home and neighborhood, without too much organization or tracking.  

The search continued into the weekend, two of Makel’s young cousins were only 10 minutes away (by foot) from the Makel home into the woods when they saw green fabric poking out of some leaves. They moved a log, and found Makel’s body. The young girl had been raped and then strangled with a piece of twine; she’d been strangled so hard her larynx had broken. She was partially clothed, and a pillowcase had been placed over her head. She was in a part of the woods called “Pumpkin Run,” which is an old distillery foundation. She had no defensive wounds. 

DNA in this case had been submitted, but didn’t match anyone in the database. This case remains cold, and who killed the bubbly 8 year old, who was a straight-A student and loved dancing, is unknown.

**2. Barbara Lewis, 30 years old, 20 November 1976, strangled and raped in Churchill, Pittsburgh, Pa.** 

Barbara was a secretary at the offices of Rockwell International, which was located in the U.S. Steel Building in Pittsburgh. Every morning she left her house, where she lived with her parents and sister Mary Beth, and walked past five other houses, and then took a bus to the downtown area. 

On the 19th of November 1976, Barbara (a mere four days after her 30th birthday), was running late. Her sister left for work without her at 6:15, and Barbara was to take the next bus which came at 6:30. 

No one knows what happened from 6:15 to 9:03, but at 9:03 a cleaning lady at the Blackridge Civic Association found Barbara’s still-warm body in the commercial-grade trash bin behind the building, covered in ceiling tiles. The Civic Association is 1.1 miles away from her home, a mere three-minute drive. 

Barbara had been strangled with one nylon stocking; her hands were tied behind her back with another stocking and a belt from her dress. After death, paper gauze had been tightly packed into her nose and mouth. Her underwear was on inside out, and her bra was torn and pulled partially off. However, the coroner’s office ruled she had not been raped. Police simply reported that she had been assaulted, though other reporting since then has commented that she was raped. She had no defensive wounds. 

Days after her death, her purse, blouse, and coat were found in a wooded area near Woodlawn Cemetary, but were not scattered -- instead, they were dumped together, as if from her attacker. 

Her death is still unsolved, and I can find no mention of DNA evidence being submitted. 

**3. Susan Rush, 21 years old, 25 November 1976, strangled and raped in South Strabane, Washington, Pa.** 

Susan was a quiet, sweet girl who enjoyed spending time with her family. She was deeply religious and, at the time of her death, had never even been on a date. At 5:00pm, Susan left her job at Murphy’s department store at the Washington Mall in South Strabane.  There Susan was a sales associate, but she also frequently worked in the store's coffee bar. She then went to Weight Watchers, which was located in the same mall complex but across the parking lot. 

That evening at 7pm she was due to attend Thanksgiving church services with her family, but did not show up. Her family started looking for her immediately, and went to the mall -- both she and her car were missing. They also searched along the nearby roads, thinking she may have broken down. They found nothing until the next day, when her brother, Gary Rush, found her car parked along North Avenue, less than a mile from the mall. 

North Avenue is not connected to the mall -- you’d have to cross a highway to get to it -- and is a small residential neighborhood. Her car doors were locked, but her brother could see her underwear and bra were sitting on the car’s front passenger seat. When Gary opened the car’s trunk, he found Susan’s body. She had been re-dressed in her torn slacks and an inside-out turtleneck. 

She had been strangled with a piece of leather so severely her larynx was crushed, and there were no bruises or scratches on the body, except for the ligature marks. She had been raped, though she had no defensive wounds. 

In 2000, DNA found at the scene tied her murderer to that of the murder of Roberta Elam. 

**4. Beth Lynn Barr, 6 years old, 23 November 1977, stabbed in Wilkinsburg, Pa.** 

The youngest of all the victims, Beth Lynn was only six. On the afternoon of November 23, 1977, she was given an early dismissal from school due to the Thanksgiving holiday. She was meant to walk the ten minutes from school to home with a friend, but that day the friend had an appointment and was picked up by her mother. Beth Lynn then began walking home by herself; this is a popular residential area, and many kids were out -- it was considered normal for all the kids to walk by themselves. 

People reported seeing Beth Lynn along her route, until one elderly neighbor noticed her talking to a man in a car (a blue sedan with red and white license plates) three blocks from her house. 

When Beth Lynn didn’t make it home, the alarm went off immediately -- Beth Lynn’s father was a local Wilkinsburg police officer, and he, his co-workers, and dozens of neighbors began looking for the little blonde haired girl. Tragically, nothing was found. 

Then 16 months later, only a few days off from when she was taken, her body was found in a cemetery in Monroeville by a man walking his dog. An autopsy showed she had been stabbed in the chest multiple times. She was still wearing the clothes she had been taken in. Monroeville is in Allegheny County, but very close to Wilkinsburg. 

At various times the police had a number of suspects, and even arrested and released a man pending an alibi, but the crime still remains unsolved. 

**5. Mary Gency, 16 years old, 13 February 1977, beaten and raped in Charleroi, Allegheny County, Pa. (SOLVED)**

I am including these solved cases to let you all know what cases local law enforcement were looking into at the time these cases occurred. I have moved through these cases quickly, but please let me know if you’d like any more detail. 

Mary was a beautiful young girl in her sophomore year of highschool, who had recently announced she was pregnant. The father was identified as her ex boyfriend, Robert William Urwin Jr (then 19). She left her home at 7pm to walk to a nearby store, Isaly’s, but never arrived. When Mary then didn’t make it home quickly, people started searching. 

A neighbor later noted that she saw Mary riding in a car driven by David Bernard Davoli (a former classmate). around 8:30pm; another told state police that at around 8pm he had found a purse in the middle of the street; when he turned over the purse, it was Mary’s. 

The search continued for days, though police initially focused on her ex, Urwin, suspecting he had harmed her. On the 19th, however, in the early morning deer hunters found Mary’s body in a hayfield near the Charleroi Sportsman's Club in Fallowfield Township. Mary had been raped, and then beaten to death -- she had multiple skull fractures inflicted by a heavy object. 

However, Mary’s family believes that Urwin is innocent, and was wrongfully convicted. He was charged once in 1977, but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence. He was recharged in 2010, following DNA evidence, with both he and Davoli being arrested and convicted (he for murder, Davoli for hindering apprehension and tampering with physical evidence). 

**6. Debra Capiola, 17 years old, 17 March 1977, strangled and raped in Robinson, Allegheny County, Pa. (SOLVED)**

Debra Capiola went missing sometime between 7:45am and 8:00am on March 17, 1977. She was on her way to catch the school bus from her home on Point Park Road, Robinson, Allegheny County. Never made the bus, which was only a 5 minute walk away. She typically walked with her brother, but he was unable to walk with her that day. 

8 days later, some kids found some items belonging to Capiola at an area called Blue Lake.

10 days later, her naked body was found on a hillside near an old strip mine, only 3 miles away from her home. It was determined she had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with the leg of her blue jeans.

If you are unfamiliar with the landscape of western Pennsylvania, just a general note -- the foliage is very, very thick and verdant; it is certainly rational to assume that her body could have been there for quite some time. 

David Robert Kennedy was arrested in 2000 after DNA tied him to the crime, though police had suspected him from the beginning. However, I want to note that Kennedy is by all accounts a very bad man; police, including one female investigator who Kennedy *began openly stalking while they investigated him,* Kennedy likely has other victims. At the time of the murders, he was a civilian mechanic at the 911th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve base in Moon, Allegheny County, which would have taken him all around western Pa. 

If Kennedy committed more crimes, however, why doesn’t his DNA appear anywhere else?  

**7. Brenda Ritter, 18 years old, 19 May 1977, strangled and raped in North Strabane, Washington, Pa.** 

Brenda was a well-liked, pretty blonde secretary at a local construction company Kennedy and Carter, who had a lot of friends at the time of her death. Like many young women in the area, she knew about the strangler cases and had spoken with her family and friends about it. Many noted she was incredibly diligent about personal safety; that night, her boyfriend and his mother checked the doors of her Ford Pinto to make sure they were all locked. 

On the 19th of May, Brenda had been at her boyfriend Larry’s house when it began raining heavily around 10pm. She decided to head home, but never made it. When her parents noticed her missing in the morning then began searching for her; police then found her car parked along a rural road in nearby South Strabane township. Her purse was sitting on the passenger seat, open, with her pocket book out and her drivers license sitting beside it. Otherwise, the car appeared untouched. Also of note -- Brenda’s route home would not have taken her to South Strabane. Instead, she should have been in the Meadowlands area. 

Police began to look for Brenda, including calling out a helicopter from the local airport; not even a mile away, Brenda’s body was found. She was naked on a densely wooded hillside, with her clothes piled 50 feet away. She had been raped and then strangled with a tourniquet made from her underwear and a stick taken from a nearby bush. Her time of death was determined to be between 11:30 p.m. and midnight.

**8. Roberta Elam, 26 years old, 13 June 1977, strangled and raped in Wheeling, West Virginia.** 

Typically called Sister Robin, Robin Elam went to the Mt. St. Joseph church and nunnery on June 1st to continue her training to become a nun. Just two weeks later, as she began an eight day silent retreat, she was raped and killed by an unknown assailant. She was a vivacious and funny woman, who enjoyed history and poetry; she also was in great shape, frequently hiking and jogging. 

Sisters reported seeing her walk to a green metal bench overlooking a golf course on a hill near the Mother House, one often used by the nuns for prayer and reflection. This bench was only about 100 yards away from the main building. When she didn’t return, some sisters went looking for her and found her body 30 feet away at about 2:00pm. Her shirt and bra were pulled up to her shoulders, and her jeans and underwear were pulled down, with one leg completely bare. She had been strangled by the assailants bare hands -- there were clear fingerprint marks on her neck. She had no defensive wounds. 

Witnesses from the golf course nearby, as well as a groundskeeper for Mt. St. Joseph reported seeing a white male in his 30s, with dirty, dark hair, bushy eyebrows, a mustache and beard,  between 5’10” and 6 feet tall, driving a rusty, gray or faded-blue Chevrolet or Buick, festooned with religious and coal-mining bumper stickers, but the man was never found. 

A local man, John Shoplak, was thought to have possibly been involved -- he new details not released to the public, like that Roberta had been menstrating at the time of her murder. Shoplak had also bragged about murdering a nun to friends, was known to hate Catholics, and had a violent history (strangling a number of former girlfriends, and strangling his grandmother and cutting off her finger during a robbery). His blood type, taken from military records, did not match blood at the scene (though direct samples were never taken). Shoplak died in 2019. 

This case remains unsolved.

Notebly, Sister Robin’s was the first case to get national attention -- and after her death, the string of strangling's ended. 

**Possible theories:** 

**Law enforcement** 

What would make children and young women go with a stranger? From the beginning, many suspected a member of law enforcement or someone impersonating an officer. This was especially true after the murder of Brenda Ritter, where it very much seemed like the young woman may have pulled over for a traffic stop. The day after her body was discovered, two people came forward and said they saw a police car belonging to Sheriff Hanna ""Pie"" Johns parked behind Ritter’s that evening. 

Johns was brought in for questioning, then released; two days later, he committed suicide. His family stated his depression had been brought on by his losing his bid for the Democratic nomination for sheriff just two days before Ritter's death (sheriff’s are elected in Pa; this means Johns would have been out of a job), and his current divorce proceedings. 

However, I don’t think Johns is a viable suspect -- he seems to have been heavily investigated, and had died by the time of Roberta’s murder. As DNA matches in Roberta and Susan’s murder, it’s not possible for him to have committed both -- and I very much do think Susan and Brenda had been killed by the same person. 

**Partner killers** 

Many of the places bodies were left are not walkable, suggesting the murderer had access to a car after the crime. But, if you’re dumping a car, how do you have a secondary one there already? A fear in the area then was that there was a pair of men committing these crimes. 

Personally, I think most, if not all, of these crimes are related -- they’re just so close in location and time. I hope these are cases that can be solved sooner rather than later, because something else that unites all of them? In every article, the families of these girls and women talk about how much they want to know what happened.

And if so, who was he?"
858,Quirky-Motor,[],1633905351,"International Day of Older Persons is held annually on October 1st, so I wanted to share a collection of stories about missing people who are older adults during this month. But I also wanted to share these stories for another reason, namely ageism in the true crime community, which is something I have never seen explicitly addressed.

At this point many people have heard of the term “missing white woman syndrome,” a phenomenon in which the media latches on the cases of only missing white women, at the expense of everyone else. However, it is a little more complex than just being white and female. The women who get the most attention are almost always at least middle class, educated or otherwise upwardly mobile, traditionally attractive, and young. This narrative allows the cases of older individuals, as well as other groups, to be pushed aside and deemed not interesting enough to be featured in the media which is truly tragic. When asked why some cases receive massive attention while others are entirely ignored, Beth Karas, attorney, legal analyst, and TV reporter said it best when she explained, “we \[the media\] have an obsession with crime...we also have an obsession with youth and beauty.”

Another reason older individuals are not often discussed, at least in my opinion, is because there is a high likelihood that some of these people simply wandered away and succumbed to the elements, but this is not an excuse to forget about these missing people. After all, the elderly are not the only people who wander away or get otherwise confused and perish at the hands of nature. This is the theory for *many* missing people who still get massive attention in the media and online such as Maura Murray or Asha Degree.

The third and final thing that I would like to address is the blatant ageism and disrespect that I have seen in this very community when someone highlights the cases of elderly individuals. It was actually some of this feedback on my own pieces which made me realize the need for a piece like this one. I once had a post reported by a reader because my write up on a missing 86 year old man with dementia was “not a mystery” even though his body was not (and still has not) been recovered. One commenter called the write up “low effort” and another said that there is “no mystery” when an old person goes missing, and a third said that his case was “not good content.” I think it is imperative that we remember as we read about real people’s stories that missing people are **NOT** content. They are real people who are missing and whether or not the circumstances surrounding their disappearances and final days are mysterious or mundane, their cases deserve exposure and everyone deserves to be laid to rest.

I hope that did not come across as too much of a rant and it goes without saying that I know most readers are nothing but compassionate and respectful to the people in these stories. Without further ado, here is a collection of stories featuring older individuals. If you know of other cases matching this criteria (let’s say those 60+) please feel free to share in the comment section below.

**Missing**

**Leo Widicker,** 86, of Harvey, North Dakota went missing on November 8th, 2001 from Tabacon Hot Springs, Costa Rica. Leo and his wife of 55 years, Virginia, were part of a pay-your-own way service group called Maranatha Volunteers International, a Christian group that builds homes, churches, and schools. In between two different jobs the group stopped at Tabacon Hot Springs resort for lunch. Leo was last seen sitting on a bench while his wife waded nearby, but within 20 minutes he was gone. Someone drove 10 miles down the road looking for him within minutes of his disappearance but no trace of Leo was ever found.

Theories in the case abound. Some think Leo got lost and perished in the volcanic landscape, some think he was hit by a car and flew down the hill into the jungle, while others think he was picked up by someone in a vehicle who did him harm or gave him a ride to another area where he perished from either foul play or misadventure. Leo Widicker is described as a white male, 86 years old in 2001, who was 5’6” and 145 lbs. Leo has blue eyes and is mostly bald. His remaining hair is reportedly blondish- gray. He wears hearing aids and glasses and also has a pacemaker. When last seen he was wearing a white baseball cap, jeans, black shoes, a red and blue plaid shirt, a blue jacket and a name tag. If you have any information on the disappearance of Leo please contact United States Embassy San Jose, Costa Rica Office at 011-506-220-3939.

**Donald Richard Delaney,** age 60 was last seen in King County Washington in November, 2003. His brother reported him missing after not hearing from his brother for months. Delaney may have gone to Mason county, near the Olympic National forest as he liked to frequent the area. Delaney is legally blind, and suffers from type 2 diabetes. Even though he is legally blind he can reportedly see well enough to live independently but not drive. Because of his diabetes he always travels with a small red and white cooler with a lid, food, protein powder, herbal supplements, vitamins and his medication usually inside. He also carries a black leather backpack with books inside, and a small blue duffle bag sometimes with dry food or extra medication. Delaney is described as a white male, with brown eyes, and graying brown hair. His left eye is partially sewn shut and he usually wears a mustache. He is 5’10” and 220 lbs. Mason County police are investigating Delaney's disappearance, they can be contacted at 360-427-9670 ext. 313 Sources [https://charleyproject.org/case/donald-richard-delaney](https://charleyproject.org/case/donald-richard-delaney)

**Rose E. Eaton,** age 73, was last seen on July 25th 1994 in Chimacum, an unincorporated area in Jefferson Co. Washington state. Rose was in her son’s car waiting for him to drive her to the dentist when her son noticed that several livestock animals had gotten loose. He told his mom to wait in the car but when he got back 10 minutes later, his mother was gone. Her purse was also missing but the family’s German Shepherd was still in the vehicle. The man looked for his mother for a few minutes but couldn’t find her and he found that the door to their home was still locked. He promptly called the police. Tracking dogs traced Rose’s scent down the dirt road for about ⅓ of a mile to the junction of the main paved road (Beaver Valley Road) when the trail abruptly stopped, leading investigators to think Rose may have entered a motor vehicle at that location. No other trace of her has ever been found.

Rose is described as a white female with gray hair and blue eyes. She is 5’9” and 160 lbs. At the time she lived with her son and had been diagnosed with dementia several years earlier but was reportedly physically in good health. She was last seen wearing a long sky blue coat with buttons down the front, a long light blue dress, a tan purse with little to no money inside, and blue rubber soled orthopedic shoes size 8.5. Rose has previously fractured her upper left arm. She has a small scar on the back of her neck and a scar on her abdomen. She is a non-smoker and non-drinker. She does not drive. Foul play is not suspected in this case but it has not been totally ruled out by law enforcement due to the scent trail found by search dogs. If you have any information please contact the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office at 360-385-3831.

**Jerry Alan Graves** was last seen on Dec. 25th 2018 and was reported missing several days later. The 69 year old was reportedly last seen walking down highway 12 away from the ranch he lived at in Clarkston, Washington. He was upset at the idea of moving into a nursing home and threatened to leave the area. It is unknown if this conversation had happened on that day or previously and who he was talking to about this potential move remains unknown. Jerry left behind all of his belongings, money, cell phone, and clothing. He is known to hitchhike between the towns of Clarkston and Pomeroy which are about 30 miles apart. The area Jerry was last seen in is a very rural area with few people near the border with Idaho.

Jerry is described as a white male, 5’8” and 125 lbs with brown gray hair, brown eyes, and a gray beard. He was wearing a dark colored coat and blue jeans when he was last seen. He had a broken leg at the time of his disappearance. He may have had a stroke before he disappeared and was showing possible signs of dementia. If you have any information please contact the Asotin County Sheriff’s Office at 509-758-2331. [https://charleyproject.org/case/jerry-alan-graves](https://charleyproject.org/case/jerry-alan-graves)

**Walter Dunson**, a WWI vet was almost centenarian when he was reported missing in 1998. However, within a week police began to speculate that Walter Dunson had actually died or disappeared fifteen years earlier. Walter is described as a thin black male, 97 years old at the time of last contact. He was about 5’8” and weighed 150 lbs. He was wearing a light brown shirt, dark brown pants, black leather shoes and a dark blue navy peacoat. He was also carrying a black leather wallet with about 15 dollars in it. He may also have a lottery card in his possession. He wears dentures and reading glasses. In his composite he has some facial hair but in real photos he is clean shaven. Some agencies give Dunson's date of birth as July 2, 1899 or July 7, 1900. If alive he would be 121 years old today. If you have any information on the disappearance of Walter Dunson please call Cincinnati Crime Stoppers at 513-352-3040. My full write up can be found here.

When researching the above case, I came upon a **John Doe** from Cincinnati who could be a match to Walter Dunson. According to the Ohio State ME’s office, “on 07/08/1986, the remains of a 50-99 year old black male were discovered in an abandoned apartment building on Republic Street in Cincinnati, OH. This individual measured 68"" in height and was wearing a tan long sleeved pullover shirt, a v-neck tan sweater, brown trousers, a brown belt, a tan sweater, white socks with green stripes, brown leather shoes, and a blue baseball cap.” According to Namus the building entrance was barricaded from the inside as if someone was living in the building and the man had been dead for several weeks. The man’s height, age range, and even clothing seems to match with Walter Dunson. Is it possible that Walter, who had been homeless in the past, was again living on the streets or had wandered from son’s home only to pass away while staying in this abandoned building? I have submitted Walter Dunson as a match to this man via both the Hamilton County Coroner's office and Namus. Even if this individual is not Dunson, he still deserves to have his name back.

In June of 2018, **Sharran Lee Haije,** age 78, was last spotted walking down Wright-Bliss Rd off of 105th street just north of the Vaughn Civic Center in Gig Harbor, Washington. She was wearing a blue nightgown and green rubber gardening clogs. She has been diagnosed with dementia and has limited speech abilities. She may be confused and not know where she lives or how to get home. In the past she has wandered into strangers’ houses. Haije has gray hair dyed a dark red color and blue eyes. She is white and 5’6” tall and weighs between 150-165 lbs. Her last name is pronounced hay-gee and in most publications her name is spelled “Sharron.” According to Pierce County Sheriff's office, the search for Haije was started very soon after she went missing and was exhaustive. Police do not believe Haije is in the area and have reason to believe she entered a car near where she was last seen. Please call 253-798-7530 if you have any information on this case.

**Dong Chull Jung** disappeared within minutes in Lakewood, Washington. The 78 year old was residing at the Golden Lion Motel on Tacoma Way in Lakewood, Washington. The establishment has long been a hotbed of criminal activity and violence since at least the 1990s. On average the police responded to incidents at the 24-room hotel over 100 times per year. November 22nd 2003 was one of those times. On that day witnesses called the police after hearing a “disturbance” in Dong’s room. When the authorities arrived, they found a giant pool of blood on the floor as well as Dong’s prescription eyeglasses, but Dong was nowhere to be found. According to the News Tribune, a paper out of Tacoma, one week before Dong’s disappearance he was granted a temporary domestic violence protection order from a Paul C. Jung, who might be Dong’s adult son. In June of 2003, someone named Hae Sung Jung, got a restraining order against Dong. Hae might be the estranged wife of Dong, but this isn’t known for sure. There are vague reports that Dong was having “marital issues'' at the time of his disappearance. Very little information is available in the case. The Golden Lion Inn was finally torn down in 2017 but the fate of the elderly man who resided within remains a mystery. Dong is described as an Asian male, with brown eyes and thinning gray hair. He is 5’6'' and weighs 135 lbs. Dong wears prescription eyeglasses but they were left behind when he vanished. If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Dong Jung please call Pierce County Crime Stoppers 253-591-5959.

**Richard Emanuel Lawrence,** age 63 left his home in Portland in February of 1986 to attend a religious conference in Tacoma, Washington with his wife. On the 28th of February Richard left his hotel room to get gas for his car at about 5 pm and disappeared. Two months later, Richard’s vehicle was found abandoned on a seldom used logging road in Vadar, Washington 80 miles south of Tacoma. A newspaper from Feb. 28th and a note saying \`\`Will pick up car tonight or tomorrow"" were found either inside the car or near it. It is believed that Lawrence got lost while attempting to get home to Portland when he parked his car and left the vehicle. Two locals reported seeing a man matching Lawrence’s description walking down the logging road, the day after Lawrence was last seen. Both witnesses reported that Lawrence seemed to be walking somewhere and didn’t seem to be in distress. Local law enforcement thinks it is possible that he was picked up by someone on the road. Lawrence had gotten confused while driving twice in the recent past, once two weeks before his disappearance in Portland and once the day before in Tacoma. He was reportedly upset knowing he might have been in the beginning stages of dementia or another health issue.

Lawrence is described as a black male, with thinning brown hair and brown eyes. He weighed 125 lbs and stood at only 5’ tall. He was last seen wearing a black rim glasses, with a prescription lens in the right lens; the left lens was plain glass as well as a black fur type knee length coat, black Russian style hat, white shirt with tie and black dress shoes size, 5. He had suffered a heart attack a year before his disappearance, and wore a pacemaker. He was reportedly depressed about his physical condition.

**Cecil Socrates Mann,** 76 disappeared from Port Orchard, Washington in 2012. Mann was last seen at 10 am on September 15th leaving his home in his 2007 Ford Focus. Later searches indicated that fishing gear disappeared with Mann and it is speculated he left his home to go fishing. Mann was then seen 3 hours later north of his home buying gas and the clerk reported that he seemed confused or disoriented. Two days later on September 17th, Mann called his daughter on two separate occasions but the reception was so poor no one knew what he was saying. Soon after the phone was turned off and the “pings” came from the Quilcene, Washington area. Later that same day, Mann’s car was found abandoned in the next county over near a Tunnel Creek Trail about 50 miles from his home and ten miles from the town of Quilcene. The car was badly damaged presumably from the rough terrain. Tragically, no trace of Cecil Mann was ever found. Mann did not have any mental health concerns at the time of his disappearance and had never shown signs of dementia, however, he was new to the Port Orchard area and wasn’t yet familiar with the area. At the time of his disappearance he was recovering from a bout with prostate cancer.

Mann is described as a white male who is balding with some gray hair. He has blue eyes and wears bifocals with wire frames. He weighed only 135 lbs and stood at 5’8”. He was last seen wearing a tan or green windbreaker jacket, blue jeans, gray sneakers and a watch. If you have any information please call the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office at 360-337-4642.

**Christine Shields Wagner,** 67 years old went missing from Olympia Washington in 2016. She was last spotted leaving her home in early October of that year. Her cell phone has been turned off since she disappeared. About two weeks later her car was found abandoned at the Harmony Farm conservation easement on Johnson Point Road in Olympia. Her car was normally parked in the parking lot. Harmony Farm easement is not a rural area but does border on a large wetland reserve. Christine is described as a white female with brown eyes and brown hair. She wears glasses and she is 5 ft 3 in tall and weighs 130 to 180 lbs. In the past she has made attempts to harm herself. There is very little information available about this disappearance. Thurston County Sheriff's Office 360-786-5500 is investigating.

**Estelle Lois Abbott** of Inchelium, Washington went missing in 2017. Estelle was 83 years old and has been diagnosed with Alzheimers. She left home with her dog, a gray or tan pitbull named Jay, to check the mail and never returned. It is unknown if Jay was ever found. Searches on foot, horseback, and ATV started right away but no sign was ever found of Estelle Abbott. Estelle is described as a white female with blonde hair and blue eyes. She's about 5’ 7” in height, 150 lbs. and she was last seen wearing a red sweater and blue jeans. In the past Estelle has lived in Spokane, Washington and Sonoma, California and her loved ones are worried she may have tried to travel there. Estelle lived on the Colville Indian Reservation and tribal police are investigating. They can be reached at 509-634-2472.

**Bernard Schieber,** 86, of Yakima, Washington has not been seen since Aug. 8, 2019, when he left his home in the 2500 block of South 84th Avenue in Yakima. His black, full-size Chevrolet pickup was found a few weeks later in a closed portion of the Yakama Nation reservation. It appears to have been parked normally and not crashed or damaged. When he left his home in the city of Yakima, Bernard had only ¼ tank of gas and no money. He suffers from dementia. Bernard is described as a white male with blue eyes and gray hair. He weighs 190 lbs. and stands 5’ 11” tall. Anyone with any information about Schieber is asked to call the Yakima County Sheriff's Office at 509-574-2500. He is still missing.

**Lawrence Jay ""Larry"" Riegel**, 57 of Yakima, Washington worked as a carpenter and contract pilot before breaking four vertebrae, an injury that left him disabled. Right before going missing Larry had a surgery on his neck and some sources claim he was in a neck brace. Unable to work, Riegel was collecting disability. The last contact anyone had with Larry took place on Christmas day, 2009. He contacted several relatives and friends including a call to his mother to thank her for some clothes she bought him for the holiday. He was supposed to join his family in Yakima for a belated Christmas dinner on Dec. 26, 2009, but he never showed up or called. Riegel’s family described him as a “chatty Cathy” who talked to just about anyone and had daily phone contact with his friends and family. Riegel’s last phone call took place at approximately 5:30 pm on Christmas day. It is believed that the call was made to Riegel’s tenants who rented a farm from him in Union Gap, a town on the reservation. His tenants owed him $3000 in back rent.

Riegel lived with his girlfriend, Ladena Mann before he went missing. Mann claimed that the couple argued on Christmas day and Riegel left the home presumably to go see his tenants. She also claimed that Riegel assaulted her either on Christmas day or on January 4th before disappearing. When Mann tried to report this assault weeks later, she was unable because she had no injuries or proof of violence. Mann used Riegel’s money and EBT card after he disappeared as well as applied for her own EBT card claiming she still lived with Larry. Mann was charged with welfare fraud and perjury, but charges were dropped when she paid back the money and entered a diversion program. In one media interview she claimed that Larry is still alive and that he has “contacted several people” since going missing. She thinks Larry is residing in Idaho or Montana and has accused his family of knowing where he is. Ladena Mann is a person of interest in Larry’s disappearance as are his tenants, the last known people to have spoken to him.

Riegel’s family is offering $25,000 for information in the homicide investigation that leads to his remains. They have billboards all over the Yakima valley asking for information. Larry’s mother, aged 90, still drives around rural areas searching for his body.

Riegel is described as a white male with gray hair, a gray mustache, and hazel eyes. He is 6’2'' and weighs 200 lbs. He has surgical scars on his left knee and a prominent vertical scar on his neck from recent surgery to fix four broken vertebrae. He often wears eyeglasses and he has a limp in his left leg. He is also an alcoholic who frequented neighborhood bars. The Yakima Police Department (509-576-6573) is investigating.

**Donnie Sampson**, 71, a well-known religious leader, had been serving for eight years on theY akama Tribal Council’s Code of Ethics Committee when he disappeared in the fall of 1994 while hunting elk about 45 miles west of White Swan, Washington, near Mt. Adams. Donnie had a heart problem and had been prescribed nitroglycerin as a result. Right before his disappearance, he told his daughter that he (and the ethics committee) “was getting into something that’s going to make everybody mad.” He even went so far to tell her that he would be “making enemies” and that she and the community would hear about his findings soon enough. He had been investigating rumors of corruption in the tribal council and the housing authority before he went missing, but other committee members refused to elaborate on the matter.

Donnie’s truck was found Oct. 30, 1994, in the foothills of Mount Adams by volunteer searchers, but searchers found no trace of Sampson. His nitroglycerin, lunch, clothing and three rifles were found in his truck. A fourth rifle he left home with disappeared with him. Donnie’s children say tribal police have done little to investigate the disappearance, which they believe is a result of foul play. For example, his children were never interviewed and his truck was found by volunteers, not official search and rescue. Tribal authorities believe that the elderly Sampson simply got lost while hunting. There are no photos or description of Donnie Sampson available, althoygh we know he was Native American and 71 year old when he was last seen. Tribal police are investigating.

Bernard Schieber, Donnie Sampson, and Larry Reigel were all men who disappeared on or near the Yakama Indian Reservation and are featured in my write up here [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/i5rlwx/missing\_and\_murdered\_indigenousmen\_why\_are\_there/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/i5rlwx/missing_and_murdered_indigenousmen_why_are_there/) where I profiled the cases of over 20 men and boys who have gone missing or were murdered on Yakama reservation.

What happened to these people? Will their cases ever be solved?","In honor of the International Day of Older Persons and in order to combat ageism in the true crime community, I wanted to share a collection of stories involving older people who have gone missing or whose stories are otherwise unresolved"
859,CherryBlossom724,[],1633903236,"Olga Schultz was born in Wyoming in 1913. There is little information available about her early life, but it is known that she was a very outdoorsy person and that she grew up hunting, trapping, and fishing.

Side note: Interestingly, Olga was descended from a famous English-American scout, guide, and trapper named Richard ""Beaver Dick"" Leigh (1831-1899). Leigh is sometimes referred to as having been ""The West's last mountain man"". The moniker ""Beaver Dick"" was supposedly given to him by Brigham Young as a tribute to his trapping skills.

Olga met Carl Mauger, the man who would become her husband, at a dance in 1934. He was a 28-year-old oil man who had a girlfriend named Ella, whom he had been dating for 5-6 years by this point. Ella was deeply in love with Carl and wanted to marry him, but he continued to put off their wedding, saying that he wanted to be more financially secure before they got married. However, things changed when he saw Olga. It was said that they fell in love with each other at first sight and they apparently got a little too close to each other at the dance and in front of poor Ella, no less. Ella, understandably upset, stormed out. Carl broke things off with Ella right after the dance and began a whirlwind romance with Olga. Carl, the same man who had cited financial reasons for not wanting to marry Ella yet, went on marry Olga a matter of weeks after their first meeting. They got married on September 11, 1934.

Carl and Olga went camping in Togwotee Pass for their honeymoon. Their intention was to spend much of their time elk hunting during this trip. 

On September 17, 1934, Olga and Carl set out for a hike. Olga had a hatchet and sandwiches with her that day. At one point, Olga decided to stop and rest. Carl found this odd, because Olga had amazing stamina and typically didn't take any breaks during a hike. However, nothing else seemed to be out of the ordinary, so he told her that he was going to go on ahead to scout for elk and that he would return shortly. According to Carl, he was gone for around 20 minutes and when he returned Olga was gone. He called out for her repeatedly but there was no answer. 

Carl went back to camp to seek help in the search for Olga. The first person he told about Olga's disappearance was a ranger. The ranger then questioned Carl, asking him if he and Olga had had a fight that day or if he knew of any other reason that Olga might just choose to walk off. Carl said no and stated that everything had been fine that day.

A group went out to search but found no sign of Olga. They were also unable to follow her tracks. Over the course of the next few days, 300 people would aid in the search, including police officers, volunteers, and Indian trackers. Bloodhounds were also brought in. No traces of Olga were found. To make matters worse for the search, a snowstorm occurred just days after Olga went missing. 

Carl, being the closest person to Olga and also the last person known to have seen her alive, was considered the prime suspect in her disappearance and was jailed for two months. However, during this time he was questioned repeatedly and his story never wavered. Due to this and also to a total lack of evidence of foul play, Carl was later released. 

Olga's family staunchly believed in Carl's innocence and her sister Edith, in particular, strongly believed that Olga ran away. She said that Olga was very unhappy in her marriage and that she felt deeply guilty about the pain that they had caused Ella. She also said that Olga had wanted Edith to accompany them on their honeymoon, but she declined. Also, Ella had sent Olga letters following her breakup with Carl, telling Olga how devastated she was by the turn of events and that she felt suicidal as a result. According to some sources, Olga herself was also said to be suicidal and that she said as much in letters to her sister.

Also of note: The ranger mentioned earlier kept a diary and wrote a lot about this case and what he had found out while investigating it. According to him, Olga and Ella had managed to become friends.

**Theories**

* Accident/animal attack

* Suicide

* She ran away. She had been carrying $30 with her on the day she went missing, which is about $600 today. There was also a highway near the area she was last seen. Did she decide to hitchhike and start a new life elsewhere?

* Murder. Maybe she did leave voluntarily, but ended up meeting a bad end while hitchhiking. Maybe someone robbed and then murdered her. Or maybe Carl himself did something to Olga.

For years afterwards, Carl would periodically return to the site where he had last seen Olga and search for her again. Though seven years after she went missing, he filed for divorce and ended up marrying Ella.

It seems that there were never any solid leads about what happened to Olga or even any unconfirmed sightings. This is the oldest missing persons case in Wyoming.

860,isitbedtime-yet,[],1633894998,"  

The latest true crime I wanted to open for discussion is the murder of Danny King who lived in Aylesford near Maidstone in Kent. It has a small population of around 10,000 and its ‘claim to fame’ was having the largest paper recycling factory in Europe. It is also one of the safest small towns in Kent but with a higher-than-average drugs issue.

Danny King was 51 on the 17th of October 2008. He had returned from Spain three weeks prior and was currently unemployed. He was also known as ‘Shep’ and had been married to his wife since 1975. Danny was father to four children and a grandfather to eleven. On the night of the 17th Danny was at home with his wife Sylvia\*, his son, and four of his grandchildren. They retired to bed and Sylvia was in one room with their grandchildren and Danny in another. At approximately 3am gunfire was heard, and Danny was found with four gunshot wounds from a .38 calibre gun. He died at the scene.

Google map of the road where the killing took place - [ Medina Rd - Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.2974353,0.4555117,3a,75y,354.43h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHso9cGIBNH7Y2sMOZ2-tSA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)

A post-mortem, which took place on the 18th of October, declared that the injuries were not self-inflicted and Detective Chief Inspector Jon Bumpus agreed with the coroner and that the scene depicted a violent crime and no silencer had been on the gun. 40 police officers were assigned to work on the case, but no imminent arrests were made.

In January 2009 the lead detective released further information to the press and revealed that the case would be featured on the tv show Crimewatch (this is no longer airing however it was a popular show that portrayed reconstructions of unsolved crimes to reinvigorate investigations). Following its airing an arrest was made that was connected to a burglary that involved a car that was similar to one that was seen in the area the night Danny was killed where two people were seen running from Medina Road to a parked car on New Road (this can be seen on the linked google map). The police identified the car as being a Peugeot 207 Cabriolet Coupe and although they did not know the colour, they believed it wasn’t white and possibly stolen.  Two cars were noted as being of interest, one was stolen in Lambeth and found burnt out in Croydon, and the other was stolen in Dartford but never recovered.  (Dartford is 20 miles from Aylesford and Lambeth is 37 miles away).

Dt. Ch. Ins. Jon Bumpus also made the public aware of another shooting that had happened at Danny’s home in 2006. It was in November at 6pm that someone shot through the lounge window whilst all the family were at home. The shooter escaped in a Vauxhall Astra that was found in a nearby street burnt out. The detective has been quoted as saying that it was a miracle that no one was injured. Again, no arrests were made relating to this incident and the police stated that these two events may or may not be linked. They also, tellingly, stated that they were open to what the motive for the murder was.

On the anniversary of Danny’s murder his wife said “*He is missed very much. We cope with the support of each other, but the one-year anniversary is going to be hard to deal with.”* It was also, at the time of this quote, that Danny’s twelfth grandchild was born. In the subsequent twelve years, since the airing of the show, no other arrests have been made and the killer or killers remain at large.

I would be interested in your opinions on this case and potential reasons for Danny’s murders. I have looked through all the resources online but can find very little updated information from 2009. 

\*Danny’s wife’s name is documented as Sylvia in some press articles but Celia in others.

861,ladysvenska,[],1633890205,"A big thank you to r/MSM1969 for telling me about the website ourblackgirls.com!

I recently made a post regarding a theory I had about St Louis Jane Doe and why detectives didn't turn up an apparent match of a missing girl of a similar age: my theory was she actually disappeared at a younger age.

User r/MSM1969 suggested looking at the website OurBlackGirls for potential matches. There aren't many entries for the 1970s but there is one that aligns surprisingly well: https://ourblackgirls.com/2020/03/28/pamela-mayfield-5-her-brother-michael-6-were-last-seen-in-a-strangers-car/

Pamela and her brother disappeared January 10th, 1978, from Houston, Texas. They were last seen getting into a strangers car. Pamela was five at the time, making her 10 at the time Jane Doe would have died, fitting with the age range of the Doe (who was quite tall). The area she grew up in also aligns with isotope tests conducted on Jane Doe - she appeared to have been raised in the South.

There are conflicting statements given about whether this was a none-family abduction or not. But either way, neither have been seen again.

The obvious questions to be looked at for Pamela to be Jane Doe: why were she and her brother taken? Jane Doe was well cared for, and there has been suggestion she and Michael were indeed taken by a relative. If so, why would they kidnap them, care for them only to brutally rape and murder Pamela and likely dispose of Michael too? 

There's several scenarios that could work: the relative who originally took them (if that is what happened) either fell on hard times and wasn't taking care of/watching them well and someone took advantage of that, or the original kidnapper died and they were left with someone truly evil.

In the former case, the relative could not report what happened for the obvious reason they had no rights to those children in the first place. But if so, why has Michael not come forward looking for his sister? In the second scenario - in fact the big flaw in this entire theory - is where is Michael? And why would a relative even take the children, given they were loved and cared for?

A stranger abduction raises even more questions. Was Pamela the target the entire tome, being younger and easier to control, and they persuaded Michael to come along too so as not to seem odd or cause a scene? If so, he likely would've been killed shortly after and a John Doe himself who simply wasn't connected to Michael, especially if he was also killed in St Louis. Or were both kept alive for some time? 

It's a theory with some very disturbing avenues. 

Of course, it may be Michael and Pamela are still alive. That would be incredible, even though it would still leave us with our unnamed Doe. But I tend to doubt it.

862,Doktor_Winter,[],1633833951,"Madeleine McCann vanished from her family’s holiday flat at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007. The suspect is the convicted paedophile and rapist Christian B (last name censored in German media) who was living in a camper van close to Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared.

German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters was quoted in an article by the Mirror saying the following things:


“We’re confident we have the man who took and killed her.”

“It is now possible that we could charge. We have that evidence now. But it’s not just about charging him – we want to charge him with the best body of evidence possible. 
When we still have questions, it would be nonsense to charge rather than wait for the answers that could strengthen our position.
That’s why we said we’ll investigate as long as there are leads or information for us to pursue. I’m not saying that what we have is insufficient now. But he’s in prison, so we don’t have this pressure on us. We have time on our hands.”

“All I can do is ask for your patience. I personally think a conclusion will be reached next year. We have no body and no DNA but we have other evidence. Based on the evidence we have, it leads to no other conclusion.
I can’t tell you on which basis we assume she is dead. But for us, there’s no other possibility. There is no hope she is alive.”

“It is circumstantial evidence – we have no scientific evidence. If we had a video of the act or a picture of Madeleine dead with B. on camera, we wouldn’t have had to make a public appeal. But we only have circumstantial evidence.”

“It could have gone better. Of course we hoped we’d get such good tip-offs that the investigation might have already ended. But the case is progressing.”

“What takes one week in Germany can take six months in Portugal. I think the interest in the case in Portugal is just not that big, because no Portuguese person is involved. Also it does not shine a particularly good light on the Portuguese police, as they had totally different suspects. I think they would prefer to be left in peace. The co-operation with Britain is certainly notably better.”


Evidence being investigated includes a confession Christian B. made to a pal and phone analysis showing he was at the Ocean Club when the toddler vanished.

When people have asked this previously, I find that the answers are usually still pretty common. Karlie Guse, Brianna Maitland, etc. But what are some of the even less covered disappearances that deserve more attention?

One particularly spooky case is of Wanda Faye Walker, who went missing in 2016, 17 years after her daughter (Laresha Deana Walker) also mysteriously went missing without a trace. Both had experienced car trouble, then were never seen again. Authorities believe the two cases are unrelated. What are the chances that two relatives go missing under somewhat similar circumstances? The chances seem incredibly low.

Another case that interests me is Ebrahim Pouldar. We went missing in Los Angeles, but a car he was borrowing was found in northern suburban San Diego near a lagoon (around a 100 mile/2 hour drive from his apartment). This case is near me, which is why it intrigues me. The location his car ended up in is incredibly random, particularly for someone not from the area. There also aren't many places to go missing around there. There are tons of neighborhoods, busy streets, malls, restaurants, etc. It's not somewhere where you can wander into the wilderness and go undetected.

What uncommon missing person cases do you know about?

864,Personal-Proposal-91,[],1633830536,"From June 5, 1945-January 6, 1946, a serial killer known as the Lipstick Killer terrorized the streets of Chicago. He murdered Josephine Ross, Frances Brown and Suzanne Degnan in completely brutal fashion. The killer was believed to be a butcher of excellent status, even by licensed doctors. He communicated with the police in one of the murders, writing down in lipstick writing;

&amp;#x200B;

'""For heavens Sake catch me Before I kill more I cannot control myself""'

&amp;#x200B;

To many, he was never caught. Despite officially being apprehended.

&amp;#x200B;

William Heirens was his name. And this is his story.

&amp;#x200B;

Born in Suburban Chicago on November 15, 1928, Heirens was just 17 by the time the killings ended. He was not a butcher, nor was he insane. But he was a criminal, as he even admitted. So how did he get into this?

&amp;#x200B;

It's simple; police corruption and brutality.

&amp;#x200B;

The police didn't just torture Heirens, they tortured dozens of other suspects as well. Notably 65 year old Hector Verburgh. This is his recounting;

&amp;#x200B;

'Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms; they are sore. They had handcuffs on me for hours and hours. They threw me in the cell and blindfolded me. They handcuffed my hands behind my back and pulled me up on bars until my toes touched the floor. I no eat. I go to the hospital. Oh, I am so sick. Any more and I would have confessed to anything'

&amp;#x200B;

Hector later sued the Chicago Police for 15k, his wife gaining 5.

&amp;#x200B;

Heirens was locked in a jail cell for 6 entire days without food and water, being beaten to go along with it. They even tried to make him do a polygraph test, but was found to be too much in pain to do so. Later on, he tried to mimic a confession where an alter ego of his did the crimes. Despite being doused in truth serum, Heirens never admitted to doing any of the crimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The handwriting of Heirens did not match that of the lipstick wall writing. The police found prints at the crime scenes that belonged to Heirens, but also belonged to 65% of the population. His prints did not match the Brown murder. However, the FBI stated a few days later that Heirens had a fingerprint smudge on the doorhandle of the crime scene. In 1996, the FBI formally concluded that Heirens did not write anything associated with the Lipstick Killer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heirens' lawyers felt that he was guilty, and told him to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. Heirens agreed, despite the prosecution not even believing he would be able to be convicted! He was then sentenced to three life sentences with the possibility of parole. 

&amp;#x200B;

29 inconsistencies have been found between Heirens' recollection of the crime and the actual police reports themselves.

Something I try to do with cases that come to mind now and then (as I'm sure everyone here does) is to try and think of an angle that seems underexplored somehow- not necessarily original, but that no one has really discussed it in depth.

So St Louis Jane Doe. A refresher of the case can be found on Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Jane_Doe and The Unidentified Wiki https://unidentified.wikia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Jane_Doe_(1983)

My theory is what I will call ""The Sharon Marshall Theory"": when police were originally investigating St Louis Jane Doe's identity, they naturally focused on a specific age range of missing kids to see if any were her. As turned out to be the case with Sharon aka Suzanne Sevakis, I think there's a big possibility St Louis Jane Doe was originally ""taken"" - not necessarily in the sense of being kidnapped, but some kind of arrangement that authorities were not aware of or would not have approved of. St Louis was not neglected in any obvious sense (she was well nourished and had painted nails), but that doesn't mean abuse of another kind wasn't happening long before her life was so violently taken from her.

The obvious issue with this scenario is that she may never have been officially reported missing. So where people would need to focus is on anyone missing a young relative from the 70s who just hasn't surfaced - a second cousin, a half sister. Posts on Facebook etc. Despite a good deal of Keystone Kops bullshit later on involving psychics, I absolutely think this is solvable. Likely through genetic DNA, but looking for any young African American girls relatives can't seem to locate who dropped off the map in the 70s could be the lead needed.

The following day her car was found “in a parking lot near the college mall”, but as a former IU student I can tell you that the KMart parking lot IS a parking lot close to the college mall, the malls parking lot actually budded up against KMarts on the east side, so idk if that’s the parking lot it was found in or what 🤷‍♀️ anyways, her car was found with presumably no evidence as I can’t find a single mention of the contents of her car.  The same day her car was found, Vickie’s naked body was found face down in a water filled ditch on an access road to McCormick’s Creek State Park which is on the route to Terre Haute, about 16 miles north-east from where her car was found. Investigators found evidence of sexual assault and indications that she was strangled, as well as 2 letters KN carved into her abdomen. Her personal belongings were never found and the scene showed no signs of a struggle so investigators believe this was simply the dump site. Vickies death received very little media attention because the public had little sympathy for a divorced mother who was known to go out to bars in the area. Due to the lack of evidence, and interest it seems, vickies case went cold.

Then I moved on to the second oldest case. 
Sept. 12 1977 Ann Harmeier was driving south bound on IN-37 to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana when her car overheated due to a faulty thermostat, causing her to pull over. Her car was found 15 hours later when her mother and the families reverend came across it while they were out looking for her after she failed to make a scheduled call home to her Reverend. The car was locked with its hood up (and I believe the flashers but could be misremembering on that one) with no sign of Ann anywhere. Ann  wouldn’t be found for another 36 days despite her disappearance making national news. Her body was found by a farmer who was out harvesting and spotted her between 2 rows of corn. She was roughly 4 1/2 miles from where her car was found and approximately 3 miles off of IN-37. Her jeans and underwear were pulled down around her ankles, her red IU shirt was up around her neck, she was gagged with her hands tied behind her back using one of her shoe laces, and her other lace was used in conjunction with her hairbrush as a makeshift garrote that was used to strangle her. Her purse and it’s contents were found spilled out about 10 feet away from the body.

The family was told for many years that they believed Ann’s killer was an Indiana man named Steven Judy, who was found guilty of murdering a mother and her 3 children after signaling for her to pullover, claiming something was wrong with her car and offered his assistance. He disabled her car, offered her and her kids a ride, but instead lead them to a creek where he drowned the kids and raped and strangled their mother. But eventually it was discovered that Judy was incarcerated at the time of Ann’s disappearance.

This one sticks with me because the locations on IN-37 where both her car and body were found are within 5-10 miles of my childhood home where my parents still live. I also graduated from Indiana University and drove that exact same path going back and forth from home to school, just like she did so her story has always stayed with me. The case is actually being looked into again as of 2019 due to a different cold case from Sept. 15 1972 of another college student (from ISU in terre Haute, about an hour 20 away from IU in Bloomington) Pam Milam, 19, who was also bound, gagged, and strangled with her own items as well as sexually assaulted. Investigators for the ISU case worked with Parabon using a stain from the victims blouse left by the perpetrator to ID an Indiana man by the name of Jeffrey Lynn Hand. Talking with Hands widow, detectives learn that from 1970-1971 they were living in Terre Haute where Hand was working as a mailman for the US postal service, and from 1972-1973 Hand was working for a records company that had him delivering music records throughout the Midwest. After talking with the family, detectives start looking into Hands past, where they learn about the time he was found innocent by reason of insanity for the kidnap and brutal murder of Jeff Thomas in June of 1973. Thomas and his wife were hitchhiking back from Chicago to Evansville when Hand picked them up and offered them a ride, but instead taking them to his secluded farm where he was living alone while his pregnant wife and kids still lived in the home they shared, just north of their destination. Here he pulled a gun and forced the husband to tie up his wife, then Hand tied the husband and bound the wife’s feet with wire. He locked the wife in a grain bin and took the husband to raise $400 in ransom money. When they left, the wife escaped and ran to the neighbors to call 911. Police waited for hand to come back, when he did he was alone, at which time he was arrested promptly. Officers found a revolver, a rifle with a sawed off barrel, and a hunting knife with a 5 in blade in his car. At the police station, Hand told detectives that Jeff Thomas was dead and he would take him to the body. Hand took them to a secluded area where Thomas’s body was found just 41 feet off of the road. He had been shot in the face (with a different gun than the one hand used to subdue them earlier), he had 8 stab wounds to the chest and upper abdomen, and his throat was slit. Hand was found innocent by reason of insanity after only 2 hours of deliberation and “sentenced” to 10 days in a state mental hospital, after which he was released after being in custody for a total of 3 years. 
15 months later, Ann Harmeier would disappear.
4 months later Jeffrey Hand died during a police chase after he abducted a young woman from the men’s department of a shopping center at gunpoint. A large hunting knife was also found in the car after his demise.

There’s so many details I left out trying to make it as to the point as I could. But I would love to open up a discussion and hear your thoughts and theories!",Will 2 unsolved strangulations of Indiana women reveal a Serial Killer?
868,Personal-Proposal-91,[],1633754656,"Hello everyone, I'm here to discuss the prime suspect on the Zodiac Killer case, Arthur Leigh Allen, and shall review the facts to see whether or not the Zodiac Killer was truly right before our very eyes and just happened to get away.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's begin with analyzing Allen's greatest critic; Don Cheney. Now, I don't plan on using Mr. Cheney's testimonies to any real use because, well, he has a clear bias toward Arthur Leigh Allen. I shall mostly look at hard evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what could link Allen to the killings? Many things.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, both Hartnell and Mageau identified him as their attacker. This is factual and can be backed up by documents. Mageau was especially passionate about Allen's guilt, whereas Hartnell remained cautious. There are also controversial reports, not sure if true nor false, that Arthur went to Lake Berryessa on the day of the murder, but decided to go up the coast instead. This is the same report he stated that he had bloody knives, however I remain skeptical of both of these reports.

&amp;#x200B;

The only time a Zodiac letter came outside of San Francisco was when Arthur was arrested outside of San Francisco. The very same day, in fact. He had the same foot size as the suspect, he was found to enjoy the story 'The Most Dangerous Game', and he even had bombs in his basement on 1991. The Zodiac once said; '''**What you do not know is whether the death machine is at the sight or whether it is being stored in my basement for future use**' and '**Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer + 1 gal of stove oil &amp; dump a few bags of gravel on top + then set the shit off + will positivily ventalate any thing that should be in the way of the blast**""' Arthur Leigh Allen had bomb diagrams containing oil and ammonium nitrate, as well as pipe bombs.

&amp;#x200B;

But what eliminates Arthur? Well, good question.

&amp;#x200B;

DNA eliminates Arthur, as do fingerprints and handwriting samples. However, the DNA on the stamps are not conclusive in any way, as they could be from a mailman. Fingerprints can be unreliable, but it's perhaps the greatest case against Arthur. Handwriting samples can also be manipulated, as said by the man who tested Arthur Leigh Allen's writing.

&amp;#x200B;

Detective George Bawart stated; **""The only reason I look in that direction and I am 95 percent sure it was him, is because so many coincidences point in his direction. What really bothers me about this case is that we were ready to charge Arthur Leigh Allen, with the idea in mind that it would be taken to trial so that 12 jurors could make that determination. But he died before we could do that"".**

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I'm having a hard time truly coming to grips with Arthur. I think it's possible he did atleast one of the killings, but they all point to one man. What do you guys think?

874,Rustamchik228,[],1633707219,"30 years ago, on October 6, 1991, the famous Soviet singer Igor Talkov was shot dead at a concert in St. Petersburg. This crime is considered to this day the biggest in the history of Russian show business, and the course of its investigation raises many questions: although at the time of Talkov's death there were only a few people with him, the investigators could not solve the case and expose the murderer.

Igor Talkov's childhood was spent in the Tula Oblast. The parents of the future musician (his father belonged to an old noble family) at one time fell into the millstones of Stalin's repressions and met in the village of Orlovo-Rozovo, Kemerovo Oblast, where both served time and played in an amateur theater of the local GULAG. After their release, they tried to return to Moscow, but the former political prisoners were denied housing, and the couple settled in the village of Gretsovka, Tula Oblast.

Igor was born there on November 4, 1956. The boy showed love for music since childhood: in addition to the usual school, he attended a music school, learned to play the button accordion. Igor had abilities for it: having mastered the button accordion, he learned to play the piano, guitar and mastered the drum kit. In high school, Talkov founded his first musical group, called ""Guitarists"" (according to other sources - ""Past and Thoughts""). At the same time, he began to write songs; his debut works were the compositions ""Dusha"" (Soul) and ""Mne ne jal'"" (I'm Not Sorry).

Another passion of Talkov was theater: although he was embarrassed to go on stage in a school drama club and only watched performances, he still dreamed of an acting career. Having received an academic certificate, Igor shortly studied in a local school on a locksmith, but dropped out and went to Moscow. There he tried to enter the theater institute but failed the literature exam.

After the failure with the theater institute, Talkov tried to study at the pedagogical institute and the institute of culture, but in the end, he dropped out of both educational institutions. For some time he was a member of the Wrappers musical group, and besides music he was also fond of political activities, sympathizing with the dissident movement. In 1975, on Tverskaya Square, Talkov made an accusatory speech against the political leadership of the USSR. It was an equally bold and reckless move. In those years, the authorities reacted extremely painfully to any criticism. Igor escaped criminal prosecution by joining the army. In the understanding of the punitive authorities, the educational impact of the army service was comparable to that of a colony, and in many respects they were right.

Talkov served in the engineering troops, where he finally decided to devote his life to music and created the group ""Zvezdochka"" (Little Star). After demobilization, Talkov went to Sochi, where he joined the musical group of Alexander Barykin. But he had to perform mainly in restaurants, and such “creativity”, despite a good income, sickened Talkov. Leaving everything behind, the singer returned to Moscow.

For some time he performed with different groups, but his performance at the Song of the Year festival with the composition Chistye Prudy in 1987 made him famous. Soon Talkov formed his own collective ""Spasatelniy Krug"", with which he went on a tour of the USSR. A little later, a clip for the ""Rossiya"" song was shot, which secured the status of a star to the musician. With the beginning of active concert activity in the life of Talkov, there were more conflict situations. In most cases, these were working moments related to the organization of performances, but in early October 1991, Talkov's wife Tatyana witnessed two strange telephone conversations with her husband. In the first Igor asked: *“Are you threatening me? Are you declaring a fight against me? Okay, I accept it.""* In the second, he dropped a cryptic phrase: *“Are you bothering me again? There is nothing left to live”*. However, Talkov refused to answer the question of his wife who called him.

On October 6, 1991, a stellar concert was held at the Yubileiny Sports Palace in St. Petersburg, in which most of the popular singers took part. Among the singers was Talkov; according to the plan, he went on stage at 16:20, before Oleg Gazmanov closing event. And before Talkov, the singer Aziza was supposed to perform. But then her lover, 28-year-old Igor Malakhov, decided to intervene in the matter. According to some reports, he wanted to knock out a more honorable place for his lady of the heart - closer to the final of the concert, changing the order of her performance with Talkov. However, according to Aziza, no one changed the order on purpose, but she arrived at Yubileiny late and simply did not have time to prepare for going on stage.

Trying to change the order, Malakhov turned to a radio engineer, who sent him to negotiate with Talkov's representatives in his dressing room. Talkov was preparing to perform in the dressing room when Malakhov knocked on him with an offer to perform before Aziza. Talkov took the news calmly, but the director of the singer Valery Shlyafman, who joined the group at the end of the summer of 1991, was outraged.

By the way, by that time Valery had already taken on the role of a brawler - some members of the ""Spasatelniy Krug"" group noted that with the arrival of a new director on tour, petty quarrels and clashes became more frequent. According to Shlyafman, Malakhov immediately began to be rude to him: *""In response, he literally told me: “Listen, Vasya, do as I said if you don't want any disastrous outcome. I am a big businessman in the shadow economy, so do what I say.""""* Then two bodyguards of the singer joined in, one of whom tried to hit Malakhov in the groin. But Malakhov, a seasoned kickboxer, escaped the hit, after which the opponents went out into the corridor. Having exchanged a couple of phrases with the guard, Malakhov was about to leave, but then Shlyafman caught up with him. Valery began to tease Malakhov, hinting at his cowardice. Malakhov immediately took out his Nagant, which, as it turned out later, had three cartridges. Shlyafman, who was watching this, rushed back to Talkov with a shout: *""Igor, give me something - he got a gun!""*

Talkov pulled out his gas pistol - he had acquired a weapon at the beginning of the year for his wife, but suddenly decided to take it with him to a performance at Yubileiny. Then the singer, accompanied by bodyguards, left the dressing room and fired a couple of shots towards Malakhov, but due to the long distance and low-quality cartridges, this did not cause any harm to the opponent.

According to other sources, Talkov did not shoot at all but began to beat Malakhov, who was twisted by bodyguards, with the handle of a gas pistol, on the head. Squeezed on both sides on the floor, Malakhov managed to pull the trigger of the revolver twice, one bullet hit the floor, the other into the box with the equipment. Aziza ran to the noise: although she was pregnant, (as a result, she lost her child) she rushed to protect Malakhov and threw her jacket over his head.

Soon after that, a fatal shot struck in the direction of Talkov - before that, eyewitnesses heard the sounds of several misfires. According to witnesses, Igor said *“How painful!”*, took a couple of steps, and slid to the floor on the mirror hanging on the wall. Bleeding Talkov was taken to the dressing room, where a nurse from the Yubileiny first-aid post came running. She injected the singer with several drugs, and the singers who ran to the noise called an ambulance. 12 minutes after arriving at the scene, the doctors ascertained the death of Talkov; the bullet passed through the wrist (the singer instinctively tried to protect himself from the shot) and hit the heart area.

According to some reports, a few minutes before the ambulance arrived, two guys approached Talkov, who introduced themselves as students of a medical university. They began to give the singer a heart massage, which was unacceptable with such a wound - the bullet from their actions entered even deeper into his body.

After the fatal shot, the concert was interrupted, and the presenter turned to the audience: *""Stop the music! Now, please, a minute of silence. All militia in the hall should urgently cordon off the Yubileiny, as they just shot at Igor Talkov. Backstage there was a shot at Igor Talkov. If there are emergency doctors or any doctor in the hall, please come to me here on stage. Urgently!""*

Fearing disturbances, the doctors did not say that the patient could not be helped, they put Talkov's body on a gurney, put an oxygen mask on him, and took him away in an ambulance. In Hospital No. 10, the body was first taken to the intensive care unit, and then taken to the morgue.

Farewell to the singer took place on October 9 at the Moscow Palace of Youth, Talkov was buried at the Vagankovsky cemetery. Malakhov was the first to be suspected of murdering the singer, against whom Shlyafman actively testified: *""Malakhov, who was lying down, twisted, raised his hand with a pistol, fired one or two shots at point-blank range at Talkov, while he was standing nearby. Talkov somehow bounced against the wall.""* But the investigators did not manage to detain the suspect right away: he fled from the Yubileiny before the arrival of the police. By the way, the police did not find the revolver from which Talkov was killed.

According to Aziza's recollections, when she got to her feet, she noticed that Shlyafman rushed into the dressing room. She followed him and saw how Valery threw a revolver into the toilet bowl to hide it. But Shlyafman claimed that he put the pistol on the tank, and the singer took it and handed it to her director, who handed the weapon to Malakhov. He, according to this version, got rid of an important piece of evidence: he disassembled the revolver and threw its parts into the Fontanka, Moika, and Neva. On October 10, Malakhov was put on the all-Union wanted list, but six days later he himself came to Petrovka No. 38. He did not deny that he had brought a revolver to the concert hall but did not admit his guilt in the murder of Talkov. 

After interrogating Malakhov, they released him on recognizance not to leave. After a series of examinations and interrogations of witnesses, the detectives were forced to admit that Malakhov was telling the truth and had no direct relation to the death of the singer. By the way, situational expertise played a big role in this: it showed that Talkov was shot from a standing position, but Malakhov was lying on the floor at the time of the shot. Nevertheless, the owner of the revolver was punished for illegal carrying of weapons: in May 1994, a district court sentenced him to 2.5 years of suspended imprisonment. In 1998, Malakhov changed his last name to Rus, sold his Moscow apartment, and for almost 20 years lived as a hermit in a small forest house in the Moscow Oblast. He died in 2016: due to cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes, Igor was practically immobilized, but until the end of his life he continued to write songs, poems, and books for children.

The next suspect was Valery Shlyafman. However, when the investigation became closely interested in him, he had already emigrated through Ukraine to Israel. After a while, he changed his name to Valery Vysotsky and got a job as a manager at a travel agency. During a search in the Moscow apartment of the director's common-law wife, they found the shirt he was wearing on the day of the crime. The traces of gunpowder and drops of blood belonging to Igor Talkov were found on it. Soon, investigators charged Shlyafman in absentia with causing death by negligence. They tried to get their Israeli colleagues to cooperate in the investigation. An investigator from St. Petersburg Oleg Blinov even specially flew to the city of Ramat Gan, but he was not allowed to interrogate Shlyafman: *""At the Israeli consulate, I asked for assistance in transporting this person and conducting the interrogation. To which I was told: if you want to violate the law of the State of Israel, you will be prosecuted. Because law enforcement officers of other states cannot act on the territory of Israel.""* Moreover, Israeli law enforcement officers considered that the evidence collected in Russia against Shlyafman was not enough for extradition. Valery denied that he had fled to Israel to escape criminal prosecution: according to him, he did not keep secrets from his departure and even warned Talkov's widow about it.

A few years later, Shlyafman received a paper from Russia, according to which the investigation was terminated due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. However, he did not sign the document, because he wanted to be found innocent. At the same time, he stubbornly called Igor Malakhov guilty of the crime: *""For me, the culprit was found on the day the tragedy struck. But the evidence has disappeared, so today it is unrealistic to find the killer. And it was like this: Malakhov was beaten on the back of the head, he automatically reached for the pistol and fired.""*

Producer Mark Rudinstein also adhered to a different version - about premeditated murder: according to him, businessman Ismail Tagi-Zade was involved in the death of Talkov. He produced *Tsar Ivan the Terrible* 1991 movie, where Talkov starred. On the set, the producer and the actor had a conflict - according to some reports, the producer insulted Talkov's wife. According to other information, after the change of director, the genre of the film changed, with which Talkov did not agree. After that, Igor refused to voice his role. At the Moscow premiere of the film, Talkov went on stage and, falling to his knees, turned to the audience: *""I have two requests for you. Firstly, forgive me for taking part in this anti-Russian, anti-Orthodox, blasphemous movie. Secondly, don't watch this movie.""* After that, Tagi-Zade allegedly harbored a grudge and decided to liquidate Talkov, ordering him to Malakhov, a member of one of the organized criminal groups. There was also such a version: taking advantage of the turmoil, Talkov was shot by a sniper hiding behind the scenes.

However, at various times, not only individuals but also entire structures were suspected of involvement in the murder of Talkov. For example, one of the nationalist organizations was associated with the crime: there was a version that its participants decided to eliminate the singer to then create from him the image of a patriot who suffered for the truth.

Talkov's lyrics are mostly about love, but also contain a social critic of the Soviet regime. He was shot dead in 1991. So, KGB also was ssociated with the murder of Talkov: allegedly dissatisfied with his anti-Soviet creativity, the Chekists decided to eliminate the ""enemy of the state"" by order of the country's leadership. Talkov himself spoke about the intrigues of the Communist Party: *""For a long time, the communists were approaching me to find my Achilles' heel, to discredit me somehow. And cut off my tours, because I gathered large audiences ... They had to somehow hook me up a little.""*

In November 2018, Talkov's wife appealed to the investigating authorities with a request to recognize her as a victim and to reopen the investigation, which was soon done. However, this time the matter reached a dead end: it was still impossible to interrogate Shlyafman. The lawyer of the Talkov family insisted that the case be brought to court in any case, and the director's actions were re-qualified to clauses a murder out of hooligan motives, committed in a generally dangerous way. But progress in this matter has not yet been achieved.

""Iowa police have solved the 50-year-old cold case murder of a 17-year-old girl through DNA evidence. 

Cedar Rapids police have identified Maureen Brubaker Farley’s killer as George M. Smith who died in 2013 at the age of 94. 

Two teenage boys found Farley’s body in a wooded ravine in what is now Tait Cummins Park, on Sept. 24, 1971. She was partially clothed with no shoes. An autopsy report determined she had been sexually assaulted and struck in the head, causing a skull fracture that killed her.

Farley’s mother, Mary Brubaker, long suspected Smith was responsible, having written to police six months after her daughter’s death. Smith was an acquaintance of Farley’s at the diner where she worked. He also worked at a liquor store near her apartment.

Police interviewed Smith in 1971 but did not have enough evidence to charge him or any other suspect. 

DNA technology unavailable at the time of Farley's killing allowed police to confirm that Smith was Farley’s killer.""

I am glad to see another case solved by DNA and forensic geneology, and hope it is adopted further by law enforcement.

876,chickenwinganxiety,[],1633646014,"Thatcher, Arizona was a small town where people would leave their doors unlocked and windows open at night, and everyone knew everyone. People felt safe living there, so when 29 year old single mother Mary Ann Holmes was brutally raped and murdered in her home in front on her two children it was a major shock to the locals of this tiny town, and grizzly details of her death live on..

# The Murder

In the early morning hours of July 9th, 1995, someone crept into the unlocked back door of single mother Mary Ann Holmes's home and brutally attacked her. She was a single mother to two daughters, who were aged four years old and eighteen months old respectively. Mary Ann's clothes had been forcefully cut off of her body and she was bound with handcuffs and rope and gagged. She had been sexually mutilated and was raped both vaginally and anally by an unknown object and also by the assailant himself. She had been struck in the head multiple times by a sharp object during and after the torture, possibly the same object she had been raped with. It was later determined that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. This had all happened while her two young children watched from the bed, just a couple of feet away from the murder scene which occurred in the small living area. Mary Ann's four year old daughter was also stripped of her clothing and bound, however was spared any sexual assault. She sat with her mothers dead body for some time trying to wake her before running to the neighbours home while still naked and bound to get help. Once the police arrived, they found poor Mary Ann handcuffed, gagged and curled up fetal position on the living room floor with blood everywhere. The eighteen-month-old child was next to her mother and both girls were left physically unharmed by whoever killed their mother Mary Ann, but of course, their mental anguish caused by this evil encounter would follow them forever. 

# The Evidence

There was very little for police to go of in this case, and nothing seemed to fit together. The four-year-old daughter drew a gruesome picture of the crime scene, which when compared to photos of it, it was almost identical. In the drawing, Mary Ann was laying on the ground with what looked like a knife or hatchet stuck in her head, with blood pooling all around. It was a terrifying scene. 

Mary Ann's four year old child was interviewed, but not much could be gathered from it. The child was too traumatised and too young to give a detailed account. Not a huge amount is known or documented of what the child told detectives, but one thing she said is that the intruder was 'huge' and that he was ' A lion man ' detectives were unsure what she meant by this. 

Police discovered a bloody shoe print at the scene that was roughly a man's size 11 or 12. Reportedly a fingerprint was found on the handcuffs and a small trace of DNA was found, but neither were enough to produce any real leads and no matches were found. 

Mary Ann Holmes also had a yard sale the day before she was killed She had made a small amount of money at this sale that was stolen during the attack. Her neighbour, Kaye Turner, believed that there was a connection between the murder and the yard sale, yet still no evidence leads to anything. Did the killer attend the yard sale? Did they scope out her house? Did they realise she was single mother alone with her children?

Mary Ann's backdoor was also broken, she had been asking her landlord to fix it for some time, yet it was never completed. This was how the killer ultimately gained entry. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Suspects

There were three main suspects in Mary Ann’s murder. David Black, John Bursee, and Philip Turley.

**David Black’s** father owned the house that Mary Ann was renting. Mary Ann had given him money to fix the back door since it wouldn’t lock, but the door was never fixed. It was the same door that the killer used to get into the house. David Black also had long blonde hair and a beard, which may have matched the four year old daughters ' Lion Man ' description of the killer. David also started living in the home years after the murder, and became slightly obsessed with the case. He claimed living in the home made him feel 'closer' to Mary Ann. He is known to be very 'out there' and not mentally stable.

**John Bursee** was Mary Ann’s ex boyfriend who lived in Florida. Mary Ann was reportably very afraid of him. She had filed a police report after he called her and threatened that he was going to come back to Thatcher for her. After her death, police interviewed him but his alibi checked out and he was cleared.

**Philip Turley** was the third and most interesting person on the suspect list. He had a deep and unshakeable obsession with Mary Ann. Some sources say they dated at some point, but other sources say that they were just acquaintances who had no real connection. Turley told a family member that he was engaged to Mary Ann, but this was obviously not true. He also said that he had bought land in the town of Pima to build a dream house for them. He kept a detailed diary about his love for her. Past girlfriends of Turley were interviewed and stated he was violent and had an obsession with rough sexual activity and tying them up with rope and.....handcuffs.

Turley has been labelled the most likely suspect in the case, however he still has not been charged and still not enough evidence has been gathered to make a formal arrest. 

This case is still cold. Mary Ann's daughters and now adults and are still haunted by their mothers unsolved homicide. 

RIP Mary Ann Holmes

878,FogHawk,[],1633634015,"Many cases from the 1930’s to 1980’s often make it a point to highlight a potential suspect/victims usage of Marijuana. In older cases smoking weed is viewed as extremely immoral and a motivation for illegal activities. Many officers at the time would make assumptions based on Marijuana use, but were perfectly fine with Alcohol consumption. 

Do any old cases that made such assumptions come to mind ? And how do you view Marijuana specifically in regards to cases both past and present ? 

For decades teenagers and adults have smoked weed. Now with its legalization potentially on the horizon the stigma may be one step closer to being erased. I am completely against selling weed illegally and I am not talking about dealing. 

I do wonder how many times Marijuana usage was pointed to as a reason to suspect an individual or how often Marijuana usage was used to slander a victim. 

Reefer madness which was produced in 1936 is a great example of these attitudes. https://youtu.be/u1pa4uGue90

Today the stigma against weed has been greatly reduced across the US. However some parts of the country are still adamant on keeping it illegal. I completely respect anyone who believes Marijuana should be illegal. It does have its cons. 

Are there any cases where you think Marijuana usage was blown out of proportion in regards to seriousness? 

Are there any cases that were attributed reefer madness or being high as a motivation ? 

How do you think the stance and view is today ?",How does Marijuana use in a Case effect how you view a Suspect/Victim ? Many cases from the 30s-80s make a lot of assumptions based on rumored Marijuana use age.

PARIS — The sudden suicide of a retired French policeman and subsequent tests of his DNA have confirmed that he was the notorious “le Grêlé,” a serial killer and rapist responsible for at least four murders and six rapes in Paris in the 1980s and 1990s.
François Vérove, 59, of La Grande-Motte, was due to be questioned in the unsolved case the day he died, according to French authorities. His body was found Wednesday in a rental property in the resort of Le Grau-du-Roi, located about 485 miles from Paris on France’s Mediterranean coast.
Didier Seban, a lawyer representing the families of Vérove’s alleged victims, told the BBC that Vérove left a note suggesting he was the person behind the string of violent crimes, which included the 1986 rape and murder of 11-year-old Cécile Bloch.","Retired French cop’s DNA, suicide lead to his identity as serial killer after 35 years"

882,crime-solver,[],1633609912,"Twenty-one-year-old Mary Carter and her two children were waiting for a bus at the intersection of Madison Rd, and Erie Rd, Cincinnati at about 11.30 am on August 16, 1980.  When the bus arrived, the driver told her that the bus didn’t stop at her desired destination.

Mary and her four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter headed towards Vista Avenue.  A man in a blue pickup truck stopped and offered the family a ride.

At around 1.45, a woman who lived in Cincinnati East End saw two small children, looking very distressed, walking on the sidewalk outside her house. When the woman asked the children what the problem was, they replied that they couldn’t awake their mother, and they showed her where Mary, was.

The woman took the children to the nearest fire station.  The firefighters alerted the police.   A group of children had earlier discovered the body of a young woman in the area.  The area, Mary was found, was known, as prostitutes used to take their clients there.

Mary was found in a ditch.  According to the autopsy, she was not sexually assaulted.  She was strangled to death manually or with a ligature.

**Children witness murder**

The children told police that they were picked up by a man in a blue pickup truck.  They have never seen or met the man before.  The man let them all out of the truck near Eastern Avenue, at which point they were unable to wake up their mother.

Detectives were furious about the fact that someone had killed Mary in front of her two small children. They worried that the children would be psychologically damaged from the event and were determined to find the man responsible. With little to go on, they appealed to the public for help.

**The description of the truck**

Several motorists had seen Mary and her children getting into the truck.  They contacted the police and gave the description of both the truck and its driver:

The truck was a midnight blue 1976 or 1977 Ford pickup truck with a 2 to 3-inch white stripe painted on each side. The truck had a black steering wheel and a light blue interior; it also had a single rear window, an aluminium rear bumper, and chrome box rails on each side of its truck bed.  The truck may have had a white, removable camper cap over the bed of the truck.

**The description of the man**

A white male 25-35 years of age, of average height and weight, with either blond or white hair and a dark moustache. He had dark eyes and an olive complexion.  The suspect may have been wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, that buttoned down the front, white trousers and brown shoes.  He was described as neat in appearance.

A composite of the man along with a photo of a similar car was released to the public.  Even though police investigated over 100 cases of blue pickup trucks, they were never able to find the car or the man.

Mary was in the process of getting a divorce at the time of her murder.  Police questioned her ex-husband, but he was 300 miles away at the time of the murder.

On the previous evening, she had sold a washer and a dryer from her old house, since she would be moving to a new house after the separation.  Police wanted to examine whether the man who bought the appliances was the driver of the blue truck, but they were never able to determine who the buyer was.

In the following years,  there was an aged progression sketch of the suspect released to the public. Unfortunately, Mary’s killer has never been identified.

883,TheColorOfYou,[],1633576082,"Who was the Dona Ana County Jane Doe?

I was just perusing Doe Network, and I found this 2003 Doe whose body was located in Dona Ana County, New Mexico.

She was 50-60 years old, Black, 5’5”, 134 lbs, and had a vertical scar on her abdomen.

What’s really odd about this case to me is that she was found with the following: Three sweatshirts, two T-shirts, blue sweater, gold colored poncho with fringe, black tank top, pink robe, swimsuit, camisole, blue shorts, orange shorts, long johns, gloves, multiple socks, leg warmers, blue denim overalls. Black high top tennis shoes. Am I misreading this, or was she wearing this many articles of clothing at once?? Or was she carrying these at the time of her death? It’s unclear on the site.

Furthermore, she was struck on a highway (Highway 227, mile marker 2). It doesn’t say whether it was a hit-and-run or if the driver reported it. It also doesn’t say whether it was accidental or not.

Are there any potential matches folks can think of? Because Black people make up such a small portion of New Mexico’s population, I’m guessing she may have been from Texas or another nearby state originally. Furthermore, why did she have so many posessions and articles of clothing with her? I’m guessing this meant she was homeless but I’m not sure.

From the article: 

The Cedar Rapids Police Department Cold Case Unit has successfully identified and confirmed suspect George M. Smith in the homicide cold case of Maureen Brubaker-Farley. The body of 17-year old Maureen Brubaker-Farley (DOB 07/04/1954) was found September 24, 1971, in a wooded ravine off Ely Rd SW.
Through years of investigation and with the use of DNA technology, investigators determined that the unknown suspect DNA profile developed in this case was that of George M. Smith. As a result of the investigation, the Homicide Cold Case of Maureen Brubaker-Farley will be closed, with no prosecution, as George M. Smith is deceased.

Chief of Police Wayne Jerman states, “No matter how much time has passed, our officers are committed to seeking out justice for all victims of violent crime as well as their families.  I am extremely proud of the generations of Cedar Rapids Officers that contributed to bringing this once cold case to a resolution.  I would also like to specifically recognize the contributions of our current Cedar Rapids Police Departments Cold Case Unit.  Those individuals are Investigator Matt Denlinger, retired DCI Special Agent JD Smith and retired CRPD Police Lieutenant Ken Washburn.” 

Case Synopsis

17-year old Maureen Brubaker-Farley (DOB 07/04/1954) moved to Cedar Rapids in the summer of 1971. She moved into an efficiency apartment at 522 10th St SE and began working at a local diner located at 836 First Ave NE. Farley was last seen alive on the morning of September 17, 1971. When Farley hadn’t arrived to work on September 20, her employer reported her as missing. Farley’s apartment was searched and found relatively undisturbed with her vehicle parked in the lot behind the building. At this point there was no evidence to suggest what happened to Farley.

On September 24, 1971, two teenage boys spotted Farley’s body lying on the trunk of an abandoned junk car in the wooded ravine just off Ely Rd SW near the landfill. That landfill site is now Tate Cummins Park.  Farley was partially clothed with no shoes and clean feet. The evidence shows that Farley was carried and placed at this location after she died. An autopsy was conducted and it was determined that Farley had been hit in the head causing a skull fracture which caused her death. The evidence also suggested that Farley had been sexually assaulted.

A variety of evidence was collected during a thorough investigation and numerous subjects were interviewed. These interviews included suspects, potential witnesses, friends and family. Detectives had identified a variety of potential suspects but were unable to find enough evidence to charge anyone. Without definitive evidence, this case grew cold.

In 2006, Detective Doug Larison began reviewing this case. Detective Larison found numerous items of evidence that were appropriate for DNA analysis.  One item included a swab collected from Farley’s body as part of the sexual assault examination. That item was processed and a complete male DNA profile was developed. Detective Larison began collecting DNA swabs from potential suspects to have those compared to the suspect profile. The suspect profile was also uploaded to the FBI DNA databased known as CODIS. No matches were found through traditional comparison or CODIS.

In 2017, the CRPD Cold Case Unit began reviewing this case for additional follow up. Additional DNA testing was conducted on the remaining evidence but no new DNA profiles were located. Investigators continued to locate male subjects listed in the case file and collect DNA from those subjects. By the spring of 2021, Investigators had eliminated more than 15 subjects through DNA comparison.

One suspect listed in the case that had not been eliminated was George Smith (Born in 1919). Although Smith was mentioned as a potential suspect, his DNA was not collected because he died in 2013, at the age of 94. Smith had been identified by multiple people as an acquaintance of Maureen Farley’s from the diner that she worked at. According to officer’s reports, in the month after Farley’s murder, Smith had gone to the Police Department on more than one occasion, suspiciously inquiring about the progress with the investigation. Smith was also known to operate a hauling service which may have had him making trips to the landfill located near Ely Rd SW where Farley’s body was found. Smith was also reported to have worked at the Party Lane liquor store, located at 1000 5th Ave SE, right next to Farley’s apartment. Smith was interviewed extensively in 1971 but he was not charged. Smith was offered and declined a polygraph at that time.

The Cedar Rapids Police Department Cold Case Unit was determined to identify whether or not George Smith could be identified as the suspect in this case or if he could be eliminated completely.  A confirmed relative of Smith was identified and a search warrant was written to collect DNA from that relative. The unknown male DNA profile developed from the crime scene and the buccal swabs collected from Smith’s relative were sent to DNA Labs International, in Deerfield Beach, Florida, for advanced analysis and comparison. On 09/24/2021, exactly 50 years after Maureen Brubaker-Farley was located, the Cedar Rapids Police Department reviewed the results of that comparison. It was determined that the unknown suspect DNA profile developed in this case was that of George M. Smith.  As a result of the investigation, the Homicide Cold Case of Maureen Brubaker-Farley will be closed, with no prosecution, as George M. Smith is deceased.

Maureen’s mother Mary Brubaker (age 86) of Sioux City Iowa, was notified that the person responsible for her daughter’s death was finally identified. Maureen’s father David Brubaker passed away in 2002. Maureen has four surviving siblings and one deceased sibling.

885,jayne-eerie,[],1633567470,"First post, please be gentle, etc.

Brittany Renee Williams was last seen in August 2000 in  Henrico, Va. There's a [recent post about her here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/nl3dl7/the_case_of_brittany_renee_williams_a_7_year_old/), but the basics are that the 7-year-old had been living in a medical foster home operated by one Kim Parker, who took custody of Brittany after the girl's mother died of AIDS. Brittany has been widely reported to also have the disease, but it's unclear if that's accurate. (We'll get to why in a second.) She'd also had several surgeries, including the implantation of a feeding tube.

After people realized the girl  was missing, Parker told several different stories about who she was living with and eventually ended up in jail on fraud charges for having cashed Brittany's Medicaid checks even after she no longer had custody of the girl. The obvious explanation, and what most people who look into the case assumed, would be that Brittany died from her medical issues and Parker concealed the death for her own financial gain. 

But it looks like that might not be the case. On October 5, a woman known as [Kaylynn Stevenson](https://www.nbc12.com/2021/10/05/i-am-brittany-renee-williams-woman-says-she-has-dna-prove-she-is-missing-cold-case-henrico-girl-after-21-years/) came forward and said she was Brittany and had been raised in Ohio by adoptive parents. 

Kaylynn does look quite a bit like Brittany and says she remembers the last name Williams, but of course that's not proof of anything. More persuasive are the medical scars on her body, which seem to correspond with Brittany's known scars. And finally, she took a lab DNA test that gave a 95.83% chance she was the half-sister of Brittany Williams' mother's only known daughter. The two have started to talk almost every day, and Kaylynn now goes by Brittany.

Heartwarming, and I hope for Kaylynn/Brittany's sake and the sake of people who loved Brittany it turns out to be true. But there are a lot of unanswered questions here. 

First off, if Brittany had AIDS, why doesn't Kaylynn?  There are a [handful of reports](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/140307-hiv-aids-baby-cured-medicine-science) of babies born with HIV who may have been cured by aggressive early treatment, but none of that was available in 1993 when Brittany was born. The best guess I have is that Kim Parker just plain made the AIDS up, but you'd think at some point someone would have tested the girl and not just taken her foster parent's word for it. Then again, Gypsy Rose Blanchard shows how much a narcissist with Munchausen's can get away with. 

Second, how did Brittany get from Kim Parker to her adoptive parents?  Parker had been complaining about the child for quite some time and even tried to give custody to Brittany's half-sister, so it's not hard to believe that she might have given the girl over in a black-market adoption. But that's still a hard scam to pull off for 21 years. Kaylynn's adoptive parents won't comment yet, which might mean guilt or might mean that they know it isn't true and are just trying to wait it out.

Third, how much does the DNA test prove? I don't think it was faked, but is it possible that Kaylynn is a previously unknown child of Brittany's birth mother? That would explain the family resemblance and why she's no longer HIV+, but not the scars or how she ended up with the Stevensons.

I did a little googling and found [this page](https://www.findmyfamily.org/Adoption/1991/Katherine-Brumfield/Karla-Brumfield/105443.htm) from Kaylynn's wife on a site for adopted people seeking their birth families. It gives Kaylynn's date of birth as November 25, 1991 -- about 15 months older than Brittany, who was born on March 20, 1993. Maybe the discrepancy could be explained by what fake birth certificates were available to the adoptive parents?  (The website also says Kaylynn's birth mother was 56 when she was born, which seems medically unlikely and might point to a doctored birth certificate.) 

So what do y'all think? Has Brittany been found, or could this be a hoax or a giant mistake?

[EDIT: There's some dispute as to whether Brittany was believed to have HIV or AIDS. However, most of the modern sources I used in writing this said AIDS. I haven't yet checked 2000-era sources.]","Brittany Renee Williams - Woman Says She Has DNA Proof She's ""HIV+"" 7-Year-Old Last Seen In 2001"

Robert Stacks narrations of certain cases made them much more ominous.  One such case would be the disappearance of Kari Lynn Nixon.  At the time NKOTB appeared in a segment urging Kari to contact her parents. The end result of her body being discovered made this all the more heartbreaking. There was a girl who looked quite similar to her spotted in the audience of a NKOTB music video. Ultimately it ended up not being Kari and her remains were discovered.

Another case that stood out to me is that of Cindy James. It was so bizarre and as I understand there was evidence pointing at her having some sort of mental illness going on at the time. There was also the strange threats left on her voice-mail and letters which point to the possibility of her ultimately meeting with foul play.

 I've linked to her wiki entry and an article detailing the harassment she received.

890,Arseofthepig,[],1633557301,"Hi folks!

Whilst my sinuses are no longer infected, they are still ridiculously swollen, so I'm still in pain and still not feeling great,. As such, poor April must wait a bit longer before I write up her case.

Now that's out of the way, onwards! For our next foray into the butt of the pig (also known as East Anglia), we are heading north from Suffolk, crossing the border and heading into Norfolk. Just in case you hadn't worked it out yet, Norfolk and Suffolk literally comes from 'North Folk' and 'South Folk'. We're an imaginative bunch.

Sorry for the detour, moving on! 

Whereas the other cases I have covered so far have been unsolved murders, the victims have all been identified. This case is different in as much as that the unfortunate victim remains a Doe, or in this case, the victim is listed as Cockley Cley on the Norfolk Constabulary website, after the village where her body was found. As a side note, you may she her referred to as ""The Duchess"" in some sources, as there is speculation that she may have been a sex worker from the Great Yarmouth area that worked under that name.

She was discovered on Tuesday 27th August 1974, by Andrew Head, a 19 year old tractor driver who was out for a walk in Cockley Cley (To give some of you an idea of the location and size of Cockley Cley, it is roughly three miles from Swaffham in the west of Norfolk, and in 2011, Cockley Cley only had a population of 232 in 103 households). Andrew had spotted a large dust sheet and upon lifting the sheet, he discovered the headless body of a young woman.

During the post-mortem, it was estimated that she had died in either the first or second week of August 1974. Her age was estimated to have been between 23 and 35, and her height between 1.52m (5""0') and 1.57m (5""2').

She was found wearing a pink Marks &amp; Spencer's nightdress. Her arms and legs had also been bound. With her body was some rope of an unusual composition, as it was made with four strands rather than the usual three or five strands. An expert in rope (I guess there is an expert for everything, but I must admit, it has never crossed my mind that there are rope experts) suggested that this meant it was produced for use in agriculture. The police were able to trace the manufacturers to Dundee in Scotland, but this provided no further leads. 

The police also attempted to find the source of the dust sheet that covered the body. A collector (again, there is a collector for everything, although whether they collected dust sheets or payroll machines I don't know) in the US notified the police that the dust sheet (which was embossed with the words National Cash Registers)  came from a payroll machine. They were even able to determine the exact model of payroll machine, which is impressive! However, further enquiry revealed that thousands of the machines had been made and exported, so once again the police reached a dead end.

The first inquiry was opened in 1975 and closed in 1975, during that time the police had spoken to 15,000 people and taken 700 statements, but no headway was made into either her identity or her murderer.

As Norfolk and Suffolk Constabulary regularly review their cold cases, her body was exhumed in 2008 to take a DNA sample, carry out a second autopsy, and to conduct isotopic analysis. The information gained from this autopsy was that she had given birth at least once, was right handed, had drunk Scottish water and her diet was rich in  fish and shellfish. The isotope analysis revealed that she probably grew up in central Europe, but which country exactly was not determined. Potential countries  include Denmark, Germany, Austria and northern Italy. Unfortunately, her name and murderer still remained elusive. 

As another side note, this case has helped solve a number of other unsolved cases. For example, in 2011, police identified 580 missing women as potentially being the victim, 540 being traced. Of these, 263 women were found alive,  52 were found to have passed away and 41 were eliminated through DNA taken from family members.

The police hope that a family member will one day be found. The police are also asking if anyone who knew ""The Duchess"" can help them with their enquiries as ""The Duchess"" disappeared in 1974, leaving all her possessions behind. She is believed to have come to Great Yarmouth from Denmark, there being a ferry link between the two. From the information gathered, ""The Duchess"" appeared to have worked as an escort, with many of her clients being lorry drivers, some of whom she joined for cross country journeys. The police do not know her real name so have been unable to rule her out as the body.

Unfortunately/fortunately (depending on your personal view), the UK does not yet utilise genetic genealogy (and may never), which I know is the first thing many will suggest as a way of determining her identity (more info here https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-genetic-genealogy-techniques-to-assist-with-solving-crimes/should-we-be-making-use-of-genetic-genealogy-to-assist-in-solving-crime-a-report-on-the-feasibility-of-such-methods-in-the-uk-accessible-version)

I sincerely hope that one day her identity will be discovered and her name returned. I obviously also hope her killer is discovered, but I am less optimistic about this… although I'll be delighted if I'm proved wrong!

892,CherryBlossom724,[],1633553328,"Beverly ""Babe"" Sharpman was born on December 10th, 1930. Her parents were Samuel and Nettie, and she had an older brother named Bernard (24). They lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

Another bit of information about Beverly is that her dream was to become a disc jockey one day and she sometimes spoke of maybe moving out to Los Angeles eventually. 

The day before Beverly left home, she went to her mother and said that she wanted to tell her something. However, Beverly quickly changed her mind and then went up to her bedroom. Nettie didn't think much of it at the time and let the matter drop.

The next day, September 11th, Beverly went to the high school and registered for senior classes. She came home at about 11:30am and told her mother that she was going to rest upstairs. Nettie left the house at around noon to go shopping and when she returned home, Beverly was no longer there. She was spotted later that day at the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Station in Philadelphia. She was said to be carrying a suitcase.

That evening, Beverly's parents received a telegram, presumably from her, that read ""Got married. Leaving town. Will not be back. Don't worry. Babe."" The wording is interesting, because it suggests that she was either already married when she walked out or that she got married that day. 

No one in Beverly's life, including her best friend Claire, had any idea that she was even interested in anyone, much less that she was seriously involved with someone. All of her known male acquaintances were looked into and none of them had gone missing or seemed to know anything about what was going on with Beverly. 

The police found out that she had quit her job at the radio distributing firm Trilling &amp; Montague the day before and that she had told her co-workers that she intended to move to Chicago. It was also discovered that Beverly had withdrawn $173 (a little over $2,000 today) from her savings account the day she went missing. Actually, she put in the request to withdraw the money a week before, but you typically had to wait two weeks to receive the money. However, she claimed that it was an emergency, so they made an exception for her and got the money to her a week early. 

No marriage record was found for her in any state, which means that she either didn't get married or that she got married using a fake name.

In 1948, Beverly's grandmother passed away. Her family hoped that she might see the obituary in the paper and show up for the funeral, but she didn't. 

In May, 1948, Beverly's family received a postcard which read:

&gt; Beverly Sharpman was working in Charleston, S.C., on April 8th, 1948. I spoke to her and I noticed she was a northern girl and didn't belong in the south. She was living in West St. with a girl named Bobby Wilson. She may have left Charleston by this time. - J. Edwards.

The Philadelphia Missing Persons Bureau investigated this lead, but they were unable to find any evidence that Beverly had either lived or was still living in Charleston. It's also unclear who Bobby Wilson was or how/when Beverly met her, if this story is true. 

Beverly's family was devastated by her disappearance and for years afterwards continued to put ads in the newspapers appealing to her to come home or to at least contact them. The saddest of which is probably this one from Nettie Sharpman, in 1950:

&gt; I want some word or sign that you are alive. Please contact me in your own way. I'll meet you anytime, anywhere. I'll sell my home and belongings, if necessary. I've got to find you.

Seven years after her disappearance, Beverly's parents received a strange letter from Fairless Hills, which is 30 miles northeast of Philadelphia. There isn't a lot of information available about what this letter said, except that it stated that they ""should seek Beverly through the help of foreign police"" and that it was signed ""Lee Davis"". A handwriting expert examined the letter and believed Beverly to be the author. Police investigated this lead, looking for Beverly in Fairless Hills, but came up with nothing. 

While her family had been in contact with police about Beverly's disappearance from very early on, they didn't officially file a missing persons report for her until 1954. 

Sadly, her parents and older brother have all since passed away, without ever having learned what happened to Beverly or why she chose to leave them behind. 

**Theories**

* Unplanned pregnancy. Maybe she was involved with someone, maybe an older (perhaps married?) man, and became pregnant. She could have left because she didn't want her family to know the truth and because she wanted to keep the baby. 

* She did get married, but to someone whom she knew her family wouldn't approve of.

* Another theory I came across was that she might have been a lesbian and that she ran off with a girlfriend. Maybe this Bobby Wilson? 

* She had been groomed by someone for a while, was lured away by this person and later murdered. 

I also find it interesting that no one else in the area is known to have gone missing at around the same time she left. So, if she did run off with someone, who was it? And how did she meet them?

The vehicle stops, turns around and comes back down the hill (at the same slow pace) towards their residence before Jake sees the shooter run out of the house holding a bag or a pillow case.  The shooter approaches the driver of the van and they talk for about 10 seconds before the shooter gets into the van and the van speeds off down the road.  Jake manages to flag another vehicle down to call 911 and when police arrive they find Betty dead in the mobile home.  Jake is airlifted to a local hospital and survives.  

It should be noted that Betty's family was not fond of Jake, and believed that he was abusive (physically and verbally) to her.  Jake was a junk yard dealer and dealt primarily in cash.  He also had several guns in their mobile home.  The police could never determine how much money was missing from the house, but all of the guns were located and accounted for.  They did say that a metal lock box (with up to $10,000 in it) which sat next to the bed in the master bedroom was missing. Jake was also cheating on her with multiple women at the time of the murder.  Jake quickly moved in with one of the women shortly after Betty's funeral.  The police also found that Jake did have a life insurance policy taken out on Betty and that he collected on that policy.  

But there *was* a second witness who confirmed that a white van almost drove him off of the road on the night of the murder.  This witness was the vehicle that Jake flagged down to call 911.  There was also the fact that Jake was shot twice in the face, and the shot to his neck caused him to lose a lot of blood.  He almost died at the hospital.  There was also a very similar murder committed just a few months prior to Betty's murder 15 miles east from where Betty and Jake lived.  Noble Wine, was an 81 year old man, who was also a junk yard owner, was found dead in a house fire on November 21st, 2008.  When the autopsy was performed, they found that he had been shot twice in the head with a small caliber pistol.  The same type of weapon used in Betty's murder and the shooting of Jake.  

Betty's family believed that Jake knows more than what he is telling them, because when they brought up the missing lock box to him, he acted as if he had no idea what they were talking about and that it never existed.  The insurance policy, and the way he acted after Betty's death also aroused their suspicions.  Most suspicious of all was the fact that the killer demanded money **and guns**, but of the various guns located in the residence (some of which were out in the open or easily accessible), none of Jake's guns were stolen.  

The police however, do not think Jake was involved, and they believe that the white van is the key to solving Betty's murder.  They also believe that the killer/s targeted both Jake and Nobile Wine because they were junk yard owners who dealt primarily in cash.  There was also a homicide from 2011 that police believe may be linked to Betty's and Noble Wine's murders, but the police are not releasing any information publicly about that one. 

So what do you think?  A home invasion robbery turned murder?  Or potential setup by Jake to collect on the life insurance policy?",Who Killed Betty Jane McClellan?

On the surface, this identification of Gary Poste, who died in 2018, may read as yet another monthly episode of that decades-in-the-running show known as ""The New &amp; Once Again Definitive Identification of the Zodiac"", the sister show to that other perennial favorite, ""The New &amp; Once Again Definitive Identification of Jack the Ripper"" (particularly with such statements as the alleged existence of a ""killer posse"").

However, a reason to possibly attach more attention to this latest claim is that it has not come - as it has tended to happen with most pseudo-identifications - from a single person who wants to convince a TV network to finance a series about his father-brother-uncle-aunt Zodiac, but from a group of actual retired investigators, ""The Case Breakers"", thus making the credence higher than with the usual claims (although, of course, this does not exclude the possibility of the ""looking for exposure"" motivation). Still, until additional material evidence is released, it remains one more drop in a rain of Zodiac claims - though possibly a heavier drop than most around it.

(Of interest is the fact that the strongest claimed ties are those between Poste and the murder of Cheri Bates, in which Zodiac's involvement - or lack thereof - is often strongly contested; as such, there is a possibility that perhaps Poste had something to do with that murder, but was not Zodiac).",Possible - albeit not highly likely - identification of Zodiac has been announced.

Some time ago, a relatively old story of the Jersey watcher just popped up in my head. When I first heard it, the story seemed to be creepy, and it was able to send shivers down my spine. However, when I turned to a sober analysis, it seemed pretty much like a hoax similar to the Amityville 'haunted' house, or it was just a joke of some stupid teenagers. 

Long story short, everything started when the Broaddus family moved into a beautiful old house located in a safe and peaceful neighbourhood somewhere in New Jersey (I do not remember the city already, sorry). Almost immediately, the family members started to discover mysterious letters from an unidentified writer, the content of which was, to say the least, terrifying. Simply speaking, the writer was presenting themself as a 'watcher', whose obligation is to monitor the house and take care of it. Such a tradition was an entrenched custom in their family, tracing its roots back to the 1920s. A mysterious writer also highlighted that kids are now 'the fresh blood of the house' and that they shall keep away from the basement. In addition, if I remember correctly, a person responsible for the mysterious correspondence was talking about something in the walls. Eventually, there were some suggestions that it could have been a family living nearby, which did not want the Broaddus here. Another hypothesis suggested that it was an old lady who lived with two of her mentally disabled children. And, finally, there was also a suggestion that everything was staged.

Thus, what do you think about that old creepy mystery? Did anyone notice any updated or suggested explanations?

Thank you and warm regards :)

904,Comprehensive-Fee195,[],1633466417,"I found one I wanted to contribute, her name is Diane Marie Schulte.

She went missing from Nampa, Idaho on March 25th, 1977. Her husband went to work that morning and when he returned home that afternoon, she was missing and a UPS package was found delivered on the front porch. Neighbors saw the UPS truck in the vicinity around 3 pm that afternoon. It appeared she had gone for a short walk that morning (part of her routine) and never returned. There were no signs of a struggle in the home and her wedding ring and watch were found on top of a desk. A pair of glasses was she wore was missing along with the clothes she was wearing that day. However, she hadn't taken her purse or money with her. She was a quiet, reserved person, it seems, and was content with reading, macramé, and her three pet cats. She had a degree in accounting and the couple was financially stable. Neighbors described them as a loving couple and the couple was in good spirits after celebrating their second wedding anniversary. Diane had no social life and only kept in touch with her grandmother. The day prior to her disappearance, she had complained of flu like symptoms and the couple had checked out books at the local library. She had an emotional phone conversation with her grandmother that same day, however details are unavailable as to why she was upset.

Her husband, Fred Schulte, reported her missing to the police. Diane was only 22 years old at the time and was last seen in a hooded sweatshirt, yellow shoes, and jeans. She was estranged from her parents (it seems she hated her parents due to incident from her youth where she was accused of fooling around with a married man in Florida; her parents treated her terribly because of the alleged affair). Oddly enough, her parents were scheduled to visit the couple and Diane was extremely anxious about the visit, asking Fred to call and cancel the arrangements. The UPS package, it turns out, was from her parents (it was a box of tangerines and oranges).  Police checked local cab companies, hotels, motels, hospitals, and even with the bus depot and the airports. No one reported seeing a woman matching Diane’s description.

Fred was scheduled to take a polygraph test regarding her disappearance on April 3rd, however a week prior however his body was found in Diane's 1975 Buick. He had been speeding when he shot himself in the head and the car ran down an embankment. When investigators went to his home, there were two suicide notes; the first was a will granting his estate to his father and the second was a note stating that he couldn't live without Diane and that she gave his life meaning. He had given up hope she would ever return home. The note then went on to reference the recent murder of another Nampa resident, Steven White, a ten year old boy found dead behind the LDS church in February that same year. Below is an excerpt of the note:

*""I challenge any sane, thinking person to spend one full day really observing this insane, absolutely absurd world we’re living in. Can you honestly say that you’re proud of it? That it makes any sense at all? That there is any justice in it? Diane Schultes and Steven Whites are being cut down left and right while the criminal elements (from the nickel-and-dime shoplifter to the politicians and businessmen that run the world) are free to ply their trades with virtually no fear of punishment.”*

Fred didn't claim responsibility for her disappearance in the notes and he has not been named a suspect. Some think there may have been domestic abuse that was kept secret, while others think that Fred was overcome with sadness and mental anguish at his wife's disappearance and wanted out of this world. When investigators searched his home and property, they found some oddities; an oval rug the couple owned was missing and a four inch hole had been cut from the living room drapes. They spaded the grounds of his property and didn't find any indications of a buried body. Could an intruder have wrapped her in the rug? The hole in the drapes could've been cut out because the cats were clawing at it and it was frayed, that's my guess. Or it could've been evidence.

This one just creeps me out, my gut tells me that maybe the husband was telling the truth. What happened to Diane? The most obvious explanation is that he killed her and was riddled with guilt so he ended his life, but apparently they had a solid relationship. Did she walk out of her life? I couldn't find out how old Fred was, but I'm assuming he was older than her. To this day, she's never been found.

906,moondog151,[],1633448969,"Kamenge is a small village located north of the city of Bujumbura, The economic capitol of Burundi. The village of Kamenge. Burundi is one of the worlds poorest countries and still trying to recover from a 12 year civil war that ended in 2005. The country also has a poor human rights record is considered dangerous for travel due to civil unrest and violent crime.

Bernardetta Boggian was a 79 year old Italian nun and a missionary working as part of the Xaverian Missionary Group and established her convent in the village of Kamenge. Bernadetta was from Italy's Ospedaletto Euganeo. It's unknown when she arrived in Burundi but in August 2013 she wrote a letter which reads as ""At this point of my journey , I continue my service to the African brothers, trying to live with love , simplicity and joy""

With her was Sister Lucia Pulici who was 75 years old and was from the town of Desio near Milan. She left Italy for missionary work in Brazil more spefically the Amazon at 21 years old before then going to The Democratic Republic of The Conga (then called Zaire) and then arrived in Burundi in 2007 where she stayed as a Nun, Midwife and a Nurse.

And lastly was Sister Olga Raschietti who was 83 years old and was from Vicenza in Italy. Little is known about her past life and how she ended up in Burundi but she became a nun at 22 years old.

The three had a headquarters in Parma, Italy where they would visit from time to time and report back about their experiences in Burundi. In one of their last statements in October, 2013 Lucia Pulici said ""I am returning to Burundi, at my age and with a weak and limited physique, which no longer allows me to run. day and night as before. Internally, however, I believe I can say that the enthusiasm and desire to be faithful to Jesus' love for me by making it concrete that the mission is always alive""

On September 7, 2014 Sister Bernadetta and Father Mario Pulcini the owner of the convent went to the Melchior Ndadaye-Bujumbura International Airport to pick up guest while Olga and Lucia stayed at the convent to prepare and get the place ready for the guest. When Bernadetta and Mario arrived back at the convent with their guest they found that the door was strangely locked.

No one answered the door despite how much they knocked so the two instead went to the sister's quarters where the nuns live and saw that not only was the door their closed but the curtains were also pulled so that they couldn't see inside. They tried calling the convent's phone but nobody picked up. Eventually with no other choice Father Mario resorted to breaking down the door.

They were greeted by a shocking scene as they were greeted by sister Olga laying dead in a pool of her own blood. In the room next door lay Sister Lucia dead as well with both of the women having had their throats slit and heads beaten with a stone. Father Mario quickly called the Burundian Police and then informed his superiors in Italy about the incident.

The police and security forces quickly arrived at the scene to investigate with a large crowd soon forming at the scene with the residents grieving for the deaths of the two nuns as the police patrolled the area. Father Mario urged the remaining Nuns (who were the guest picked up at the airport) not to sleep at the convent but they decided to stay anyway so that they can prey together and also having felt safe due to the large amounts of police patrolling the area.

Later that night or early the next morning Father Mario revived a call from Sister Bernadetta in which she stated that she was hearing noises in the convent and that she thought the killer may have returned or never left and remained hidden. Father Mario rushed back to the convent but was too late. He arrived to find Sister Bernadetta in her room decapitated. The murders outraged Burundi and even Pope Francis himself offered his condolences in regards to the tragedy and the Burundian government called this act ""Unimaginable Savagery"" and The Missionary referred to this as ""the tragic outcome of an armed robbery by a mentally unbalanced person"". Although some sources state that the nuns were raped with the police spokesman Helmegilde Harimenshi also stating this The Xaverian Missionary Group denies these claims. The Police also dismissed robbery being the motive as nothing seemed to be taken.

Two days later the police arrested a 33 year old man named Christian Claude Butoyi and claimed that he confessed and that the motive was revenge as according to Christian the church had stolen and occupied his land to establish the convent. However amongst the locals very few were convinced of Christian's guilt as he was known to be a beggar who suffered from severe mental issues and many thought the police were using Christian as a scapegoat. The police also claimed that Christian had a bloody stone, a key and the cellphone of one of the victims on him with the police claiming that the stone was the murder weapon and that he used the key to get inside the convent however the police never produced these items. Christian was also a desperate man who was starving and eating what ever he could so the locals didn't believe that he had the psychical strength necessary to kill the three nuns. Other inconsistencies is how it's unlikely Christian would be able to act alone, The nuns had been working in The Congo for nearly 8 years before this murder which contradicts Christian's confession and it doesn't explain how he was able to sneak back into the Convent to kill Sister Bernadetta. Christian was also supposed to be sent for a psychiatric evaluation at Burundi's only neuropsychiatric center but when the police were told to leave during the evaluation they refused and left with Christian.

Soon a new suspect would come out and if these sources are to be believed the police let the murderer carry out this crime on the orders of a man named General Adolphe Nshimirimana. Adolphe was a close ally of Pierre Nkurunziza and the head of Burundi's National Intelligence Service. Adolphe was accused by several NGO's and human rights organizations of extrajudicial killings and kidnappings. According to these sources the three nuns witnessed Adolphe and his engaging in acts of corruption and were going to speak of what they saw and were thus silenced.

Bob Rugurika the owner of a private radio station Radio Publique Africaine otherwise known as RPA had an anonymous man call into his station where he confessed on air that he had killed the three nuns on Adolphe's orders and that the secret the nuns stumbled upon is that Adolphe was involved in the smuggling of drugs and minerals from The Congo's South Kivu province and would pass his shipments off as being meant for the church, convent and parish in order to have customs taxes omitted Bob would then air this confession . The government denied all of these claims.

On January 20, 2015 Bob was questioned and told to give up the name of the person who called the station to confess and when Bob refused he was arrested himself on suspicion of being the murderer. He was kept in an isolated cell and denied visits and them would be charged with the following ""conspiracy to commit murder, obstructing the course of justice through violating confidentiality in criminal investigations, harboring a criminal, and failing to uphold “public solidarity.” The conspiracy charge was justified by the police by explaining that Bob would've met the man who claimed to the murderer and refused to inform the authorities.

Due to Bob's popularity in Burundi and with several international organizations vouching for him he was released on a $9,500 bail on February 18, 2015. Although the charges were not dropped crowds cheered and celebrated when Bob was released dancing and singing in the streets with protest in support of Bob going on for days at a time. Later that year in May Bob would flee the country and now lives abroad in exile. Not long after on February 24, 2015 Christian would finally have a mental evaluation performed on him and although I can find any results he was moved from a prison into an asylum instead.

In Early April another man called into RPA claiming to be a hired killer and that Xaverian Father Claudio Marano attended meetings where the murder of the nuns were plotted. Father Claudio was interviewed by Italian newspaper il Fatto Quotidiano where he denied the allegations. It's worth noting that radio confessions are common in Burundi and that publicly confessing any sins or wrong doings can buy respect (at least according to one of my sources)

[Here is a video of Father Claudio's interview](https://youtu.be/-zx0YlaX9ys?t=17)

Afterwards pressure was put on The Burundian Authorities to conduct a more thorough investigation however political situation in Burundi would put a stop to any such investigation as President Pierre Nkurunziza would seek a third term in office which was unconstitutional and since Pierre was unpopular and considered oppressive the people rioted and Burundi would be plunged into a state of unrest lasting from April 26, 2015 - 2018 and in May a failed coup against Pierre would be launched. Once it was all over 1,700 Burundian's were left dead due to the unrest and another 390,000 fled the country.

On January 23, 2016 the convent was renamed to ""The Chapel of Peace and Mercy"" in honor of the nuns.

That is where the trail runs cold sadly. Christian as far as I can tell was never brought to trial and has either been silently released or remains in a mental asylum. General Adolphe Nshimirimana would be killed on August 2, 2015 when a rocket was fired at his car killing him instantly and injuring three others the motive was suspected to be in retaliation to the government cracking down on protest against President Pierre Nkurunziza. On December 13, 2016 one of the suspects in his killing escaped from prison after murdering a guard.

President Pierre Nkurunziza himself managed to get his third term despite all the unrest but he would die in office on June 8, 2020 of a heart attack.

No other suspects have ever come up in this case and it seems no further investigation was ever conducted.

In the small town of Chillicothe, Missouri with a population of 22,116 people in the year of 1990. Tragedy struck the town on November 13th around midnight in the home of Robertson family of 5. Someone had entered the home and immediately went into Lyndel (father) and Cathy’s (mother) bedroom, firing 6 shots. Two bullets stuck Cathy, one in the head and the other bullet in her stomach causing her to die. Lyndel had been shot four times, one of the bullets caused his teeth to shatter. The shooter managed to enter and escape the house and fire five bullets without the four other uninjured people in the house noticing. Scott, the son, woke up when he heard groaning noises coming from his parent’s bedroom. When he entered the room he saw his dad bloody and naked struggling to find the strength to stand. He attempted waking up his mom but was unable to. Rhonda (15), Renee (13) and Roxanne (8) enter the room and try to help their dad. Rhonda calls 911 &amp; her boyfriend Brian Alexander.  Brian calls the Woodworth family and tell’s them it is an emergency, as everyone in town was aware of how close these two families were. The Robertson’s and Woodworth’s ran a farming business together and they were neighbors. Claude Woodworth drove up his driveway to check on the Robertson’s around 12:30am and saw the abundance of lights and sirens.
Lyndel managed to survive. At the beginning, he was convinced that a sixteen year old guy named Brandon Hagen was the shooter. He is positive it was him. Lyndon &amp; Cathy’s daughter, Rochelle Robertson, was dating Brandon Hagen. Despite her mother’s strong urged for the relationship to end, she continued to see Hagen. Hagen had anger issues, he was suicidal when it came to her leaving him, and he was abusive to women. It didn’t take long for him to slap Rochelle. Police questioned Hagen on his whereabouts on the night of the murder, his mother and sister claimed to have seen him in bed at 11pm in Independence Missouri, making it impossible for him to have been the shooter. Although there was gun residue found on Brandon’s hands. And many people came forward to the police about seeing Brandon in town the night of the murder. 
Here is just one of the witness’ claim’s( atleast 3 witnesses)  copied and pasted from the link: (1990) June Cairns was used to her son Matt’s friends coming over to the house. Matt wasn’t particularly close with Brandon, whom he found cocky and a little too quick to pick fights over stupid things. One weekend in October 1990, Brandon stopped by the Cairns house to see Matt. He also wanted to use the family’s phone. Standing in the kitchen, he dialed the Robertsons’ number, and Cathy answered. Brandon asked to speak to Rochelle, who was home that day from St. Joseph, and Cathy said no. Brandon began yelling.
“You bitch!” June heard him say. “I’m going to slit your throat!”June saw Brandon again the morning of November 14. Sometime between 6 and 7 a.m., she was having coffee with her daughter and son-in-law when Brandon breezed into the house and went upstairs. Hours later, June heard about the murder of the shooting from the night before and Cathy Robertson’s death. She gave a formal statement to investigators, detailing what she’d heard Brandon say to Cathy on the phone and his arrival at her house the morning after the shooting. The investigators’ report, however, noted only that “Brandon started ‘bitching out’ Cathy Robertson and made threats toward her and Rochelle.” It didn’t include the time frame when June said Brandon had arrived at her home on November 14—which was around when Brandon had told police he’d left Independence.
Rochelle, who was living in St.Joe at the time of the shooting, claimed to have talked on the phone with him that night at 11pm but she changed her story when talking to the police and said she fell asleep while reading. She was also pregnant with Brandon’s child, but her family did not find out until after their mother’s death. They all despised of Brandon because of his cocky and violent behavior. They wanted him out of her life but she didn’t stop pursuing her love for him. It is discovered that many of the towns citizens came forward about seeing Brandon in town the evening of murder, making his alibi’s wrong. But the authorities have not done anything about this despite major red flags. Two people on separate occasions have come to police with statements about Brandon, claiming that Brandon had practically bragged about getting away with murder 
Witness one: (copied &amp; pasted from link)
“One night in 2008, Duncan had gone over to Brandon’s house. The men were drinking in the garage when Brandon started rifling through some boxes. There were wrestling trophies inside, but Brandon was more interested in newspaper clippings from a time when, he told Duncan, he’d been accused of murdering his girlfriend’s mom. The girlfriend’s parents “had wanted her to stop seeing him,” Duncan recalled. “Brandon said they’d fought all the time, this and that, him and the parents. And they thought he was too aggressive for her.” Brandon also talked about “someone named Mark,” Duncan said. “He was really talking down about this Mark guy, like how stupid he was.”
Duncan said that Brandon had made self-incriminating disclosures in the past, about cooking meth in college, selling ecstasy pills, and beating someone in Chicago with a golf club. Talking about being a murder suspect was, however perversely, in character for the Brandon that Duncan knew. “I didn’t think twice about it,” Duncan said.
“I’ve killed before and got away with it,” Duncan recalled Brandon saying. “What makes you think I can’t do it again?’

Two weeks after the conversation in the garage, Brandon came to Duncan and asked for a $5,000 investment in an MMA venue he was hoping to open. Duncan had young kids at home, and money was tight, so he said he couldn’t help. “He flew off the handle,” Duncan said of Brandon. When Duncan told him to calm down, Brandon threatened to kill his friend’s family.

Witness Two: according to Caleb in a deposition, Brandon “got angry about something and said, ‘I don’t mind shooting somebody or doing what I have to do.’” Caleb said that Brandon then “went into detail about how he had shot a couple of people in Chillicothe because they didn’t want him to date their daughter,” who was pregnant at the time. Caleb remembered Brandon’s saying that “he went to the house and went inside and shot the mom and dad and then he left. They were trying to take the baby away or make her not have a baby.”
Caleb pointed out that, back in 1998, it wasn’t as if someone at the condo could look up Brandon or the Chillicothe shooting on the internet as easily as they could in 2011. 
He has also been reported to authorities many times on accounts of being abusive to girlfriends and women in general. 
A resident of the town drove past the Robertson family’s home at 11:55 the night of the murder and saw what he believed was a Ford Bronco parked at the front of their house.
One of the witnesses who came forward said they had seen Brandon at a gas station with a Ford Bronco.
The craziest part is….. Lyndel Robertson let’s go of his theory of thinking Brandon is the culprit. Instead, he believes that his business partner and family friends, the Woodworth’s, had something to do with it. 
Lyndel hires a private investigator, and with the help of the Livingston County Sheriff’s Department, the Chillicothe police, and other municipal authorities (such as prosecutors) they frame Mark Woodworth (16 years old at the time.) 
Mark would end up serving time in prison for a crime he did not commit until he was 39 years old. (While Brandon Hagan bragged to others about murdering his girlfriends parents back in 1990.) Mark was originally serving 4 life sentences but the odd holes in the case caught the attention of Bob Ramsey, an attorney who fought for 13 years to free Mark. 

The murder of Cathy Robertson has not be solved. And despite the loads of evidence that prove Mark Woodworth is innocent, the Robertson’s still claim that Mark did it. 
I find this strange because the sisters in the Robertson family had reported that the Woodworth family was like a second family to them. So why do the Robertson’s believe that 16 year old family friend Mark Woodworth wanted to kill Cathy more than violent Brandon who has made death threats toward Cathy? Let’s not forget, gun residue was found on Brandon’s hands and he &amp; his family lied about his whereabouts on the night of the murder.
Why was Rochelle trying to protect Brandon? She lied to authorities on multiple occasions regarding her communications with Brandon.
Her mother established a restraining order for Rochelle against Brandon. The restraining order was sitting on the dining room table the night she was murdered.
She also did not tell anyone she was pregnant until after her mom died.

In her own interview with police, Rochelle said of her mother, “I loved her and everything, but it’s just that—it seemed like she didn’t like any of my boyfriends and I never did anything right.”
“I could never look her in the eye,” she said in the same interview, “because I always felt that she didn’t like me very much.”
According to her manager, Loronda Corbin, Rochelle said she “hated” her mother, “wished she was dead,” and “wished somebody would shoot her.” (Corbin was not called as a witness at either of Mark’s trials.)

908,typhoidsergei,[],1633426499,"15-year-old Cristian Sedeno was last seen at the Ala Moana Shopping Center in Honolulu, Hawaii on Saturday, October 13, 2003. Her mother was involved in an abusive relationship and had decided to leave her abuser and move with Cristian to the island of Maui (they resided on the island of Oahu at the time of Cristian's disappearance). They were preparing to move when Cristian disappeared. Due to various sightings (although it is unclear if any these have been confirmed), authorities believe she may be in Oahu or Las Vegas, Nevada. Cristian's case has been classified as that of a runaway. No further information is available at this time.

Cristian is of mixed Caucasian, Filipino, and Native Hawaiian descent. She was 5'1"" tall and weighed 160 pounds at the time she went missing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

Was the boyfriend ever investigated?

Was she abducted? She was last seen at Ala Moana, which is a major attraction for tourists and locals alike. Would it really be possible to pull off an abduction in such a popular location?

Did she truly run away? How would she be able to pull it off on a small island? If she and her mother were going to leave the abusive boyfriend, what would be the motive?

There is a beach nearby where she went missing. Did something happen there?

On, June 14, 1999, private security patrolling the abandoned El Rancho Hotel at 2755 Las Vegas Boulevard South discovered a body hanging from an outside wall.

The decedent was male, 6'1"", 194 pounds. The age estimate is ""18-65 years old"", which must be a generic or template answer -- the equivalent of a ""don't know"" -- because if you look at the postmortem image on NAMUS, the victim is clearly much older than 18 but much younger than 65.

He was wearing a black pants and belt, blue t-shirt, maroon undershirt, gray socks, and black shoes.

911,Arseofthepig,[],1633377497,"Hi folks!


I have been working on a write up of the April Fabb case, but unfortunately I've been suffering with a sinus infection that decided to spread around my head (0/10, do not recommend), so with that in mind, I wanted to end my long writing break with a ""simpler"" case.

So today we will be starting our story, just outside the arse of the pig in the county of Essex. As mentioned in previous posts, Essex is Suffolk's next door neighbour. Whilst much of Essex is still rural, it's positively cosmopolitan compared to its rural neighbour. Within Essex is the town of Coggeshall, a small town around 20 miles from the border of Suffolk. 

On 23 July 1983, Diane Jones and her husband were drinking at the Woolpack pub in Coggeshall, roughly a mile from their home at the time. Diane had apparently asked to be taken out at 10:20pm that night and was reported by witnesses to be drunk. Shortly after being seated off the bar, she fell off the seat backwards and was helped back up. 

At closing time, Diane refused to leave, stating 'I'm not going home with you, you’ll beat me up' to her husband, Dr Jones. Upon hearing this, Dr Jones put his dog and Diane's handbag in his car and then returned to manhandle Diane out of the door as she was still refusing to leave. It is believed that once he got her out of the pub, he carried her to the car over his shoulder.

This was the last time anyone except her husband saw her alive. Her decomposing body was found at around 3.30pm on October 22, 1983, thirty miles away in Brightwell, Suffolk by a beater during a pheasant shoot. 

Due to decomposition, her body was identified through dental records two days after her initial discovery. She had been killed by blunt force trauma, potentially by a weapon similar to a slater’s hammer with a long spike on one side and a square hammer on the other. She had been hit with such force that her skull was fractured in four places. She was also found to be two months pregnant at the time of death.

Now let's rewind to that evening on the 23rd July and look at what her husband said had happened. 

Diane was Jones' third wife, they had been arguing frequently and were on the point of separating. After getting Diane into the car he drove the mile to their home where he dropped Diane off at the front gate because ""She always liked to do that because the gravel damages ladies’ heels"" and then parked the car. When he entered the house, Diane was gone. Jones insists he believed that his wife had just walked out on him. He didn't report Diane missing until August 1, 1983, 9 days later!

When the police were finally alerted, they immediately treated her disappearance as suspicious. Police from Suffolk and Essex launched a joint investigation, with incident rooms being set up in both Coggeshall and Suffolk. Police searched 70miles of roadside verges as well as searching the Jones' home.

Surprising to absolutely nobody, Jones was arrested on November 14, 1983 under suspicion of the murder of his wife. He was released two days later due to lack of evidence. He was arrested once more in 1990 after new evidence was found. Once again, the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence. Jones has always denied any responsibility for the murder of his wife.

It is easy to infer that Dr Jones was abusive, if Diane's accusations are true (and I tend to believe they are). Local newspapers also reported that Dr Jones had beaten a man who had supposedly been involved in a ""three-in-a-bed romp"" with Mrs Jones and another man. So it is possible that Dr Jones was a violent man. And let's be honest, in cases such as these, it is usually the spouse.


But innocent until proven guilty.

“I, Olga Hepnarova, victim of your bestiality, sentence you to death by running over, and declare that my life is worth of x of others. Acta non verba”. This is the last sentence from the letter she left before heading to her killing mission.

  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

Maybe some of you have already heard about Olga Hepnarova. On 10th of July 1973, she ran over 30 people on tram stop on Strossmayer Square in Prague, killing eight. I wanted to peek deeper into a soul of her personality and understand the motives via tracking important points of her life and last hours before the tragedy. It's debatable if society could have done something or some people are just pure evil. 

On Tuesday 10th of July 1973 is beautiful summer day in Prague. Young 22 year old woman is getting out of the [truck](https://imgur.com/a/nC1YnYf) Praga RN and wants to rent it. 
She completed a seven-kilometer test drive without any problems and proved that she is able to drive the car.
Karel V., who rent her a vehicle, was impressed by her ride. The man checks the condition of the vehicle one last time and then hands it over to the young woman. He also reminds her that the car is after the general and that the steering needs to be adapted accordingly. ""Speed up to sixty (km/h), no more"" he advises the girl. She pays some fee for practice ride and leaves. 

[Olga Hepnarová](https://imgur.com/a/WmXILmD) is leaving to take revenge on the world.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;


**Unhappy Childhood**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;


Olga Hepnarova was born to a family of Bank Clerc and a Dentist. She grew as any other child without any mental issues up until puberty. According later statements though her problems started during the childhood when her parents punished her very harshly. 

“All adults in our family treated me like they picked me somewhere, like I was a found child. My older sister had also negative attitude towards me, she was hostile. In that time something began what continued to the point that they crippled my soul” Hepnarova recalled her memories from childhood.

“I can’t deny that me and my daughter didn’t go along well.  I had reservations about her nature and behavior. All the contradictions were caused by her stubbornness” said her father Antonin.

However, it is difficult to say what was real and what young Olga interpreted in her own way. According to the writer Roman Cílek, the author of the books Olga Hepnarová and Noose for The Eight Dead, the teenage girl was very sensitive and perhaps even perceived stepping on her foot as a conspiracy. It was a vicious circle. With each injustice, she became more closed, and the more closed she was, the more cruel the injustice became.

The girl practically didn’t go to school, it was almost impossible for her to stand her classmates. 
In 1964, at the age of thirteen, she overdosed on pills, taking 10 tablets of Meprobamat - a powerful hypnotic. Her sister found her unconscious and with a bleeding mouth. Finally, she was placed in a psychiatric hospital in Opařany, South Bohemia.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

**Hate Turned Into Fire**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

Here Olga finished elementary school and studied for librarian. After that she went back to Prague living with her parents. 
However their relationship was still very problematic and constantly deteriorating. Hatred for parents and people in general escalated. She longed to do something: something that would give a different character to everyday domestic reproachful quarrels, writes Roman Cílek.
The young girl wanted revenge on her father in particular, so in August 1970 she tried to set a fire to her father's parents' house. At that time, her sister slept there with two old tenants, and they finally managed to put out the fire. In the end, the total damage was only 50 crowns, and Hepnarová, who 
escaped immediately after the door was lit, was not suspected by anyone.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;




**I, Olga Hepnarova**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

Young woman is sitting behind the wheel of parked truck Praga RN. She headed here from the place where she rented the vehicle for some rest and carefully planned the next steps. 
Her revenge must be as great as possible, she needs to kill as many people as possible. She reconsiders 3 places: Park or 2 busy avenues. She decides for Strossmayer Square – busy location close to Prague city center where a lot of people changing or waiting for their trams. 
""It occurred to me a little earlier that I could also choose Wenceslas Square (the busiest avenue in Prague and common hot spot for tourists either), but I rejected it because I would attract attention with a truck there even before I’d be able to do anything,"" Hepnarová said later. In the end, she decides for Strossmayer Square, steps on the gas and sets off.
 
 It’s around 1 o’clock in the afternoon. Along the way she throws 2 letters into mailbox. They are intended for daily journals Svobodne Slovo and Mlada Fronta. Both have the same wording. Olga Hepnarova is listing all the offences committed by society against her.
“I am a ruined person. Human destroyed by people. So I have a choice: kill myself or kill others. And I decide this: I will repay my HATERS. If I left as an unknown person who committed suicide, it would be too cheap for you.
I, Olga Hepnarova, victim of your bestiality, sentence you to death by running over, and declare that my life is worth of x of others. Acta non verba”.  Acta non verba means Action, no words.
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;



**The Last Straw**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

Emotionally, Olga Hepnarová suffered. She was attracted to both men and women. She had intimate contact with both sexes but she could not maintain a relationship in any way. She later describes herself as asexual. Her important turning points in her life in 1972 &amp; 1973 she spent with boyfriend Miroslav.

However, even he could not discourage her from going to the abyss, and thus witnessed her mental fall to the bottom. When she buys her first car it fills her with joy but it cannot cover up her mental problems. 
Olga becomes more and more closed and her hatred towards the world escalates. Boyfriend advices her to seek professional help. 
Hepnarova will visit a doctor in a psychiatric hospital in Bohnice. The girl cannot communicate properly, she only tells the psychiatrist that she is tired and needs some rest.
""Take a vacation,"" the doctor tells her, noting anything abnormal about her. If you have other problems, contact your GP. That was probably the last straw for Hepnarova.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

**Fatal Decision**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;


The truck drives down to Strossmayer Squire. 
The young girl is determined to kill. But she still has to wait a while. ""The situation at the chosen place was not suitable for me, there was a tram in the stop, people were already scattered and I was not guaranteed success,"" Hepnarova later said. The car just goes through a crossroads. She makes few circles and heading down towards Strossmayer Square again. 

She is ready and expects to be caught. She packed her clothes and cigarettes. There are enough people on tram stop, about thirty. Now here comes her moment. Olga Hepnarova steps on the gas and drives directly into the people on the stop. Three (one man and two woman) die on the spot, another three on the same day in hospital and another two as result of injures later in hospital. Another six people are seriously injured and six people slightly injured.

The taxi driver behind her stops immediately, he calls ambulance and runs to nearby police station. But shocked police officers are already running out of it.
Two of them get to the truck, in which Hepnarová is sitting motionless.
Along the way, they must disperse an enraged crowd, which gathered around the truck.

“For God's sake, woman - did you fall asleep behind the wheel?"" One of the members asks her. ""No, I didn't fall asleep and the brakes are fine. I drove to the sidewalk on purpose and it is my revenge towards society for the way it has treated me all my life, ""the young girl replies.
It takes a while for the shocked police to recover from what Hepnarova said. ""Take her inside or people will lynch her here,"" the older of the officers ordered. Hepnarová soon finds herself in a cell. She changes several of them, but she never in her life leaves the walls of the prison anymore.
Several rounds of interrogations follow. Important questions like why she did that, is it politically motivated, is she part of any suspicious group etc. But she told her entire tragic story to investigators. 
Her lawyer is convinced that Hepnarova suffers from schizophrenia. But he is the only one during the trial. The public, the prosecutor and even Hepnarova herself demand an exemplary maximum sentence. She was finally sentenced to death on April 6, 1974.

Her mother, whom Olga hated so much from the bottom of her heart, appeals, but in vain. In the end, the case is also being considered by the Supreme Court. Although they reclassified the crime from murder to a public endangerment, they confirm the verdict.


On the day of the execution, she fiercely defended herself against the guards and they had to force her into the execution chamber. Perhaps because it was only then that she realized that in Czechoslovakia they were hanging on a so-called short rope where the executed person died long torturous minutes. Perhaps because only then did she realize that the end was near.

A young woman, who ruined eight human lives and her own, was hanged on March 12, 1975 in the Pankrac prison.

By a strange coincidence, the street on which she committed the murder of innocent people, is named today after Milada Horakova, the women, which was also hung in Pankrac, but 25 years before Olga. Unlike Hepnarova though, Milada Horakova was a public figure and she was executed based on fabricared charges in fabricated process for ""subversive conspiracy."" I live just few minutes walking from the place.

*\[transcript\]*

On February 26th, a week after officials began searching for the lost hikers, they discovered their campsite. Tents shredded, half covered with snow. Only soft footprints leading from the campsite to downhill disturbed the otherwise pristine snow surface. A few hundred meters from the campsite, they found the remains of the campers, frozen in time. Some naked, others wearing haphazardly chosen clothing, and some having become feeding grounds for scavengers. The difficult to traverse passage became known as the Dyatlov Pass, after the group’s leader, Igor Alekseyevich Dyatlov.

Sixty years have since passed.

And in that period, people have developed and spread theories ranging from the mundane such as hypothermic psychosis to those that may be described as… a little bit more out-of-the-box such as experimental soviet radiation weapons and the often spoken in whispers, Snow Yetis.

Soon after the bodies were discovered, the Soviet government began an inquest into the deaths of the hikers. As you may expect, their investigation was hampered by bureaucratic red-tape, the overt secrecy which had embedded itself into any activity conducted by government officials, and a lack of communication between investigation members.

The mystery and bizarre details of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, as well as the secrecy of the Soviet government inquest, has led to recurring conversations and debate surrounding the Truth of the Dyatlov Pass Incident. 

I believe that it is likely not as exciting as you or I may like. I’ll admit, I was partial to the secret soviet nuclear weapons test theory when I had first heard of the events that occurred on Kholat Syakhl - but recent research supports a more mundane explanation for the series of events which occured to our travelers. 

According to research published in Communications Earth &amp; Environment which worked from a prior publication by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, the data indicates that Dyatlov and his companions fell victim not to the supernatural, nor to any sort of man-made effort, but instead to the consequences of their own actions on the natural environment they traversed.

Written by Johan Gaume &amp; Alexander Puzrin, and peer-reviewed earlier this year, the researchers contended that the theory that was previously advanced by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation was correct; that the deaths of the Dyatlov hiking group was indirectly caused by an avalanche. Through their geomechanical knowledge of snow physics, Gaume and Puzrin strengthen this theory, definitively in my opinion. 

While the Russian Federation’s report published contended that the Dyatlov hikers fell victim to the natural event of an avalanche, there were shortcomings in the report in that they failed to address certain criticisms directed towards this theory, which encouraged those interested in the Dyatlov Mystery to dismiss it for perhaps more memorable or exciting hypotheses. The counterarguments most commonly used to critique the ""avalanche theory"" are the following:

1. The skulls and rib cages of some of the hikers were crushed - reminiscent of damaged sustain from blunt force trauma - whereas traditional victims of these natural disasters die from asphyxiation. Hundreds of pounds of snow keeping mountaineers immobilized as they gasp for any amount of oxygen, without success.
2. The avalanche occurred  hours after they pitched their tent, carved into the slope. For context, when mountaineering, some travelers choose to place their tent within low angled slopes by cutting downwards - allowing for protection from harsh winds, which is just as deadly, if not more, than the cold to those who risk their lives inching their way up the sides of beastly mountains. Why did the snow break so late into the night and not when the initial cut was made?
3. As mentioned, the slope was not theoretically steep enough to allow for the conditions that would contribute to an avalanche. At lower than 30°, it shouldn’t have been physically possible for an avalanche to be triggered. So how could it?
4. When the search and rescue team arrived at the campsite, the earth was near pristine. There was no evidence of an avalanche having recently occurred. Only the lopsided tent, its mangled wing flapping against thunderous gusts, disturbed the powdered surface of the abandoned site. If there had been an avalanche large enough to cause the deaths of a near dozen in the area, why was there no physical evidence of its presence?

Gaume and Puzrin broke down these criticisms in their paper through their knowledge of physics.

They tackle arguments surrounding the too-shallow slope by analysing topographic information on the area where the avalanche is theorized to occur. According to the data, the ground on which the slope rested was deeper and steeper than it appeared. Moreover, statistical analysis of accidentally triggered avalanches in years prior demonstrates that avalanches are not completely unheard of at lower angles. 15% of accidental avalanches occurred at angles between 20° and 30°. With the slope secretly steeper than expected and the rare, but not impossible occurrence of avalanches below those levels, the degree of the slope did not weaken the avalanche theory as much as some would have you believe.

They continue on to discuss its delayed fall. If the load bearance allowed for sudden mass drop in snow sheets, why did it not fall immediately, instead of nine hours later? Gaume and Puzin concluded that katabatic winds, those which are high density - causing downward directed windfall - blew fresh snow onto the slope into which they had cut to place their tent. More more more, the snow accumulated. Angled. Until the sheet could hold no more. And then it collapsed - crushing the unfortunate nine.

Additionally, the fragile snow sheet laid on top of a stronger layer, leading to only the top section freeing itself, causing heavy snowfall onto the tent in which the hikers resided, while minimizing its impacts on the area - it guaranteed that there would be none of the usual signs of an avalanche.

Finally, their injuries. The damage they sustained. How could the disfigurement and the spider web of fractures which lined their upper skeletal structure be explained by an avalanche, when near none of known victims of avalanches suffered from similar injuries? Simply because they weren’t simple avalanche victims. The researchers explained the damaged sustained by comparing it to existing trauma data, citing knowledge generated through vehicle crash testing.

When people fall victim to avalanches, they’re most likely to be standing when the impact overwhelms their physical bodies. Or, for those finding themselves prone as darkness befalls them, their bodies are pushed into an equally pliable surface - minimizing internal damage whilst sealing the fate of those resting under the snow sheet. For our nine lost souls, they rested horizontally on a firm and dense surface into which they had carved the tent. The impact of the avalanche as it made contact with their bodies was no different than a severe and high amount of pressure against a person whose back rested against a wall. High velocity. Impact. Internal damage. Our hikers were able to escape, but not without natural events condemning them to their inevitable ends.

\-------------------------

One issue that isn't addressed by Gaume and Puzrin is the presence of radioactive isotopes on some of the bodies. There are a few theories floating around that can be used to justify its presence. Two that make the most sense to me are the following. 

The USSR conducted a number of secretive nuclear weapons tests in and around the Ural Mountains following the Second World War. It's possible that they tracked some through their hike in some areas that where exposed to radioactive materials.

Another possibility, is that the isotopes were transferred onto the bodies by one of the government officials who examined the scene - perhaps they had been previously in an area with a higher-than-normal amount of radiation.

In a couple years, we might get lucky enough to have a study published by a nuclear physicists giving their ""take"" on the Dyatlov Pass Incident. ;)","Nine Soviet hikers vanished as they made their trek through Kholat Syakhl -- Death Mountain -- their bodies were discovered months later. For decades, the mystery of their disappearance and subsequent death has caused a frenzy amongst True Crime and Conspiracy theorist. I believe it's been solved."

This is a case that has mostly been forgotten, but it's always kind of stuck with me. I didn't really know the Gaffields, but I lived in the same apartment complex at the same time that they were there. I was about the same age as her younger sister (about 6) and I recall being with her sister, my sister and another friend at their apartment about the day she went missing, because my sister was there trying to console her sister. I wasn't her sister's friend per se, but my sister was.

Anyway, this is the town of Webster, New York's only cold case and I was opening up this thread as another avenue for people to share what they might or might not know about it, or if they have any leads, or if they have any other theories.

She disappeared on August 8, 1995 and her remains were found less than a mile away in some woods by a hunter about two months later. One article says hers was considered an ""unattended death,"" meaning no one was actually there when she died. I do vaguely recall people suspected there was foul play involved; rape perhaps, but I can only conjecture. EDIT: Actually, [here's a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WithoutATrace/comments/ieo6zt/comment/g2ks3n7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I found that her cousin made saying she was raped.

Another edit ... [a bit more detail:](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/ny-kelley-gaffield-16-webster-8-august-1995.287395/) "" *Decomposition was too advanced to determine how she died, but broken ribs and the bodys position led medical examiners to believe her death was a homicide, according to contemporaneous news reports. She was found nude, with her clothing in a nearby pile.""*

Webster is right next to Rochester, a decent-sized city that is very, very hood in some parts. If the perpetrator was someone from the city, then I can almost see why it would be hard to track the him down. Do the deed and get back into the metropolis where you'll just blend in. No one snitches.

“Wow, so they didn’t even express they feel sorry for the victim? They’re cruel and heartless.”

919,Mycelium83,[],1633251362,"Saturday night, 1998 in Perth, Western Australia a lone man was was walking along the Armadale train line close to the Burswood Casino. At around 11:20pm he would be fatally struck by a passenger train travelling along the line. Unfortunately this isn't uncommon. Suicide by train happens fairly regularly all over the world. Local newspapers here won't even print stories about it. Any train based suicides are always referred to as an incident on the tracks. This is done so other people aren't encouraged to consider it. 

This wouldn't really be a mystery most of the time. Except this man was never identified. A young constable by the name of Jen Robinson attended the incident that night and she has spent over twenty years trying to solve his identity in the hopes of finding his family. 

His death and being unable to locate his family moved her so much she petitioned the coroner to have his body released and organised his funeral. 

I came across this in a book of Australian unsolved mysteries and thought it was interesting because I'd never heard of it and because so much work had been done to investigate it just seems weird it was never solved. 

The man's fingerprints were sent to multiple agencies including Interpol. Same with his DNA. His story was featured on Australia's Most Wanted an old true crime TV show that was on national television. 

From her investigations the constable had theorised that the man may have been gambling in at the casino near by. Maybe losing all his money and becoming depressed. She also theorised the man was a traveller possibly from New Zealand due to the labels on his clothes. That's about as much as she could find out. She was still investigating as of 2018 and hoped to solve it before she retired.  

I think its sad that no one has come forward. I also think he was from outside Australia or interstate as Perth is a very small city and its unlikely he wouldn't have been recognised. 

He was only young. Twenties or thirties at most looking at his identikit photo so someone somewhere must be missing him and wondering what happened to him. 

I'm not sure if his DNA has been compare to any geanology databases but I'm not sure that's something police would use in Australia as it may be a breach of privacy. 

I hope the constable does solve the case and his family learn what happened to him.

The witnesses described him as looking 'Latin', which possibly meant Italian but probably not Latino.

Found out about this case because someone on this sub had listed missing girl from Hawaii. Intrigued, I began looking a various different cases in the Aloha State. One thing lead to another and this mystery did not seem so mysterious...   If I am right, how on earth did it go on for so long unresolved?  

Deesha Maunakea is reported missing last seen at her house in Waimanalo in Hawaii on September 15 2020.   She is a 39 year old Hawaiian woman, 5'7 and 300 pounds. Deesha needs daily meds.  A missing persons report is filed. 

So, What happened? In the missing persons report it is stated that she likes to hang out at Ala Moana, a shopping mall across from Magic island.  On September, 19th Namus.gov reports a Hawaiian woman is found by bystanders floating face down in the water off Magic Island and pronounced dead when they get her to shore.  My guess is she went to the beach and perhaps go caught by a unexpected wave.  Perhaps got caught in the riptide that is reported to be strong there, but the she was wearing pants, so I don't know if that is what she wore into the ocean for a swim. Was she walking on the docks near by and fell in?  The temperature is in the 80s in September.  Did she get hot? Decide to cool off? 

 But, where was she the 4 days from the last time she was seen?  Did she often leave for a few days at a time?  Still, many unanswered questions. Like, why is there a 750 word minimum for submissions?


  It has to be the same person, same height, same weight, I think.   BUT the date she was reported found is 2019, a full year before Deesh is reported missing! Impossible!   Further reading of the report it says they estimate the year of death to be 2020. So if do run computer searches, the date is off, so perhaps the ability to run a computer search is disabled by a typo. Still, it seems bizarre that no one saw her picture in the paper, and knew about the body being found in the water.

 
Hard to believe that it wasn't put together before, if I am right, and crazy coincidence if I am wrong. Like, I wouldn't leave the house if I fit the description Sept 2022! What are the odds?

 I called the number on the crimestoppers so it possible this has finally been resolved.  To think the family has suffered over a year from a typo is heartbreaking.  Would this been solved faster if she was not a native woman and maybe a tourist from California? (Assuming its been solved)  

Does anyone know if there are similar oversites by the data entry that has caused delays in resolving cases?  

Thank you guys for teaching me so much on this site!  Maybe a case of beginers luck, but I would not have known about Namus, or Charley Project if it wasn't for you all.

Three men charged in the grisly 2011 slaying of a Brooklyn cafe owner during a botched mugging have all pleaded guilty, authorities said.
Kevin Taylor, 28, and Gary Robles, 38, copped to one count each of conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery Thursday in Manhattan federal court for fatally shooting, then torching the body of 30-year-old Joshua Rubin Oct. 31. Taylor also pleaded to one count of witness tampering. Michael Mazur, 27, copped to one count of robbery in July

“Not only did the defendants kill Rubin, they then drove his body to rural Pennsylvania where they set it on fire in an attempt to conceal the murder,” said Manhattan US Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement.

Prosecutors said the trio could have saved Rubin’s life if they had sought medical help — instead of trying to cover up the crime

Shortly before the shooting, the trio hatched a plan to rob Rubin, according to court papers. Taylor called the cafe owner and arranged to buy one pound of marijuana from him, Robles brought the gun and Mazur served as a lookout.
But when Rubin walked into the meeting spot, a McDonald Avenue apartment in Brooklyn, Taylor and Robles demanded that the cafe owner hand over the drugs. When Rubin refused, Robles shot him, court papers charge.
The trio bought supplies at Home Depot, then wrapped Rubin’s body in plastic bags, tossed it in the trunk and drove two hours to rural Pennsylvania.

They stuffed his body in a garbage can, doused it with accelerant and set him on fire, according to prosecutors.
Rubin’s charred corpse was discovered in a wooded area near Allentown on Nov. 1, 2011, but the case went cold for years.
The men were busted in 2020 after Taylor paid cash bribes to a potential witness in an attempt to keep the witness from snitching on him, officials said.
Investigators recovered cellphone data that placed all three men at the murder scene and at the location where Rubin’s body was found. At the time of their arrest, the feds seized $200,000 in cash and 213 pounds of marijuana from the Kensington home Taylor and Mazur shared.

Rubin was 30 years old at the time of his death.
Rubin owned Whisk Bakery Cafe in Ditmas Park and owed at least $14,000 to creditors before the Halloween slaying.

Mazur is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 6. Taylor and Robles are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 3, 2022. They each face up to 20 years behind bars on the top count.",Three plead guilty to grisly 2011 cold-case murder of Brooklyn cafe owner
926,BroiledBoatmanship,[],1633137168,"A bit of a preface: This isn’t your typical r/UnresolvedMysteries case, but it still baffles me. The way the shooter prepared and carried out his plan is fascinating in a terrifying way. 

A judge approved an $800 million settlement on Wednesday September 30, 2020 for victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting, which is considered the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Sixty people were killed and over 700 were injured. Up until two days before the settlement, 58 people were counted in the death count, but two individuals recently died from health complications related to their shooting injuries. 

After months of negotiations, all sides in a class action lawsuit against the owner of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas agreed to the settlement, plaintiffs' attorney Robert Eglet told CNN by phone.

The settlement was divided among more than 4,000 claimants in the class action suit. The exact amounts going to each victim was determined independently by a pair of retired judges agreed to by both sides.

To this day there is still no motive found regarding the shooting. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said in an interview that the FBI, LVMPD, and CCSO were unable to “answer definitively on why Stephen Paddock committed this act”. The shooter, or domestic terrorist as he should be called, was a 64 year old avid gambler, named Steven Paddock. He spent a whole week preparing an arsenal of semi automatic weapons in his hotel room. He used a bump stock when he opened fire, which allows a semi automatic weapon to fire at a higher rate. This is shooting alone actually caused President Trump to completely ban bump stocks in the US. 

Stephen Paddock actually had visited multiple other hotels near music festivals. This terrifyingly supports the fact that he had been planning this for at least a year, and was wanting to make sure he could kill the most amount of people before he was found by law enforcement. It was found that he had shot at jet fuel tanks across Las Vegas Blvd, under the assumption that it would distract people on the ground from the shooting if the tanks were to explode. The amount of premeditation is what terrifies me the most. 

The Mandalay Bay is owned by MGM Resorts International. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, MGM indicated that only $49 million of the settlement would come from the company's funds, with the remaining $751 million being covered by liability insurance.

927,BurtGummer1911,[],1633136177,"During the 80s and the 90s, a number of killers and rapists were stalking Paris. One remained unidentified - until this week.


The man, implicated in four homicides and six rapes, and suspected of over ten murders in total, was given the sobriquet ""le Grêlé"", due to the crater-like pox or acute acne scars that marked his face. The most notorious attack attributed to him was the 1986 rape and murder of 11-year-old Cécile Bloch, a crime which remained one of France's most notorious cold cases for decades.


This year, Parisian magistrate Nathalie Turquey worked with the Paris DRPJ to instigate the efforts to conduct a mass DNA test of gendarmes who were in active service at the time of le Grêlé's attacks. The possibility that the killer may have been a gendarme was first considered in 1987, when a surviving victim testified that the attacked had presented her with a warrant card. Suspicions that the killer may have been familiar with police techniques, and had used that to his advantage, strengthened the hypothesis. The recent investigation renewed the approach, now invigorated by the possibility of using DNA analysis.


Eventually, the test, which would encompass over 700 retired officers, was approved. The men were informed by post of the tests, and of the days on which they would be taking them.


One of the retirees who had been scheduled to take the test on September 24 did not take it. Instead, he used the AirBnb portal to rent an apartment in Grau-du-Roi. Inside, he left a letter of confession, and then poisoned himself. A post-mortem DNA test confirmed his identity, in more ways than one: the man, 59-year-old François Vérove, married father of two, was the elusive ""le Grêlé"".


As a retiree, Vérove appears to have been involved in local activism and politics in Prades-le-Lez, which he would occasionally mention on Twitter and Facebook. His suicide note contained an admission of his guilt in crimes attributed to le Grêlé. Vérove also claimed that he was able to interrupt the killing cycle after entering into the relationship with the woman who would become his wife, and establishing a family - somewhat similar to the likes of de Angelo and Rader (and one wonders if after he had begun his dormant period, he, too, lapsed at any point and committed any other crimes - though not necessarily rapes or murders).


(Incidentally, that is what I personally suspect of the Zodiac: a sudden break in the murders, caused by the fear of his encounter with Fouke and Zelms - and then permanent dormancy, kept stable due to a new, lengthy relationship with a woman, possibly a divorcée with a child).

In the 1930s Brighton was the most resplendent of seaside resort towns in the UK. It also enjoyed a reputation as a place where sexual illicitness was allowed, expected and even invited. ‘A dirty weekend in Brighton’ was a popular catch phrase. But among the many nicknames, ‘Torso city’ seemed the most deserving from a weird coincidence for the town being the scene for three out of five popular trunk crimes in Great Britain. 

We will explore three trunk crimes in Part 1 and the remaining two in Part 2


## 1. Celia Holloway

Late 1820s John Holloway, a petty criminal and laborer on the Brighton Chain Pier started dating Celia. She became pregnant, he refused to marry her and with the help of her church, she got him jailed until he agreed. He relented after 5 weeks and married her. Alas, that baby and the next died very quickly. 

&amp;nbsp;


John started seeing another woman, Ann Kennett and both women were pregnant in 1831 when he killed his wife Celia with the help of his girlfriend, and dismembered her. Body parts were hidden in a trunk and buried in a shallow grave near Lover’s Walk. A local fisherman noticed that some earth had been recently disturbed, and thus he was caught.

&amp;nbsp;


Long-story-short, he was tried, hanged but Ann got away with a non-guilty. The next day, his body was brought back to Brighton and displayed at the Town Hall, where it drew a crowd of over 23,000 people. This was very high profile and sensational at the time. Celia Holloway is commemorated by a plaque at St Peter’s Church.

## 2. Beatrice Ellen Maud and sons

1905, Arthur Devereux poisoned his wife and their twin disabled two-year-old sons with morphine salts. He a was a dentist and a chemist’s assistant. Stuffed their dismembered bodies in a tin trunk, fitted with a custom air-tight cover. The trunk was hidden in a warehouse in Kensal Rise until his mother-in-law found it a few months later. 

&amp;nbsp;

A local police sergeant pried open the trunk at the request of Mrs Ellen Gregory, who had heard nothing from her 30-year-old daughter Beatrice Ellen Maud and two grandsons Evelyn and Laurence. The trunk containing the bodies of his wife and twin sons had been very professionally strapped, padlocked, screwed-down and hermetically sealed with fungi-depressing boric acid glue to prevent give-away decomposition. The police surgeon said it could have existed for years without revealing  any sign of its grisly contents

&amp;nbsp;


Deveraux claimed his wife had been morbidly depressed and had murdered the boys using poisons from his chemical stock, before killing herself. He hid them because he would be blamed for their deaths. He also tried a plea of insanity. 

&amp;nbsp;


The jury took just ten minutes to disagree. He was tried at Old Baily and hanged three weeks later on August 15, 1905.  This was also a major sensation and there are a lot of details for those interested, although it’s a solved case.

## 3. Unsolved, unrecognized, mystery

There was a lull of nigh on seven years before Brighton became the setting of another trunk crime.


Wednesday 6th June 1934 was [Derby Day] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO-Q51JsgFI). A world famous horse race held at Epsom Derby, UK attended by kings and queens. The winner was [Windsor Lad] (https://imgur.com/XKCi0Ak) owned by HH Maharaja of Rajpipla

That day was also one of the busiest days in public transport and a plywood trunk was left at the Brighton station unnoticed. It was stuffy in the left-luggage room. Occasionally a bus, cab or car in the forecourt of the station would send a breeze scuttling across the linoleum-surfaced counter, but this merely rearranged the stale air. 

&amp;nbsp;


Ten days later, the contents were examined at the left-luggage by William Joseph Vinnicombe and James Lelliot due to a peculiar smell. The trunk looked brand new with a light brown canvas cover, unscratched and marred only by the counterfoil of the threepenny ticket number G.1945 dabbed on the lid. It stood solitary on the stone floor where Harry Rout, the attendant who accepted it remembered how heavy it was.

The smell was just noxious and unbearable, but none could guess or were prepared for what’s to come. William Vinnicombe prevaricated, “It’s definitely not lilies of the valley”. They finally got a hold of a policeman and a detective, Edward Taylor who borrowed a truncheon to pry it open. A human trunk was found inside. No head, no arms, no legs. The clerks could remember nothing about the man who had left the trunk there on Derby Day. 

&amp;nbsp;


Senior detectives, the police surgeon, an undertakers shell and canvas screens and a posse of uniformed constables stormed the place. A scribbled note was posted apologizing for the inconvenience of closing the area. The offensive trunk, contents and all, had been removed to the mortuary. The floor space had been scrubbed with boiling water and Lysol, while the half dozen constables looked through the remaining luggage for the remaining body parts. 

&amp;nbsp;


The renowned pathologist and forensic expert Sir Bernard Spilsbury looked at the human remains, which were incomplete. She had been a young woman, probably in her early twenties. Her general physical condition suggested that she belonged to the middle or upper classes. She was well nourished, with a good figure, no slack flesh, and well-toned muscles that implied plenty of exercise. The golden brown of the skin also suggested that she could afford to spend a good deal of time in lower latitudes, that suggested wealth. Between 21 – 28 years old, 5 foot 2, roughly 8.5 stone. At the time of her death she had been pregnant.


&amp;nbsp;


Inspector Pelling enlisted the help of the press to appeal to the public. He requested any leads and to report any missing female relatives/friends etc. The response was over gratifying -12,000 letters, cards and telegrams were received, not counting the many telephone calls.

&amp;nbsp;


The Brighton police sent out an alert to all other left-luggage offices in England to search for mysterious abandoned packages. At King’s Cross station in London, the young woman’s legs were found in a [cheap brown suitcase]( https://imgur.com/a/oyMwQ8Y). The suitcase was deposited a day after Brighton. There were four objects wrapped in brown paper and copies of national newspapers. Each leg had been severed at the thigh and the knee. Two contained a human leg apiece and the other two, a foot each. They were the legs of a well-proportioned and athletic young woman. The press named the victim 'The Girl with the Pretty Feet' or simply 'Pretty Feet' because the corpse had 'Dancer's Feet', thought to be beautiful. 

&amp;nbsp;


Scotland Yard detective Robert Donaldson was assigned the case who came to Brighton with a team of detectives and officers. They set up shop by taking over three apartments adjoining the music salon in the Royal Pavilion. Amidst the chinoiserie bequeathed by George IV, and sometimes to the muffled accompaniment of string quartets, the task of trying to identify the Girl with the pretty feet was afoot. They were trying to establish who would go to such lengths to make the task so difficult

&amp;nbsp;


The investigation was unique and comprehensive. As a result, 732 missing women were traced. A questionnaire was sent to every hospital and nursing home in the country. At Queen Charlotte’s hospital in London, 5000 women received pre-natal advice or treatment between Feb and May. All but 15 were accounted for. 

&amp;nbsp;


They looked through register offices to see if any couples have given notice for marriage but failed to appear as there were scams going on.  

&amp;nbsp;


The body had been wrapped in disappointingly unpeculiar brown paper and 19 feet of venetian-blind cord. These could be purchased for a halfpenny a yard at a thousand hardware stores. Some banks of cotton wool soaked in blood cushioned the torso. 

&amp;nbsp;


On one sheet was the suffix ‘-ford’ written with a blue pencil. It looked as if it was the second half of a place-name, perhaps Guildford. In the trunk, there were two newspapers, copies of the Daily Mail for 31 May and 2 June. They were of an edition only circulated within fifty miles of London. All of these were went to the labs, but none of the new-fangled tests, using chemicals and ultra-violet rays helped. 

&amp;nbsp;


Then a porter remembered helping a man to carry the trunk on Derby Day. The man had travelled from Dartford to Brighton. Dartford was a place name ending in ‘ford’ and it was a place where the London edition of the Daily Mail might be bought. It began to look as though the murderer was a Dartford man. It also began to look as though the case was about to be solved. A girl who had sat in the same train compartment as the man from Dartford was able to give a general description of him. Five cheap day returns had been bought that day, and the ones that could be traced were eliminated by the police. The makers of the trunk and the suitcase were traced, but they were unable to connect the items with particular purchasers. Suddenly the trail had gone stone cold. 

&amp;nbsp;


The pathologist also said the young woman had died on about 30 May, a week before the trunk was left at Brighton station. The man who killed her must have had plenty of spare time, and presumably a home where he could safely conceal a body for a whole week without detection; this would have to be a man with a large property or a single man who had (and expected) no visitors. The fact that a whole week went by before the body was dumped suggested the murder was not premeditated. The disposal of the body had not been planned, and it had taken several days for the murderer to work out how to do it.

&amp;nbsp;


There was a lead that one or both arms were burned at Sussex Downs where war casualties were cremated, but couldn’t be verified. Another lead, a couple reported finding a young woman’s head in a rock pool while walking near Black Rock, east Brighton around the time the trunk was discovered. Apparently they thought it was a result of a known suicide and didn’t report it. The cops scoured the area and found nothing. The marine authorities concluded it would have been taken into the sea, if it were there at all.

&amp;nbsp;


Chief Inspector Donaldson suspected a local abortionist named Edward Massiah. He was a multi-racial man in his fifties from Trinidad with a collection of medical degrees. He was a shady character but had ties with the elites. Officers were drafted to covertly watch him. Eventually he was confronted and promptly referred to his lawyer who asked the cops to back off. Massiah later moved to London where a woman died while he was performing an illegal abortion, yet he evaded prosecution and continued working till he retired.

&amp;nbsp;


Spilsbury, always on the lookout for evidence of illegal abortions, described no evidence of interference with the pregnancy, and noted that the dismemberment showed no particular anatomical skill. 

## Sir Bernard Spilsbury

[Bernard Spilsbury] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Spilsbury) was a celebrity pathologist who conducted thousands of autopsies and at one point was considered infallible. He was knighted in 1923 and was swinging juries by just appearing in trials.

However, in later years his ego, work-style and personal life led to a severe decline in his work. This tragically ending with a suicide.

The Railway Murders by Jonathan Goodman (book)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_trunk_murders","Brighton, the Torso City and other trunk crimes in Great Britain Part 1"
929,BurtGummer1911,[],1633135920,"During the 80s and the 90s, a number of killers and rapists were stalking Paris. One remained unidentified - until this week.


The man, implicated in four homicides and six rapes, and suspected of over ten murders in total, was given the sobriquet ""le Grêlé"", due to the crater-like pox or acute acne scars that marked his face. The most notorious attack attributed to him was the 1986 rape and murder of 11-year-old Cécile Bloch, a crime which remained one of France's most notorious cold cases for decades.


This year, Parisian magistrate Nathalie Turquey worked with the Paris DRPJ to instigate the efforts to conduct a mass DNA test of gendarmes who were in active service at the time of le Grêlé's attacks. The possibility that the killer may have been a gendarme was first considered in 1987, when a surviving victim testified that the attacked had presented her with a warrant card. Suspicions that the killer may have been familiar with police techniques, and had used that to his advantage, strengthened the hypothesis. The recent investigation renewed the approach, now invigorated by the possibility of using DNA analysis.


Eventually, the test, which would encompass over 700 retired officers, was approved. The men were informed by post of the tests, and of the days on which they would be taking them.


One of the retirees who had been scheduled to take the test on September 24 did not take it. Instead, he used the AirBnb portal to rent an apartment in Grau-du-Roi. Inside, he left a letter of confession, and then poisoned himself. A post-mortem DNA test confirmed his identity, in more ways than one: the man, 59-year-old François Vérove, married father of two, was the elusive ""le Grêlé"".


As a retiree, Vérove appears to have been involved in local activism and politics in Prades-le-Lez, which he would occasionally mention on Twitter and Facebook. His suicide note contained an admission of his guilt in crimes attributed to le Grêlé. Vérove also claimed that he was able to interrupt the killing cycle after entering into the relationship with the woman who would become his wife, and establishing a family - somewhat similar to the likes of de Angelo and Rader (and one wonders if after he had begun his dormant period, he, too, lapsed at any point and committed any other crimes - though not necessarily rapes or murders).


(Incidentally, that is what I suspect of the Zodiac - a sudden break in the murders caused by the fear of his encounter with Fouke and Zelms - and then permanent dormancy, kept stable due to meeting and entering a lengthy relationship with a woman - possibly a divorcée with a child).

930,xisaloser,[],1633134268,"I’ve found that the more I read about “mysterious” cases, the less interested I am in a lot of them because they’re always followed by “oh, but what *actually* happened” and oftentimes the explanation seems so… simple/logical? 


It’s especially prominent with all “mysteries” from the wilderness where someone disappeared and it turns into this whole “how could they disappear, so easily in the woods” which… it’s far *too* easy to disappear in the woods. There’s nothing mysterious or fascinating about it. Someone was unprepared/got lost/had an accident and the elements got to them. Not to mention how easy it is to miss a body. 


Of course, an obvious case that comes to mind is Maura Murray. She was clearly unwell mentally, judged to be at risk of suicide, drank, and then disappeared in the woods [(mentioned here)](https://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/02/14/hanson_woman_21_missing_after_crash/). How’s that case such a huge mystery? 


Another example of cases that just aren’t too gripping are those where someone was clearly depressed. Let’s look at Connie Converse. I actually like her case because I like her music, but I don’t find it too mysterious. She was a singer-songwriter who apparently “up and disappeared” one day, but it’s very clear to me that she committed suicide. Literally all of her friends and family said she was depressed and they were actively trying to cheer her up. When she left, she asked her brother to pay for her health insurance up to a point and then stop [(as stated here).](https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234900/http://www.theawl.com/2010/08/the-story-of-connie-converse) I know that it’s very cool to think that she’s another Sugarman who created some brilliant music and disappeared only to be found decades later, but I mean… 


So, do you guys have any cases (especially popular ones) where you’re just not too interested because the reasons behind them seem obvious to you?",What unresolved cases don’t excite you anymore/never interested you because you think that their explanation is mundane?

San Diego police identify woman in 22-year cold case

On Jan. 24, 2000, SDFD firefighters found the body of 21-year-old Nicole Weis wrapped in burning cardboard secured with a rope in the parking lot of a church.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY, Calif. — Investigators are seeking the public's help Thursday to generate leads in a 22-year-old case involving the death of a woman who remained unidentified until last year.

On Jan. 24, 2000, San Diego Fire Department firefighters found the body of 21-year-old Nicole Weis wrapped in burning cardboard secured with a rope in the parking lot of the College Avenue Baptist Church, 4747 College Ave., according to the San Diego Police Department.

No suspects have been named, and up until last year, the victim was unknown to police.

In 2020, investigators used investigative genetic genealogy -- technology previously unavailable -- to identify Weis, Officer Mark Herring said.

Anyone who knew Weis or has information relating to her murder was asked to call the San Diego Police Department's Homicide Unit at 619-531-2293, or anonymously using Crime Stoppers, 888-580-8477",San Diego police identify woman in 22-year cold case
932,red23dotme,[],1633106132,"Seven years ago, my friend [Paul Bush](https://i.imgur.com/3oXW43r.jpg) spent a few weeks organising a stag-do in Budapest for his buddy and Racing Post columnist Steve Palmer (the groom), twelve people in total would travel from England to attend. Paul was 36 years old at the time, and I remember him enthusiastically telling me about how epic the event was going to be. He arranged a nightclub crawl with a company called “AllNightCrash”, and the party was met by a guide at 9pm at Liszt Ferenc Square in Budapest on 29th August 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

Paul was later captured on CCTV at 1:49am entering a building on Andrássy Avenue, [an eleven minute walk](https://i.imgur.com/Su2W7kh.png) away from the “Instant” club where he was last seen by his friends. He was accompanied by a woman in a white dress thought to be a prostitute (she was also seen accessing the building earlier). At around 2am, the same woman was seen leaving the building along with another woman and a man. Paul had lost his life, and the Budapest police were unable to identify the three people involved.

&amp;nbsp;

Paul’s body was discovered in the foyer of the building by a resident’s family member at around 8:30am, his death caused by (according to the autopsy) “injuries sustained in a fall from a height, ground slam into traumatic shock”. And “the alcohol test conducted a median of 2.602 per thousand blood, urine was 3.209 per thousand ethyl alcohol detected. On this basis, the deceased was at the time of his death in severe influence of alcohol”.

&amp;nbsp;

The autopsy revealed he suffered the following injuries (translated from Hungarian): A bruise and fracture to the left temple, epithelial tissue damage to the forearm, right hip and both knee joints, both feet and the crushing of the ankles. Extensive soft tissue bleeding to the anterior surface of the left shoulder and the neck, damaged spine and multiple damage to the ribs, with a breakage of the surrounding soft tissues causing extensive bleeding. Damage to the parietal pleura and left upper lobe of the lung apex, multiple fracture of the left shoulder blade, 1500ml of blood in the left thoracic cavity, multiple fractured damage to the left clavicle. Slight displacement and fracture of the left temporal bone, fracture of the left and right facial occipital linear, with no displacement fracture. Acute, traumatic edema of the brain, both parietal lobes, bleeding surface of the left temporal lobe pituitary soft cover, the pharynx, the larynx, the trachea and bloody mucus found in the bronchi. Besides the above, the coronary arteries indicated heart disease had been present.

&amp;nbsp;

Paul’s shirt was unbuttoned and his jeans partly pulled off. His socks and shoes had been removed and were found near his body, his mobile phone and wallet had been stolen. The Budapest police said that “the death was the result of an accident, crime data suggest (third persons) suspicions or circumstance has arisen.” In the space of roughly ten minutes, it is my opinion that Paul was led up several flights of stairs by the woman in the white dress, and was then met by her accomplices. At which point, while heavily intoxicated, Paul was pushed over the bannisters and on to the wooden concierge structure below. The three then made their way down the stairs and I believe Paul’s jeans were loosened to allow access to his wallet and mobile phone, and I think his shoes and socks were taken off in case he’d hidden money in them. They then exited the building leaving Paul dying on the floor.

&amp;nbsp;

Later that morning his friends arrived at the local police station, enquiring as to whether there was any news of Mr Bush’s disappearance. The police presented a photograph of Paul, and told them he was dead.

&amp;nbsp;

Known as ‘The Champs-Elysees of Budapest’, an affluent area and the building at [17 Andrássy Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Budapest,+Andrássy+út+17,+1061+Hungary/@47.501229,19.0574346,3a,75y,134.82h,98.48t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skkyZ6P4S_HUAejyukOLiBA!2e0!5s20140501T000000!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x4741dc6bb05b96e7:0x8ba4dc4e3d939eea!8m2!3d47.501077!4d19.057607) seems far from the “sex den” and “brothel” reported by many British tabloids. The front door appears to be opened via a buzzer entry system, so at least one of the three people would have had access to the code, or known someone residing inside. Alternatively, they managed to gain access to the building and were using it to lure people back and rob them.

&amp;nbsp;

The Budapest police were far from helpful according to Dorset Police, especially when they dismissed the possibility of murder. Mr Sheriff Payne (Dorset coroner) said he was not satisfied Mr Bush's death had been an accident, and could not rule out foul play. He said: “The implication of Hungarian authorities is he has fallen off the stairs on to the roof. That accounts for the injuries not normally caused by a straight fall to the ground.” Hungarian police said 'foul play cannot be ruled out' but that they had closed the investigation ruling it was an accident.

&amp;nbsp;

A while later, Paul’s fiancé was contacted by a Budapest resident via Facebook, saying he had found Mr Bush’s discarded bank cards.

&amp;nbsp;

A Hungarian website reported on the incident, [here’s the translated version](https://www-borsonline-hu.translate.goog/aktualis/felmeztelen-holttest-hevert-a-pesti-berhazban/86237?_x_tr_sl=hu&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-GB&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui,elem) along with photos from the scene.

933,CountLeroy,[],1633101058,"Leakin Park is part of a 1200 acre woodland area in or around Baltimore, Maryland. The park contains roughly 30 walking/hiking trails and other activities. Seems peaceful, yeah.

Sadly though, the park is probably most known for being the location that Hae Min Lee ,of the famous Serial podcast, was found in 1999.

Through the Serial podcast it was mentioned that the, I guess you could say inside joke around the area, was that while you were trying to bury a body you would find another.

So, just how many bodies are in the woods of Leakin Park? How many missing people can be found there?

The first sad case I would put as a good possibility is a teacher from the Baltimore area names Oliver Munson. Oliver vanished after heading into his teaching job at  Ellicot City Middle School. His car was found a couple of days later two blocks from his home. The right front tire was flat. Interesting to note that receipts belonging to Oliver were found in a  1973 Datsun 240Z  parked just outside of Leakin Park. This was a car previously owned by Oliver. He was unaware when he bought it that it was stolen. A tragic occurrence that likely played a role in his probable death.

It seems entirely possible that Oliver was sadly murdered and buried somewhere inside Leakin Park.

934,Kagedeah,[],1633096923,"For decades the crimes of a notorious serial killer have haunted the Paris crime squad.

&amp;#x200B;

But now a former military police officer is said to have confessed to being the murderer known as Le Grêlé - the pockmarked man - before his death.

&amp;#x200B;

Named locally as François Vérove, his DNA has been matched to several crime scenes linked to Le Grêlé.

&amp;#x200B;

His murders and rapes shocked Paris between 1986 and 1994 but until now were never solved.

&amp;#x200B;

Among the shocking crimes attributed to him was the murder of 11-year-old Cécile Bloch. She was reported missing after failing to show up to school in Paris in 1986.

&amp;#x200B;

""We won't ever know all the crimes Le Grêlé committed,"" said Didier Saban, a lawyer representing the families.

&amp;#x200B;

Vérove is linked to four murders and six rapes but Mr Saban said there were undoubtedly more, and his death had left many families without answers.

&amp;#x200B;

A picture of Le Grêlé has hung for decades on the walls of the criminal brigade of the Paris judicial police.

&amp;#x200B;

This cold case was finally cracked when an investigating magistrate recently decided to send letters to 750 gendarmes (military police) stationed in the Paris region at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

The 59-year-old man found dead had been a gendarme before becoming a police officer and later retiring, He was summoned by police on 24 September to give a DNA sample five days later. His wife reported him missing on 27 September.

&amp;#x200B;

His body was discovered in a rented flat in Grau-du-Roi on the Mediterranean coast, along with a suicide note. Prosecutors says his DNA matched evidence found at several crime scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

The contents of the letter have not been confirmed but French reports say he confessed to experiencing ""previous impulses"" while saying he had since ""got himself together"". He apparently admitted murders without detailing the victims or circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Le Grêlé's nickname dates back to evidence given at the time of Cécile Bloch's murder.

&amp;#x200B;

The victim's half-brother, Luc Richard, was among residents who recalled seeing a man with an acne-scarred face on the day of the crime in their apartment building in the 19th district of northern Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

Bloch's body was later found under a piece of old carpet in the basement. Officials said she had been raped, strangled and stabbed, and the case sent shockwaves across France.

&amp;#x200B;

Her brother, who helped police draw a sketch of the suspect, remembered sharing a lift with the man, who seemed ""very sure of himself"".

&amp;#x200B;

""He said something to me like, 'Have a very, very good day,'"" he recalled in an interview with the Sud Ouest newspaper in 2015. Mr Richard has previously spoken about how the case has haunted him, saying he has lived with a ""great feeling of injustice"".

&amp;#x200B;

DNA evidence linked Ms Bloch's killer to other murders and rapes.

&amp;#x200B;

This included the 1987 killing of 38-year-old Gilles Politi and his German au pair Irmgard Müller.

&amp;#x200B;

Local reports say he was linked to the 1994 murder of 19-year-old Karine Leroy, who was found dead on the edge of a wood more than a month after disappearing while on her way to school.

&amp;#x200B;

In rapes committed against a 26-year-old German woman and two girls, aged 14 and 11, the suspect is reported to have identified himself as a policeman.

&amp;#x200B;

""We had this conviction that he was either an officer or a gendarme, both from the violence he used against his victims and the tactics he adopted,"" the lawyer representing the victims told France Info TV. Sometimes he would even present his card with the French tricolor on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr Saban believed the killer had done all he could to ensure his DNA was not left at crime scenes. But now his identity has been revealed he wants unsolved crimes to be reopened in which DNA techniques were never used.

935,annemoriarty,[],1633096413,"On April 11, 1953, a 21-years-old woman called Wilma Montesi was found dead on a public beach in Torvaianica, near Rome. Her mysterious death led to prolonged investigations around the allegations of drug parties and sex orgies in the Roman high society. Two members of the Roman high society were investigated, causing a big scandal in Italy. Subsequently they were both absolved of all charges. The case remains unsolved, including the exact circumstances of her death.

[Sorry for any mistakes, English in not my native language. I hope that everything is understandable!]



- The discovery of her body


Wilma Montesi was born in 1932 in Rome: her family was of modest origin, her father worked as a carpenter and her mother was a housewife. They all lived in Rome. At the time of her disappearance she was engaged to a policeman (who was working in Potenza at that time) whom she was going to marry in seven months. She was considered to be very beautiful and wanted to be an actress (she had already acted in small roles in movies). Everyone described her as reserved, elegant and really excited for her wedding.


On April 11, 1953 (the day before Easter), around 7:30 am, her body was discovered on a public beach in Torvaianica, near Rome. She had been missing since April 9.
Her body was found by a worker who was having breakfast on the beach. She was lying in a prone position, her head was immersed in the water. She was partially dressed and her clothes were soaked: her shoes, skirt, stockings, suspenders and her handbag were missing. The doctor that had arrived on the scene stated that her body was not stiff and she had probably died 18-24 hours before. He thought that it was an accidental death or a suicide.



- Wilma's disappearance


When the news of the discovery was disclosed newspapers came out with extensive articles, although the investigators had banned the access to the mortuary where the body of the victim was kept. Nevertheless, a reporter managed to gain access and see the body. The description he provided appeared in the newspaper the next day and it allowed her father to show up to identify the body.
From the reconstruction of the last moments of her life it emerged that she had not returned home for dinner on the evening of April 9, which was unusual. Her mother, along with her other daughter, had spent the afternoon at the cinema and stated that Wilma had declined to join them and said that she would probably go out for a walk. After returning home, the two women noticed that Wilma was not there; strangely she had left home without her identification and her jewellery (that were gifts from her boyfriend she usually wore when she went out). She didn't show up for dinner, that was at 8 pm every day. At 10:30 pm her father reported her missing to the Police.


The Police started to investigate possible witnesses.
The concierge of the building where the family lived claimed to have seen her leaving the building around 5:30 pm.
Another witness claimed to have seen her around 5:30 pm on the train from Rome to Ostia: but Ostia is around 20 km (12,4 miles) from Torvaianica (where her body was found), too far to travel on foot, especially by someone not familiar with the area. It also takes one hour by train to go from her home to Ostia. Another witness claimed to have seen her on the beach in Ostia around 6 pm that day. Then the owner of a kiosk located near a beach in Ostia claimed to have spoken with a young woman resembling Wilma, who had bought an illustrated postcard and had told her that she intended to send it to her boyfriend in Potenza. Her fiancé was informed of Wilma's disappearance and arrived in Rome before her body was discovered. He wasn't suspected to be involved in her death and was in Potenza at the time of her disappearance (228 miles away).
On the day of Wilma's funeral, the family received an anonymous letter, in which the unknown sender stated that the girl didn't die as a result of an accident, but that she was killed by a suitor who did not intend to accept her marriage to a other man. Nobody, however, paid any attention to the message.
The inconsistencies of the witnesses' timeline was immediatly the biggest problem in understanting which sightings were legit.


- The accidental death theory


The body was brought to the Institute of Medicine in Rome, where an autopsy was conducted: the doctors claimed that the probable cause of death was a ""syncope due to a foot bath,"" claiming that, most likely, Montesi had eaten an ice cream (remains were found in her stomach) and wet her feet in the sea to relieve an irritation on her feet that she had for some time. To do so, Montesi had taken off her shoes, socks, skirt and suspenders. Then she had dived in the water where she fainted and drowned. The coroner connected her sudden illness to the fact that the woman was menstruating. It was argued that she could have died the same day she went missing, not the day after.
The distance between Ostia (the presumed last sighting of Montesi) and the beach were she was discovered was justified by saying that the body had been moved by complex combinations of sea currents. An autopsy revealed that the young woman was a virgin and that she had not experienced violence (as evidenced by the fact that the make up was still on her face and her nail polish was intact); later, however, another doctor said that the presence of sand in her intimate parts could be explained only as a consequence of violence.
The accidental death theory was considered reliable by the police, who closed the case. However, newspapers were sceptical.



- Piero Piccioni and the political scandal


On May 4 the newspaper ""Roma"" suggested the hypothesis of a secret plot to cover up the real killers, some powerful political personalities; the hypothesis was presented in the article ""Why is the police silent on the death of Wilma Montesi?"". The newspaper claimed that Wilma had been seen with the son of a famous politican on a beach in Ostia, 10 days before she disappeared.
This hypothesis was shared by prestigious national newspapers such as ""Corriere della Sera"" and by gossip magazines such as ""Attualità"". This hypotesis was echoed by almost all local and national newspapers.


On 24 May 1953 another article (published in the magazine ""Vie Nuove"") had big success: the man seen with Wilma (known as ""the blond"") was identified by a newspaper as Piero Piccioni. Piccioni was a film score composer, the lover of Alida Valli [famous Italian actress] and the son of Attilio Piccioni [who was Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and a major exponent of the Christian Democrats, the biggest political party at that time].
The name ""blond"" had also been attributed to Piccioni by the newspaper ""Paese Sera"": an article published on May 5 by the journalist Marco Sforza claimed that a witness saw a blond young man bringing the missing garments of the murdered girl to a police station . The identification of the blond man as Piero Piccioni was a known fact to all journalists, but no one had revealed the identity to the general public yet. The news caused uproar because it was published shortly before the 1953 Italian election.



Piero Piccioni sued the journalist and the editor of ""Vie Nuove"" for defamation. Sforza was subjected to a harsh interrogation. The Italian Communist Party, owner of the newspaper ""Vie Nuove"", initially refused to recognize the work of the journalist, who was accused of ""sensationalism"" and threatened with dismissal.
Even under interrogation, Sforza never directly quoted the name of the official source from which the news came, saying only that it came from ""the faithful people of De Gasperi"" [leader and founder of the Democratic Christians]
Even the journalist's father, a professor of philosophy at Sapienza University in Rome, suggested to his son to recant.
Sforza's lawyer made an agreement with the journalist and on May 31  Sforza recanted his statements. Later, Piccioni dropped the charge.


Although, for the moment, a scandal for the Christian Democrats was excluded, Piccioni's name would later return to prominence.
Meanwhile, during the summer, the case disappeared from the newspapers.



- Adriana Bisaccia and the ""capocottari"" hypothesis


 On October 6, in the tabloid ""Attualità"", the journalist and editor of the magazine Silvano Muto published an article. Muto had conducted a journalistic investigation into the ""beautiful world"" of Rome, based on the story of a 23-year-old actress called Adriana Bisaccia, who also worked as a typist. 
The girl had told the journalist that she had participated with Wilma in an orgy, which was held in Capocotta, not far from the place where the body was discovered. It was an occasion to meet famous people, mainly Roman nobility and children of politicians.
 According to her story, Montesi had taken a lethal quantity of drugs and alcohol. Her lifeless body was later carried on the beach by some participants of the orgy, where it was abandoned. Among the names mentioned in the article there were Piero Piccioni and the Marquis Ugo Montagna, owner of the Capocotta estate. The participants in the orgy, defined by the press as ""capocottari"", represented Roman high society, and it was easy for the public to see a Police cover up aimed at protecting these characters.
Wilma Montesi's death was filed and declared an accident, while the journalist Silvano Muto was sued and forced to go to court. In the beginning Muto partially retracted his theses, stating that they were products of his imagination, only to then deny his retraction. Bisaccia, afraid and perhaps threatened, denied her statements, but would later go on to say that they were truthful.



- The deposition of Moneta Caglio 


 After the story of Bisaccia a second girl released another compromising statement. The woman, Moneta Caglio, was the daughter of a Milanese notary. She said that, like Bisaccia and Wilma, she was trying to get into the world of cinema. She had become Montagna's lover, who was a person around whom the world of Roman VIPs revolved. The girl had met the prosecutor of the case twice and on both occasions had made a deposition on the affair, but was always ignored. 
She stated that Wilma had become the new lover of Montagna, then she said that she had heard a phone call between Montagna and Piccioni, with the latter asking his friend to accompany him to the Police because they were blaming him for Wilma's death. She had started to suspect Picconi and Montagna's involvement, so she had turned to her uncle, a priest, to ask for instructions on what to do. Her uncle referred the girl to a Jesuit priest, Father Alessandro Dall'Oglio, to whom she confirmed the responsibility of Piccioni and Montagna, consistent with what was written in the newspapers. Through Dall'Oglio's work, the document reached Amintore Fanfani, then Minister of the Interior, who helped to suspend the trial for the journalist Silvano Muto, as his theory was no longer the bizarre invention of a provocative journalist. 



- New investigations and trial


Fanfani entrusted a new investigation into the case. The result of the report was full of guilty implications:  that would link Piccioni, Montagna and the leaders of the Roman law enforcement agencies to Wilma's homicide.
On March 26, 1954 the case was officially reopened. On September 19 the scandal was such that Attilio Piccioni [Piero's father] resigned as Foreign Minister. Two days later, Piero Piccioni and Ugo Montagna were arrested on the charge of manslaughter. Together with them was arrested the commissioner of Rome, Saverio Polito, accused of aiding and abetting (according to the accusation he had tried to cover up the truth). 
A new medical-legal report was issued. The results, however, were not in agreement with the previous accidental death theory. Montesi's death was placed between 8 and 20 hours before the discovery of her body. Five suspicious bruises were also found on her body. It was suggested that Wilma was attacked and then abandoned unconcious on the shore, where she slowly drowned. The sand found in her lungs was not consistent with the sand on Torvaianica's beach, suggesting that her body had been moved. The ice cream was eaten three to four hours before her death. Her virginity was confirmed, but it was not excluded the possibility of other sexual violence. 

 

On January 21, 1957 the trial against Piccioni, Montagna and Polito started. Montagna denied knowing Wilma Montesi, and Polito, now retired, confirmed the official hypotesis of the accidental death. Alida Valli [Piccioni's lover] deposed in Piccioni's favor, confirming that the days before Wilma's disappearance Piero Piccioni was with her in Amalfi. He left that location on April 9, returning to his home in Rome shortly after 2 pm and a few hours later (6 pm) he was in the office of a well-known clinician for a visit, because he complained of severe pain in the throat. At the suggestion of the doctor he had gone to bed and remained there the next day too (a nurse, another doctor and his friends could testify this). However, the alibi was already known to investigators in the investigation phase. The witnesses statements about the identification of Piccioni as the ""blond"" were also declared unreliable.


On May 28, the court recognized the defendants innocent and acquitted them.
Muto's trial for the accusations of slander ended with a two-year sentence for the journalist and a ten-month sentence for Bisaccia. Moneta Caglio was also subjected to trial and was sentenced to 2 years in 1966.



- A new lead: ""Uncle Giuseppe"" 


Despite everything, however, Wilma Montesi's parents were certain of Piero Piccioni's innocence. And on September 30 the journalist Fabrizio Menghini (who had followed the case continuously) put forward the veiled hypothesis that there could also be clues in another direction: towards the victim's uncle Giuseppe Montesi .
Giuseppe, who was a young man, had been very attached to Wilma, if not actually in love with her, so much so that on several occasions he invited her to break her engagement.
To worsen his position, at least in the eyes of the tabloid press, Giuseppe Montesi was considered, for the time, a libertine, one who boasted of his many adventures and maintained relationships with people of dubious reputation. He also owned a car that he could have used to bring Wilma, alive or dead, to the place of the discovery . 
The hypothesis was taken seriously by the public opinion. The evasive behavior of Giuseppe Montesi contributed to make the thesis credible: initially, in fact, he did not want to say where he was on the night of the murder. Later, questioned by the judges, he admitted that he was spending the evening with his girlfriend's sister, from whom he later had two children. Despite his strange behaviour he was never investigated further or trialed for her death.



- Other leads


The truth about the case has remained unknown. In 2015 the journalist and criminologist Pasquale Ragone revived the case by recovering and publishing the documentation that was believed to have been lost, from the very first investigations in Ostia to the post-archives investigations . According to Ragone, the death of the girl was due to events attributable entirely to her private affairs, citing a strand of investigation  not taken into consideration. To date, it is the last reconstruction on the Wilma Montesi case. Some of the possibile leads that were not investigated are explored here:


1) The relationship between Wilma and her boyfriend was not investigated deeply enough. Her family said that it was anything but serene and idyllic. Wanda Montesi, Wilma's sister, stated “Wilma loved Angelo, but I think she did not feel physical attraction for him. She kept him at a distance and, before each of his visits to us, she loaded her lips with lipstick: she was looking for an excuse not to kiss him even on the cheek ”. Wilma's mother stated: “Once, Angelo and Wilma went out alone to go to the cinema. She came back late, serious and confused. […] When Angelo left, Wilma - who never hid anything from me - told me that they didn't go to the cinema but to Villa Borghese. They sat on a bench and he tried to 'stretch out his hands', but Wilma immediately rejected him: until the wedding, she wanted no sexual advances"".


2) After the girl's death, it emerged that, unbeknownst to her parents, Wilma had ordered a suit worth 60,000 lire (a very considerable figure at the time) from a well-known Roman tailor's shop, an unusual circumstance given the modest economic conditions of her family. Nobody knew the motivation for this purchase.


3) The anonymous message received by the family on the day of Wilma's funeral was completely neglected.


4) According to some experts, the possibility that the girl's body could have been transported by the sea currents from Ostia to Torvaianica should be excluded: in that stretch of sea, according to them, these currents would have gone in the opposite direction. Moreover, the state of the body was not consistent with a body that had been in the water for one or two days.


5) Dark stains were found on her face: it seems that the medical examiners had not come to an unambiguous conclusion about their origin; the same medical examiners, during the autopsy, did not carry out blood tests, limiting themselves to ascertaining the absence of drugs in her stomach.



6) The absence of the suspender belt is not in any way congruent with the hypothesis of the foot bath; the other missing clothes and bag are very suspiciois too. It also appears unlikely that the young woman had gone to an appointment of the type hypothesized by the newspapers while wearing  mended and torn undergarments.


7) According to the accidental death theory Wilma went out well after 5 pm to go for a foot bath in Ostia, which is an hour away from Rome by train, while knowing that at her house they categorically dined at 8 pm. Moreover, being April, the sun would have already set at 7 pm. The sea conditions of that afternoon - stormy - should have dissuaded her from her intent. Moreover, the sand found in her lungs was not consistent with the sand found on the Torvaianica beach, suggesting that her body had been moved.



- My 2 cents


Obviously this is just speculation and my simple opinion. I think that the accidental death theory was not credible. She had no reason to go to Ostia and it was very unusual that she didn't tell her family that she wouldnt be home for dinner. She had no motivation to take off her suspenders or skirt to wet her feet. And the fact that her clothes and bag were missing is really suspicious and points to foulplay.


The ""capocottari"" hypotesis is also very unlikely. It was the first big media circus in Italy and the political motivations are very suspicious. I think that her death was used as a political pawn before the elections. I think that there's little to no proof of Picconi and Montagna's involvement. We know that cover ups for powerful people are not unlikely and we had another example in Italy of terrible violence commited by young, rich, infulencial people: the Circeo massacre (https://emadion.it/en/tortures/the-circeo-massacre/), but I think that it's not the case here. The statements from witnesses of the ""blond man"" and Bisaccia/Caglio's statements are dubious at best.



I think that she was killed on the evening of her disappearance. In her stomach they found ice cream but no dinner. That day 
she either had an appointment with someone or was attacked by a stranger in a location near Torvaianica, probably on another beach. I think she was indeed on the beach in Ostia at one point and that at least one of her sightings was true. The man she met tried to sexually assualt her but didn't manage to (or maybe he did, after all the idea that sexual assault always leaves physical signs is not true, moreover I don't really trust the medical examiners to be 100% truthful about it, since it was 1953 and this topic was considered shameful by society at large). He could have suffocated her, she became unconcious and he thought he had killed her. He left her on the shore where she slowly drowned. He took her clothes and bag and disposed of them. Later he trasported her body (maybe by car) to the Torvaianica beach, where her body was discovered. The tricky part is why was her body moved? We know that she had probably died on another beach because the sand found in her lungs was diffrent from Torvaianica's sand. Maybe the beach where she drowned was frequented during the night and he thought that her body would be discovered too soon (for example, Ostia's beach is frequented a lot). I have no idea. But I'm pretty sure that her body was not in the sea for one or two days. 


I think that the anonymous message sent to the family could have been truthful. It was sent before all the media circus began, when Wilma was ""just"" another ordinary dead girl. We also know that most women are killed by a man they know. Maybe the killer was someone she had met while trying to become a famous actress. I think that it would have been easy for her to have an affair, since her fiancé was working and living miles away. According to the family statements it doesn't seem that her fiancé could be responsible but their relationship seemed to have problems. I think that her uncle Giuseppe was suspicious and a weird character, but he was probably just trying to hide the relationship with his girlfriend's sister. It's a shame that the media circus and political scandal moved the investigations and caused her death to remain unsolved. I hope that one day we'll have answers but I fear that this case will remain unsolved.



RIP Wilma

Also this write up may be boring for some as I focused partially on autopsies which played important roles in this case. So if you don’t like it you might be disappointed.

**The Story**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;  

[Kramnys](https://imgur.com/a/RBXi9zg) were typical middle class Czech family married since 2007 while their daughter Klara was already 2 years old. On 25th of July 2013 they decided to spend vacation in Hurghada in Egypt  - very popular vacation destination for Czech families. They booked accommodation in hotel Titanic Palace.

There are several rules you need to follow when going to such a destination. One of them is not to drink the tap water. It probably contains different bacteria and Europeans are not immune against it unlike the locals. Common symptoms are similar to gastric flu and if taken medication they pass in couple of days. It’s not unheard of some food poisoning either but usually symptoms might be similar because the food is made of the same tap water and if not boiled properly you still can get sick of it.

So, when on 30th of July all 3 family members got sick it probably looked like food poisoning. At least Petr Kramny declares it. He mentioned he had the worst symptoms unlike girls who were sick but not as much as him. Yet he was only one who survived. Monika and Klara were lying in bed while Peter woke up around 10 pm and went to drink something. When he came back, he tried to shake Klara to move a bit but she was unresponsive. 

He felt she is cold and stiff, switched the lights on and found she is dead with dark stains on her body. He started with resuscitation and called for his wife to wake her up. Unfortunately, wife was unresponsive too. He was facing her back and couldn’t wake her up. Then he slapped her back, ran towards her side of bed and found her purple faced with eyes and mouth open 

Just at 3 am he called woman from neighboring room and once she has seen two bodies, she called hotel reception. Hotel doctor made some body examination but couldn’t determine cause of death. As of his statement he didn’t find any traces of violence such as stab wounds, traces of strangulation or broken bones. He also orders stomach irrigation for Peter Kramny due to possible poisoning. 
Egyptian attorney orders examination of the room and bodies, taking samples for lab analyses and orders autopsy of both bodies. Despite of official protocol that room must be sealed, some sources state that room was cleaned within few hours and ready for new guests.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;



**Autopsy in Egypt**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

 



According Wikipedia autopsy showed both stomachs were completely burned due to strong poison similar to cyanide. Unlikely. Klarka was much smaller and strong poison would have killed her most probably much sooner than Monika but they died almost at the same time. I read record from Egyptian autopsy (samples taken from stomach, kednies and intestines) and lab tests showed, no traces of toxic, alkalic, anesthetics or sedatives substances were found.

Coroner admits in conclusion that they still could have been poisoned despite negative chemical analysis once toxin could have been absorbed and changed its composition. Bodies were significantly dehydrated due to diarrhea which was another possibility of cause of death.  

  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp; 





**Petr Kramny**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;    





In the meantime, Petr’s behavior becomes very odd. He is forbidden to leave Egypt as he was still suspect in the case but starts talking to media on daily bases. He looks like he enjoys the attention and for the person who doesn’t know him he seems he is not devastated a one bit. He is talking about the case, has this inappropriate half grin in the face all the time and slowly is gaining the reputation of possible murderer. Media hungry for sensational information are travelling to Hurghada and waiting for every word he is saying.

And he is not catching attention of ordinary people only. Czech authorities and investigators started paying attention to Peter’s interviews too. They hire experts to establish psychological profile and various analysts to watch his behavior. This is the point where he is probably digging his own hole. Either it’s just his coping mechanism or he is plain stupid, naïve, self-centered, or simply psychopath. He also calls Insurance office with all documentation ready to answer any question they might have. This could have been normal procedure but in the context of given circumstances it was another nail to his coffin. 

On 8th of August 2013 two bodies were transported to Czech Republic and re-autopsy is ordered while Petr is still not allowed to leave Egypt until investigation is closed.

After autopsy the bodies can be buried, and Petr is watching the ceremony throughout the video. At the end of October Egyptian authorities concluded there is no evidence of crime, Petr obtained his passport and travelled back home. Then he visited the grave of his family and cried while media were shooting it. Later it was discovered he got paid for allowing media to be present and publish his crying pictures. 

It also didn’t help whenever he talked to media, he never called his wife or daughter by name. He always referred to them as “she”, “my wife”, “my daughter”. I am not psychologist so not sure if this is any of significance, but any kind of distance can be hint of anything out of ordinary.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;  





**Autopsy in Czech Republic**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;  





And then bombshell came. Re-autopsy. Here are final conclusions I read:

Both autopsies concluded that no toxic substances were found however as a cause of death
was determined heart failure of each of them. 

“After excluding all these external factors that may cause immediate cessation of basic vital functions, i.e., excluding all other possible causes of heart failure, it was evaluated as the remaining viable alternative is **electric shock** (""method of determination is “per exclusion"").
“Per Exclusion” is Latin expression and basically means that in the field of medicine you exclude all possible diagnoses until only one is left. 

“This cause of death further corresponds to a complex autopsy finding on organs, both macroscopic and microscopic. In both victims, pulmonary edema and cerebral edema were found, as well as congestion of the internal organs, a dilated heart and blood effusions under the pericardial organ leaf. Histological examination of the heart revealed the so-called ""bark like myocardium"" in both victims, ie fragmentation of myocardial muscle fibers with their chaotic arrangement and overlap (appearance of the tree bark) and the so-called wave syndrome, i.e. deposits of ripples, zigzag arrangement of the myocardium. These findings suggest an electric shock.

After this Czech Team of investigators travelled to Egypt to examine the crime scene but they were not allowed to enter and collect any evidence.

There is also problem how he could have possibly managed it technically. 
Explanation gave the prosecutor during the trial. [Petr](https://imgur.com/a/bqGixdr) appeared in much better shape, he lost some weight and visibly spent some time in the gym, wearing the same grin as before. 
Experts came with two options how the crime could have happened.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;  





**1.st Option**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;    





The first variant assumes that the mother and daughter were in the shower and standing on a damp, i.e., electrically conductive floor. Subsequently, it would be enough for the killer to apply a conductive cable to the body of one of them. ""It is assumed that the living part (conductor) will be attached to the person's neck,"" the expert states in the report. They agree with the forensic doctor, who found a burn seven inches long and one centimeter wide on the back of Monika Kramna's neck.

The mother also had other burns on her back and left calf. Her daughter Klarka Kramna only had her right thigh burned, but the medical examiner admitted the variant that the current could enter her body through her right hand, i.e., after touching her mother, into which the perpetrator was letting an electric current. ""The death of both people as a result of, for example, holding each other at the moment of the application of tension, cannot be ruled out,"" the report said. In addition, Monika Kramna had a number of large bruises on her body, which could have occurred after a fall in the shower due to cramps after a dose of electricity.

Experts believe that a short time in the matter of seconds, when electricity flows in the body, is enough for severe shock, convulsions and falling into unconsciousness.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;  





**2.nd Option**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;   





The second option says that the perpetrator committed a double murder in a bed in a hotel room. In that case, he would have to kill Monika and Klárka separately. This possibility is indicated by the positions of the victims' bodies as they were found. ""For example, an uninsulated cable cord with a plug, which is plugged into a socket at the bedside table, can be used as a design tool,"" experts say. According to them, a bedside table could also play a role, in which the cables were without or only with basic insulation. Then it would be enough to simply pull them out and attach them to the body.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp; 






**Trial Verdict**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;   





“He did not want to allow humiliation,"" the judge said of the motive for which Kramny had murdered for. ""He made a story of poisoning for that.""

According to the court, Kramny had information about his wife's infidelity. He confided to a well-known witness that they did not live sexually. And that they also slept in twin beds in Egypt. 

*""So the court definitely considers it proven that the defendant increasingly controlled his wife, which is also based on the testimony of another witness,"" the judge reminded. In addition, Kramný shows signs of personality disorder - he is afraid of rejection by women.

""This senate has no doubts that the killing was carried out by Petr Kramný and that the killing took place by electric current,"" the judge said.*

Kramny defended himself that he did not understand electricity - so he could not kill his wife and daughter with an extension cord with a stripped end, as the public prosecutor claimed. In addition, no murderous instrument was found. *""No particularly sophisticated knowledge is needed to prepare a deadly tool,"" the judge said. ""It cannot be overlooked that the defendant is skilled, and as for the effects of electricity, they are generally known.""*

“I am adamantly convinced that he is guilty, ""the prosecutor Vít Legerský stated in his closing speech. The motive Kramny allegedly had: marital conflicts. ,”he takes partner break up as a personal humiliation. He is narcissistic, egocentric, relational and has a tendency to increasingly control a woman. This combination can lead to the release of aggression - suicide or murder. ""

According to the indictment, the case involved so-called widespread suicide. ""He wanted to kill his wife, daughter and eventually himself. But then he apparently did not find enough courage to commit suicide. An examination by a psychologist revealed a very high score for suicidal tendencies,"" judge Gil said. According to the judge, the version about widespread suicide is also supported by the fact that he chose a closed hotel room for the act. ""If that idea weren't in the background, he would have chosen to kill in other circumstances, in other places.""

The indictment was built without a single direct evidence. No murder weapon was found, which was supposed to be the extension cord. Even the witnesses saw nothing specific. And there were also no traces of the crime scene that would connect Kramny with the crime.

Petr Kramny was sentenced to 28 years in jail. 

The court senate found Kramný the only mitigating circumstance that he must take into account according to the law: he has no previous record so far and has led a normal life. Therefore, he apparently did not get a full thirty years, as requested by the public prosecutor.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;







**Controversies**  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;  





Emotions aside, we don’t have to like Petr Kramny. But the simple truth is, there is not one solid evidence and there are experts who challenge autopsies conclusions. According one article I’d quote this one:

* The cause of death was not and could not be an acute heart failure in an electric shock. This is refuted by the original report of the Egyptian pathologist MUDr. Walid Nagi, who found neither a current trace nor signs of downstream interference, not on either body. This possibility is further clearly excluded by the conclusion of the expert opinion of a renowned expert in the field of cardiovascular pathology, prof. MUDr. Ivo Šteiner CSc., who confirmed a practically normal histological finding in both hearts, and therefore stated with absolute certainty that no electric shock could be considered. His very fundamental finding that in the total of four examined samples from the hearts of Monika and Klára Kramný there were no contraction strips at all.

* The forensic expert doc. MUDr. Alexandr Pilin CSc., said that it could not be demonstrably claimed that it was an electric shock. In an addendum to the expert report dated 16 July 2018, he stated: ""In none of the cuts of the skin from Monika Kramná's neck, which I received for examination, I did not find any changes indicating an electric shock.""

* Monika and Klára Kramných definitely could not have been murdered by electric shock, another medical report confirms immediately after their death. During the examination of the bodies on 30 July 2013 in room no. 6343 of the Titanic Palace Hotel, the hotel doctor stated that there were no traces of violence on the bodies and traces of strangulation on the neck. At the same time, the current trace would have to be completely obvious on the bodies, and therefore clearly visible. However, this testimony, including the protocol on the search of the bodies of Monika and Klára Kramný, was completely ignored by the Czech courts. This doctor was never heard by the courts in the Czech Republic and no court dealt with his conclusions.

I am not saying Petr is innocent, it could have happened as prosecutor suggested, but I do expect from modern society a bit more than theories of what happened and the fact that Petr wasn’t sad enough, that he called insurance office too soon and that he most probably is the victim of media hunt and didn’t think of consequences. Maybe he is also ego boosted narcist but in my eyes it’s not enough to sentence him for murder.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &amp;nbsp;

I'd like to mention too that it's not one single case of mysterious death in this Titanic Palace hotel. There was another British couple who died under similar circumstances where autopsy didn't show any traces of poisoning in the system of victims.

Petr's request to re-open the trial was rejected in 2019.

For decades the crimes of a notorious serial killer have haunted the Paris crime squad

But now a former military police officer is said to have confessed to being the murderer known as Le Grêlé - the pockmarked man - before he died.

In a suicide note, the man, named by French media as François V, said he was the killer whose crimes shocked Paris in the 1980s and 1990s.

Le Grêlé is suspected of being behind several murders and rapes.

DNA tests are yet to confirm that the man is the wanted serial killer. But the dead suspect's confession could mark the end of one of France's most notorious uncracked cases.

The killer was given his nickname in reference to his face, pockmarked by acne.

Among the shocking crimes attributed to him was the murder of 11-year-old Cécile Bloch. She was reported missing after failing to show up to school in the town of Fontainebleau in 1986.

Her body was later found under a piece of old carpet in the basement of the apartment building she lived in. Officials said she had been raped, strangled and stabbed, and the case sent shockwaves across France.

Residents, including Ms Bloch's half-brother Luc Richard, recalled seeing a man with pockmarked skin in the elevator on the day of the crime.

Mr Richard, who helped police draw a sketch of the suspect, has described the man as seeming ""very sure of himself"".

""He said something to me like, 'Have a very, very good day,'"" he recalled in an interview with the Sud Ouest newspaper in 2015.

DNA evidence linked Ms Bloch's killer to other murders and rapes.

This included the 1987 killing of 38-year-old Gilles Politi and his German au pair Irmgard Müller.

Local media reports say he has also been linked to the 1994 murder of 19-year-old Karine Leroy, who was found dead on the edge of a wood more than a month after disappearing while on her way to school.

In rapes committed against a 26-year-old German woman and two girls, aged 14 and 11, the suspect is reported to have identified himself as a policeman.

A picture of Le Grêlé has hung for decades on the walls of the criminal brigade of the Paris judicial police.

But recently there were some signs that the mysterious killer could finally be unmasked.

Reports say François V had been summoned for questioning in relation to the case and to give a DNA sample, but he did not show up.

His body was found on Wednesday in an apartment at a seaside resort near the southern city of Montpellier.

While few details have been confirmed, Le Parisien newspaper reported that François V was a 59-year-old former gendarme - a policeman attached to the French military.

Le Point newspaper reported that the man had married and had two children.

In his final message he reportedly said he was ""not well in life"" at the time of the killings, but that he had since ""got himself together"".

Mr Richard has previously spoken about how the case has haunted him, saying he has lived with a ""great feeling of injustice"".",French confession may end 35-year hunt for serial killer

The man found in the Gard, a 59-year-old former policeman, would have left a letter in which he admitted to be the killer with the pockmarked face who struck in Paris. It is within the framework of a long investigation that the police force ended up tightening the noose on this man […]

941,crime-solver,[],1633005005,"Last week I wrote about the murder of Christopher Daniel Myles.  This week my post is about the murder of another teenage boy, Jeffrey (Jeff) Batan.  His murder took place on the other side of the country in Queens New York, during the same era in 1978, a year prior to Danny’s murder.

Jeff was a student at the private school Horizon School for Perpetual Development, in Flushing, Queens.  Before this, he finished fifth grade at a church parochial school, where his 17-year-old brother Timothy and his sister Chris used to study as well.  Their older sister Martina was attending a photography school.  Their father was a doctor from the Philippines and their mother a nurse and they were separated at the time of Jeff’s murder.  The siblings were living with their mother.

Jeff started working part-time at Winther’s, a luncheonette and ice cream parlour, on Woodhaven Boulevard, Rego Park Queens two months before his murder.  A pool table was added inside the store, partly at the suggestion of Jeff who loved the game.  He was on friendly terms with all the kids in the neighbourhood according to his boss, Mr Anthony Maggio.  Jeff’s brother Timothy and sister Chris were also working at Winther’s.

&amp;#x200B;

**The murder**

On Monday, February 5, 1978, at about 11 pm Jeff left work to walk the few blocks to his home.  The next day, Tuesday morning, he was found dead on the snow at about 8.30 am.  On Monday night, Winther’s closed between 8-9 pm.  Then Jeffrey stayed to help clean up, shot some pools and left at about 11 pm.  The next day at about 8.30 am police was called when a tenant found the body lying on the snow in the courtyard of an apartment building, just north of a playground with children’s swings.  The location he was found was about four blocks from his home.  Police detectives believe that he started walking on Woodhaven Boulevard, west towards his home.  Another tenant who lived in a nearby building stated to the police that she heard a quarrel/dispute at about 2.30 am.

Jeff was stabbed between 12-20 times in the upper left chest, neck and face.  Detectives believed that he was murdered somewhere else and then transferred to the location he was found since there was little blood at the crime scene.  No weapon has ever been found.   Jeff was wearing a brown leather jack but no shirt or undershirt.  He had a wallet with no money inside and his jean trousers were unbuttoned.  There is no mention of whether foreign DNA was found.

After the murder, a parish worker commented that Jeff was a good kid.  Mr Anthony Maggio, grieving stated that ‘he wouldn’t mind having Jeffrey as a son since he was such a trustworthy and hardworking boy’.

&amp;#x200B;

**Martina**

Jeff’s sister Martina Batan became a prominent contemporary art dealer in Manhattan.  She never stopped searching for the murderer of her brother.  Unfortunately, Martina sadly passed away a few months ago in 2021.

About 10 years prior to her death Martina had hired a private detective to look into the murder of her brother.  The investigation lasted about four years.  The investigator uncovered a suspect for the murder.  Five years after Jeff’s murder, an 11-year-old boy was killed by a man in College Point, Queens.  The man convicted of this murder once lived in Rego Park.  He was briefly a suspect in Jeff’s case.  He had also stated to the police that he knew Jeff.  The private investigator also learned that Jeff was sexually assaulted prior to his murder.

&amp;#x200B;

**The suspect**

David Shapiro produced a documentary called ‘Missing People’.  Martina was contacted that her brother’s murder would be one of the cases featured in this documentary.  The documentary followed the private investigator for all four years.  The investigation concluded that police missed the connections between the murderer of the 11-year-old boy and Jeff.  Martina wasn't aware of these connections until the investigation.  She became convinced that this man was her brother’s killer.  She was planning to press the police to reopen the cold case with this new information.  Unfortunately, she had her first stroke in 2012 and her health started to deteriorate.

943,-kelsie,[],1632993225,"# IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN 30 YEARS SINCE THE UNRESOLVED DISAPPEARANCE OF KERRY A. O’BRIEN-KRUEGER, A 31-YEAR-OLD BURLINGTON WOMAN WITH A STRONG CAREER WHO WAS A MUCH-LOVED MOTHER, FRIEND, DAUGHTER, AND SISTER.

Kerry O’Brien Krueger lived in Burlington, Wisconsin with her husband Tracey and 3 year old daughter, Megan. She was employed in PR at Gander Mountain near Wilmot, Wisconsin. Her husband worked at the Burlington Standard Press newspaper as a photographer, which is how they met, as Kerry used to be an editor for the same paper..

Tracey and Kerry had an on-and-off again relationship including a *called-off engagement* before finally tying the knot. **Police learned from friends and relatives of the couple that Kerry and Tracey’s marriage was not doing well, and Kerry had confided in a friend that she was planning on filing for divorce if the relationship did not improve quickly.** In the recent Vanished podcast about this case, Kerry’s brother described Tracey as “quiet” and “just kind of there”, noting that he was never particularly involved in Kerry’s family get-togethers.

Kerry was suffering from an undiagnosed illness going on for about 6 months at the time of her disappearance which consisted of intense stomach pains, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss. The illness often left her so weak that she was forced to call into work, and could some days hardly lift her head from her pillow. She had been to numerous doctors and underwent gastrointestinal testing, but didn’t seem to be getting any definitive results. In 2014, Kerry’s sister Molly said she believed her sister was being poisoned – a belief strengthened by the fact that Tracey would not let the police take Kerry’s hairbrush as evidence during the investigation.

**On December 5, 1989, Kerry disappeared.**

Tracey claimed that Kerry had told him she was being sent to a trade show in Wyoming with someone named Jim to replace a sick co-worker. She supposedly left at 4am for a flight leaving out of the Chicago-O’Hare airport. *The investigation showed there was no trade show in Wyoming.*

The Kruegers’ house was searched, but no evidence related to the disappearance was discovered. Several of her relatives joined the search and said that *she left many personal belongings* one would take on a trip: luggage, makeup, cash, ID, credit cards, clothes.

Tracey was given a polygraph test in January 1990; the results were inconclusive. He was scheduled to take another test soon after, but he cancelled after having a “health crisis” at work; *he claimed this was a sudden bout of amnesia that made him forget the last 10 years of his life. Including his wife and daughter.*

Due to his supposed health problems, *he never did take the second polygraph test*. He has never been charged in connection with his wife’s case and there have been no arrests made, but Kerry’s family definitely suspects that Tracey murdered Kerry and disposed of her body. When police searched the house, they also searched *Tracey’s truck, which had dirt on it that is not consistent with the natural dirt in Burlington.*

Kerry only had one business trip for Gander Mountain and that had happened in 1987. Tracey told friends and family very often that “Kerry was traveling on business”. She would return home and be surprised at questions from friends and family regarding her recent business trips. *Kerry, in fact, rarely left Burlington besides going to work in Wilmot.*

The weekend before Kerry was last seen, her little sister went Christmas shopping with Kerry and Tracey. Tracey had a brand new pick up truck that “his friend Bob let him borrow”. **After Kerry’s disappearance, it was discovered that Tracey bought the truck himself and likely forged Kerry’s signature on the loan agreement. The couple was in debt at the time and Kerry’s family said there is no way she would agree to purchasing this vehicle; she was a very frugal woman.**

Racine County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Heather Spranger said that **the case moved away from Kerry voluntarily leaving after it was discovered that her husband replaced the bed in the master bedroom after his wife went missing**. “Investigators were never able to locate that bed,” Spranger said.

*Tracey’s excuse for this was that he wanted his wife to come home to a new waterbed. Her family says she had absolutely zero interest in a waterbed.*

In 1992, **Tracey Krueger’s brother told someone his brother killed his wife**. The person he confided in immediately notified law enforcement. When confronted with this information both at the time, and in a recent interview, Tracey Krueger’s brother said it was a “joke” and he had no knowledge of what happened on December 5, 1989.

Her daughter Megan firmly believes that her mother ran away and started a new life, pointing to diary entries of her mother’s that point to Kerry experiencing a “deep, dark depression”. It should be noted this diary was from Kerry’s adolescence. Megan also says that, when her mother was a journalist before acquiring her PR position with Gander Mountain, she had once written a piece regarding changing one’s identity. Megan says her father “loves and misses” her mother, somehow despite supposedly having amnesia that made him forget who Kerry was.

Kerry’s family is adamant she would not leave her daughter behind. Her bank accounts have not been touched and her social security number has never been used since her disappearance.

# What do you think happened to Kerry on that night during that freezing winter night? Let me know in the comments below.

Anyone with information regarding the disappearance of O’Brien-Krueger is asked to contact Investigator Heather Spranger at 262-636-3367. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous may contact Crime Stoppers of Racine County at 888-636-9330.

Ashanti Conde was last seen in Vancouver WA in 2018. 

She was last seen leaving a home with Michael Conley. Michael Conley was a rough character who a few years prior had attempted murder charges dropped due to some police misconduct:

https://www.columbian.com/news/2015/oct/12/vancouver-man-suspected-in-stabbing-appears-in-court/

https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/dec/16/men-released-in-attempted-murder-case/

It is not known why the two were together. Reports I've seen locally indicated that Ashanti unfortunately struggled with substance abuse and may have engaged in sex work.

Some time later after their disappearance Michael's car was found deep off a private road in very remote area North East of Vancouver, rendered inoperable. His remains were later found a few miles away and it's believed he died of exposure.

Questions always remained:

Why were they in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of winter? 

There's far closer and easier places to do things like drug deals, or other unscrupulous activities. The place they traveled was exceptionally remote. Why go all the way out there?

Did Michael bring Ashanti out there? 

With the remains found, it's certainly possible. But again why?

Did Ashanti face the same fate as Michael, or did she meet foul play either at Michaels hands or someone else's?

946,CherryBlossom724,[],1632971718,"Thelma Pauline Melton, known to her friends and family as ""Polly"", was born on February 26, 1923. Polly had been married to a man named Bob Melton, who was 78 at the time of Polly's disappearance, for six years. Bob had two grown sons from a previous marriage. This was Polly's third marriage, but she didn't have any children of her own. 

Polly and Bob lived in an Airstream trailer. Bob's health had been declining over the past few years, but they still loved to travel. Their primary residence was in Jacksonville, Florida, but for three months out of each year (during the fall) they would stay at the Deep Creek Campground, located next to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, in North Carolina. 

Polly loved hiking and would go with friends everyday, weather permitting. She never went hiking alone. They always stuck to the easy trails and Polly's personal favorite was the ""Deep Creek Trail"". 

On the day of Polly's disappearance she went hiking with two friends named Red and Trula. They set out on the Deep Creek Trail at about 3pm on September 25, 1981. To begin with Polly was walking at a slower pace than her friends, which they lightly teased her about. At about 4pm they started back for the campground and as they neared the location of Polly and Bob's trailer (there was also a parking lot nearby, which will become relevant later when we get into the theories), Polly suddenly started walking faster. At first, Red and Trula thought her faster pace was in response to the earlier teasing, but Polly walked faster and faster, outpacing them, eventually reaching one of the hills and then disappearing from view. Red and Trula reached Polly's trailer at about 4:30pm and found Bob right where they left him, alone. Bob hadn't seen Polly since she left and had no idea where she might be.

They, along with Red's husband and another friend of Polly's, set off back down the trail, searching the area for Polly, asking hikers along the way if they had seen her, but no one had. No sign of her was found. After two hours of searching, they notified the park rangers that Polly was missing, who in turn contacted the police. Police officers attempted to follow Polly's tracks, since the sole of one of her shoes was distinctive (it had a crack across the ball of the foot). They were able to track her for a while but her footprints eventually became obscured by the tracks of others. From what they could tell, however, it didn't appear that she had wandered off the trail.

The trail was shut down to the public the day that Polly went missing and over 150 people and 9 search dogs aided in the search. The search dogs picked up her scent on a tree that had fallen in the woods but nowhere else. The authorities didn't find this significant though and assumed that she had probably rested there at some point and had maybe taken a smoke break. The search turned up nothing else.

Four days later the trail was reopened to the public and the search officially ended on October 2nd. 

More details about Polly:

* She suffered from high blood pressure and frequent bouts of nausea, both of which she took medication for.

* Due to medical issues, Polly wasn't permitted to drive alone and so Bob did all of the driving.

* Polly was said to be an extremely private person.

* She volunteered at the Presbyterian Nutritional Center and had been doing so for four years, during the months they were staying in Deep Creek Campground each year. Oddly, the day she went missing she chose not to volunteer there. This is notable because the day she went missing was a Friday and she always worked there on Fridays. The routine at the Center was to write down if you would coming in to work the next day and on the 24th, Polly did not indicate that she would be coming in the following day. So she knew ahead of time that she wouldn't be working there on Friday.

* Her supervisor said that she had never used the Center's phone in four years of volunteering there, that is until the day before she went missing in which she used the phone several times. No one knows who she spoke to and they were unable to trace the calls.

* Her minister said that she had alluded to having an affair with another man and that she felt very guilty about it. He also stated that she was starting to come out of a depression that she had been in for years following her mother's death and that she seemed to be doing much better. No one else in her life knew anything about this mystery man that she was allegedly having an affair with and no one was ever able to find out anything about him or who he was.

Theories:

* She ran away with her mystery man to start a new life. Was she walking slowly to begin with on that last hike because she was pacing herself, knowing that she would need to get far ahead of her friends at the end of the hike? There was a parking lot near the area where she was last seen. Was her lover waiting there to pick her up? The strange phone calls the day before and the fact that she uncharacteristically chose not to work at the Center that day seem to lend credence to this theory. However, she left behind her blood pressure and nausea medications, as well as her ID, and her bank account was never touched again. 

* Kidnapping. Some have theorized that she might have been snatched from the trail by kidnappers, although her friends didn't hear anything and there were no signs of a struggle anywhere in the area. 

* Suicide. Her mother's death in 1978 devastated her and she suffered from depression afterwards. She had been taking Valium for a while, but by 1981 she was no longer being prescribed it. However, Bob had a prescription for Valium and his bottle mysteriously went missing the same day that Polly did. It's unknown how many pills were left in it though and from what I've read, it's pretty hard to fatally overdose on Valium by itself. 

Six months after Polly's disappearance, something odd happened.  A check in Polly's name was cashed in Birmingham, Alabama, about 300 miles southwest of where she vanished. The check was for interest due on a bank certificate. It's unclear how long after this authorities looked into it, but when they did they found that the signature on the check appeared to be Polly's. Unfortunately, the teller had no recollection of what the person who cashed the check looked like or anything else about them. Polly's only known bank account in her name was in Jacksonville, Florida, and that account hadn't been touched since her disappearance. However, Polly was born in Alabama and still had family there at the time.

I find this case really intriguing. What are your thoughts on what happened to Polly?

947,336mpo36,[],1632970415,"  

Boone isn’t necessarily what most people picture when they think of the state of North Carolina. A small town tucked away in the mountains near the Tennessee border, Boone has a climate much more similar to southern New England the southeast. Sitting at 3,333 feet, Boone has the highest elevation of any municipality with a population over 10,000 east of the Mississippi River. Every year, the town receives an average of 33 inches of snowfall, much more in line with Hartford, CT (27 inches) than Raleigh, NC’s capitol (3.7 inches). The city is best known for Appalachian State University, a large public university that draws young men and women from all over the state and region to Boone. ASU is certainly the largest single entity in the region. Boone’s population hovers around 19,000. ASU’s total enrollment is about 21,000. Boone is the definition of a college town, although it doesn’t necessarily fit the standard college town mold.

In such a small town, serious crimes are rare. Boone and ASU Police police both publish their crime logs online. They’re mainly filled with minor issues: noise complaints, shoplifters, vandalism, and the myriad of alcohol issues that come with having a huge college in town. The most serious crimes in Boone are usually related to methamphetamine, which is often produced and consumed in the mountains of Watauga County, outside the town limits. Today we’ll be digging into a rare unsolved Boone mystery, made even more rare by the fact that it involves a disappearance.

James Martin Roberts (who went by his middle name, Martin) grew up in Kernersville, North Carolina, about two hours south of Boone. Kernersville is a fairly small town located between several large cities in the Piedmont Triad area, very different from the Blue Ridge mountains of Boone. Martin grew up enjoying the outdoors and athletics. As he got into high school, he set his sights on a business degree, and his dream school was Appalachian State. Ever since visiting Boone, he fell in love with the mountainous region. This love for the area was exemplified by a tattoo he later got on his left arm, depicting three mountains. In 2014, he graduated High School, and in the fall of the same year, he moved into an on-campus dorm at ASU. He quickly got involved with Greek life and pledged an ASU fraternity. Unfortunately, Martin seemed to fall into the trap that many new college students do: taking advantage of the newfound freedom of college and letting his grades suffer. By the end of the semester, his grades were poor enough that he was in danger of being suspended.

Martin went home for the summer, but soon returned to Appalachian for his second year. He would need to work hard to avoid being removed from classes for his poor grades, but unfortunately, partying and poor decision-making conspired once again to ruin his second semester at Appalachian. His first night back on campus, he went to a party with some of his fraternity brothers and drank fairly extensively. He then made the decision to drive back to his dorm. As he turned onto the ASU campus, he pulled right in front of an Appalachian Campus Police car, cutting the officer off. Martin was pulled over and eventually arrested for DWI. While at the jail, Martin used his phone call to contact his girlfriend to come bail him out. She lived all the way back in Kernersville, but still drove to Boone to get him out of jail. When she arrived, he had already been released on his own recognizance. His girlfriend was angry that she had driven to Boone for essentially no reason due to Martin’s own mistakes, which quickly escalated to an argument, which escalated to her breaking up with Martin and driving back home. Martin had lost his license and been dumped all in one night. On top of that, since he was arrested by the university police, he likely knew that his DWI charge would find its way to the student conduct office, and his already-perilous position at App would now be hopeless.

Shortly thereafter, Martin called his parents and said he wanted to go home. He told them he’d been arrested and expressed disappointment with himself but lied and stated that he had been arrested for public intoxication rather than DWI. He ended up taking a full semester off from App and worked full time at a local business. He then returned to Boone for the spring 2016 semester.

His next semester at Appalachian seemed to be going swimmingly. Martin called his father frequently and explained how he had gotten a couple part-time jobs locally, and was working long hours, making good money, and doing very well in school. He had moved into an off-campus apartment with a couple friends and was staying away from the partying and drinking scene to avoid another run-in with the police. All seemed great. That is, until April of 2016, when Martin abruptly stopped calling his father, despite having said that he would do so. Martin’s father, John, was worried, but at first thought his son must be busy with all his jobs and schoolwork. After not hearing from him for several days, John contacted the manager of the apartments Martin lived in. The manager went by and knocked on the door, but Martin wasn’t there. The manager then talked to the other residents of the apartment, who checked Martin’s room. He wasn’t there, but they did find a note he had left behind. The contents of the note haven’t been made public at the request of the family, but the police aren’t necessarily classifying it as a suicide note. The note expressed that Martin was disappointed with himself, that he had been living a lie, and that he wanted to get away from everything.

This is when it was revealed that Martin had been lying about much of his life to those around him. He wasn’t enrolled at App. He had been taking online courses at Caldwell Community College to get his grades back up, but he abruptly stopped participating a month before he disappeared. He had applied for jobs at all the various places he’d said he was working, but he had never been hired anywhere. He had often told his friends conflicting information about where he’d been going and who he’d been hanging out with.

The last confirmed sighting of Martin was on April 22nd. He had told his friends that he was going to campus to study in the library. Prior to going, he got a friend to drive him around town so he could get a haircut, purchase groceries, and take cash out of the bank. Curiously, the cash and groceries were not in his apartment when police investigated later. At 12:30, he ran into his cousin while they were both walking on campus near the intersection of Rivers St and Hill St near the App State Convocation Center. They talked briefly, then his cousin boarded an AppalCART bus that departed from the area. Martin could be seen on camera footage from the bus walking away on foot but wasn’t located on camera after that. He was wearing a black short sleeve Appalachian windbreaker, khaki shorts, gray New Balance sneakers, and a backpack. The contents of the backpack are unknown. It is known that Martin left his phone, laptop, and wallet at home. His state ID was not located there, meaning that he possibly took it with him.

Locals reported possibly sighting Martin near Trout Lake recreation area, near the town of Blowing Rock, about one and a half hours later. Martin would possibly have been familiar with the area since it was popular with App State students. The North Carolina State Highway Patrol used an infrared-equipped helicopter to search the same night these sightings were reported but didn’t find anything. As the days went on, police swarmed the area with helicopters, dogs, and search parties, but had no luck finding anything. On top of local Boone police and Watauga sheriff deputies, campus police officers from App and the other 16 University of North Carolina schools flooded into the region to assist. All were unsuccessful.  

Boone and App State police have continued to work this case since the disappearance. There has been no activity on any of Martin’s bank accounts, he hasn’t contacted anyone, and every reported sighting hasn’t panned out. The Boone police chief even put out a poster containing his direct office phone, informing anyone with information that they could call him directly and anonymously. No calls came in. A $10,000 reward has also so far provided no new information.

Theories abound about what could have happened to Martin. Perhaps he walked off into the woods and committed suicide because he was so disappointed in himself due to the way his life had gotten off track and all the lies he had to tell his loved ones. This unfortunately (to me at least) seems to be the most likely possibility, although repeated searches of the area with search parties and cadaver dogs have been unsuccessful. Of course, it is possible (although fairly unlikely) that Martin decided to walk off and start a new life somewhere. There’s also the “Into the Wild” scenario, where Martin decided to take some time in the woods to clear his head. Perhaps he packed the groceries and headed out to Trout Lake to get away from it all. He wasn’t an experienced outdoorsman, and he didn’t know the woods well. Maybe he wandered off and got lost, then eventually died of exposure, starvation, or thirst. As a variant of that, maybe in his wanderings he ran into something he shouldn’t have seen, like the previously-referenced meth operations in the mountains. The only thing the police have said for certain is that Martin walked away from campus of his own accord. 

I'd love to hear theories here. Do you all think it's one of the above-listed options, or something else entirely?

948,TheVault_FCC,[],1632938004,"(Grand Forks, North Dakota) When Mike Nikle didn't hear from his daughter the night of Oct. 3, 1996, he knew immediately that something was wrong. Nineteen year old Kristi Nikle was well-known and well-liked in town, but police would consider her a high-risk victim due to her trusting personality. 

According to her brother Lonnie, she would do just about anything that you asked of her or told her to do. Kristi was also born with a developmental disability, which her family said caused her to have the mental abilities of a 10-year-old.  

The last time anyone heard or saw of Kristi was when she went to bingo with a friend. The family was advised to wait 72 hours before filing a missing persons report because Kristi was an adult. 

For years, there were no suspects or leads. There was one suspect, but the police haven't questioned him further in years. 

Kristi's family is still hoping that she is out there somewhere.

949,mrsj74,[],1632936240,"This is a follow up to a post I submitted four years ago. I have been contacted by a member of Bobby's extended family who would like to update in the comments. Unfortunately, there has been no resolution to his disappearance, but a local news story covered his case today and hopefully, someone might come forward.

Bobby Eugene Adams was working the graveyard shift driving a cab for C&amp;H Taxi Services when he picked up what would be his last fare. It was November 30th, 1991 and Bobby was driving his cab during the graveyard shift. (Typically 12 a.m. - 8 a.m.) He would pick up a Caucasian man described as being in his forties and having blonde hair. Bobby would never be seen again.

Bobby drove his cab around the Charleston, West Virginia area and was last seen near MacCorkle Street. His cab was found the next day on Twilight Drive. When the cab was found, it was obvious to investigators that something horrific and violent had happened to Bobby. The cab was covered in Bobby's blood to the point that police felt it would be difficult for a person to survive having lost so much blood. There would be nothing else found to indicate what happened, where Bobby was, or who the man was riding in the back of the cab.

Thirty years have gone by and police are hopeful they will get answers. Over the years, there have been some suspects and many rumors. Rumors as to where Bobby's remains are and who may have been in that cab have been investigated, but led nowhere. There is one development though that may lead to a break in the case, the progression of DNA technology. That may truly be the key that unlocks this case and brings forth justice. C &amp; H Taxi also made some changes in the period after Bobby's disappearance. They updated their technology including installing cameras inside their cabs as well as in the office.

Bobby was 31 years old and African American. He was 5'0 and 110 pounds. He had black hair and brown eyes, but was known to shave his head. He may have also had a mustache. Sadly, I didn't find any mention of his family so I can't give a lot of background unfortunately. Edit: As stated, a member of Bobby's family has contacted me. The new link also states there were Christmas presents for Bobby's children found in the taxi. He is sorely missed and has family who still don't know what happened or where Bobby is.  

So in looking at this case, I think it's very likely that Bobby is deceased, but I hope this brings renewed attention to him. I also have some thoughts I want to toss out and I would like to hear what you all think. If the man he picked up killed Bobby, why take the body and how far could he take it? It would appear that he didn't try to clean up the cab, so why not just leave Bobby there? I can't see him burying a body unless he got into the cab with a shovel and I can't see that being likely. If this were a robbery that got out of hand, again why not leave Bobby there? Was this planned? Did someone follow the cab, say an accomplice of the man in the taxi? I just can't make any sense of this. What do you think? Edit: These are the same discussion points I submitted four years ago. My thoughts remain much the same.

In May 1979, Mr Podpinka married his wife, who was pregnant with their child. On 20 January 1983, they emigrated to Perth and with the help of the Polish community, settled into Perth.

In December 1986, Mr Podpinka became an Australian Citizen and his wife achieved the same status in March 1987.

CASE DETAILS:

I find the case quite bizarre. Andrew was apparently impaired physically and perhaps mentally and as such I have no idea why anyone would want to target him. Doesn't seem that a robbery was the primary motive and the murder was just a unfortunate result of that - Morley isn't exactly an affluent area in Perth and this is even more true back in 1999. 

How is it that someone knew he would be alone for that singular hour while his wife and children were out shopping? Was it a random act of violence? Did Andrew have some shady side or background whereby someone was out to get him? 

I'm struggling to find a motive. Perhaps he was enrolled in an institution whereby he was acquainted with other impaired individuals who mightve had some mental disorder in which resulted in the outcome?

951,taterkatie,[],1632879190,"Allyson Rieg was an alcoholic - more like a binge drinker. She would go through long periods of sobriety, relapse and drink for a week, then return to recovery. In March of 2018 she left Victorville, CA, where she was living with her father, and moved into a sober living in San Diego. She stayed there until May, then rented a room in La Mesa. Things seemed to be going well, but she started drinking in the middle of May. She reached out to Robert Hendry, a former resident of the sober living. Robert seemed to be a responsible young man. He said that he had worked for the F.B.I., had been a part of the Drug Task Force Unit for the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and was now a managing partner in a law firm. By June 1st they decided to move into a downtown condo that was rented by his father. It was thought that she wasn't drinking, because she was talking to friends and family (which didn't happen when she drank). However, on June 15th those closest to her began to suspect that she had begun to drink again. 

Her family left on a trip on June 16th, and returned on June 23rd. When they returned from the trip, they were unable to get ahold of Allyson. When they hadn't heard from her by the evening of Friday, June 29th, they asked Allyson’s brother to call Robert. The family was worried because they could track Allyson's location on 'Find My Friends', and she had not left the condo in over a week. Her brother was able to talk to Robert, who said that Allyson had been drinking, but had stopped, that there was no alcohol in the house, and by 10 a.m. the next day she would be sober for 14 hours. Allyson’s brother told Robert she would need to go to the hospital, and to call him if she gave him any problems.
 
On June 30, 2018, at 1:07 p.m., ‘Find My Friends’ alerted the family that Allyson had left the condo. It looked like she went to a Mexican restaurant, then a store, and then back to the condo. At about 2:30 p.m., the family missed a call from Allyson’s friend. They called her back around 3:15 p.m., where she told me that Robert had called her and told her that Allyson was deceased (his words). Allyson’s brother then called 911 for a welfare check. By 4:30 p.m. it was confirmed that she had died. According to the Medical Examiner's Report, her BAC was very high, and she also had Xanax in her system. Evidently, there was an empty prescription bottle for Robert at the scene.
 
Robert told police investigators he strangled Allyson on June 29th between 9 and 10 p.m. This is within range of the time of estimated death. The M.E. report indicates there was no sign of strangulation. Although the pathologist states there does not have to be signs of strangulation, this would be very rare. The M.E. report states Allyson had .09mg of alprazolam and an extremely high level of alcohol in her system, .42%. The alprazolam level in itself without other factors would not kill anyone.  The alcohol level likely would kill most people. Basically, your body stops breathing and then your heart stops. Because Allyson's body has become accustomed to heavy alcohol levels, she could survive a .42% alcohol level in her blood. 

Robert tells a bar tender he killed his wife and he also tells law enforcement he strangled Allyson. There were no signs of strangulation to Allyson's neck. Breathing stops and then the heart stops when one dies of alcohol intoxication. So, there is a period when the breathing slows and becomes shallow. Some may pull through, others may not. But this would be a period when someone could potentially smother a person to death, which does not leave injuries other than say petechiae that is usually in the eyes and sometimes on ones face. The pathologist did not note petechiae present and he would have looked for it as routine. Petechiae is caused by your body working hard to take a breath, but can't. In Allyson's state of extreme intoxication, combined with a normal dose of alprazolam, her body could have been so sedated that her body would not have fought to take a breath. Simply a hand over her mouth and nose could have killed her and she would not have struggled.

In 2019, Robert went onto Dr. Phil and reiterated many times that he was the one that killed Allyson and that, “I think wealthy people can get away with anything”. Dr. Phil claimed that Robert was lying and was simply seeking attention.

The report is a very strange account, and the manner of death was just recently changed from ""Accidental"" to ""Undetermined"".

Was Allyson’s death a suicide, murder, or simply an accident?

952,jwarne1,[],1632874511,"So, let’s make “Officer 277” from Dallas PD famous.

I was leaving my appointment at North Texas Infectious Disease consultants, the Dallas contractor for Pfizer, getting my third shot/booster vaccine as a study volunteer, when I noticed the Fire Department was outside when I came down to wait for my Lyft home. There was a woman face down who looked dead. I started filming.

I was thereafter attacked by a cop who told me to “stop filming” three times. I said, “I have every right to film.” And he said, “This is private property!” He started chasing me down the drive, so I started filming him demanding that he tell me again what he told me before I started filming, to “stop filming.” He refused, instead, just repeating “This is private property” and threatening to arrest me.

So, I just sent the attached videos to Dallas PD, Dave Lieber (‘The Watchdog’) of The Dallas Morning News, and NTIDC. The incredibly stupid thing is that I went to the side walk and started filming again from a better vantage point. I’ve requested public information pertaining to the call to try to identify the woman so she has copies of the video, Dallas PD trying to prevent me from filming, etc.

BTW, while my phone is pointed at the ground and I am walking, I am walking backward facing him. You can’t really hear it, but he’s saying to me that he could have arrested me for interfering with a police investigation. I was walking backward, calling him an “asshole,” “sick,” and “unconstitutional motherfucker.” It looks like I was mumbling as I walked away, I was telling him that to his face. Once I hit the sidewalk I was willing to get arrested.

Last video was a mistake. Accidentally took my finger off the record button. So, even though he pushed me onto the sidewalk, it was a semi-circle hospital drop off. I just walked to the other side and had a better vantage of them putting her in the ambulance still looking very much dead. But, like I said, accidentally took my finger off the record button.

953,moondog151,[],1632853204,"(I covered this case before but it was mostly ignored and also back when I was just starting write up's so this is another one i've redone and also made slightly more easy to read)

María Milagros Cuarezma Castellón was born on December 18, 1943 her mother was named Juana Castellón while her father's name appears to be unknown. The family was plaqued by long before this case as in February, 1949 her younger brother Socorro Cuarezma was crushed to death after being run over by a truck at only 5 years old and the year prior in 1948 Juancito Cuarezma, Milagros's other little brother died of a fever when he was only 2.

On August 1, 1949 at exactly 6:00 AM her mother sent her to the store about 100 meters from her home to go buy some milk at a grocery store owned by a woman named María Antonia Meza near Trébol theater in Managua the capital of Nicaragua, Milagros was last seen wearing a red robe. That was the last time that 6 year old Milagros was seen alive.

On August 7 a child named Camilito González was paying on the shores of Lake Managua when he discovered pigs and dogs fighting over a group of bones on the ground and called the police. They arrived and determined that the bones belonged to a child. The police found a red bathrobe, a tin jar, a white handkerchief with the initials AL, and several loose sheets of paper belonging to a railway guide. Juana the mother identified the body as her daughter stating that the red robe was the same one Milagros was wearing.

With Milagros's death a nine month old baby named Gilberto was the only surviving child of Juana and the unnamed father. 500 people showed up to the funeral. At the service the grandmother Isaura Castellón publicly claimed that the murderer was a woman named Olga Vega López whom Milagros's family had been having trouble with before this incident including one incident when Olga accused Isaura of stealing a bar of soap and claimed that Olga said ""You will regret this for the rest of your life""

Based on this alone the police issued a warrant for Olga's arrest and when they arrived at her home she was not present. Instead they were greeted by two brothers named Francisco and Octavio Zúñiga who lived with Olga and helped her pay the rent. They denied knowing anything about Milagros and stated that Olga left for Diriamba rather urgently. The police arrested the two brothers anyway before releasing them due to a lack of evidence and soon later Olga turned herself in.

Then 8 year old Rodolfo López Varela going by the alias Chumequita came forward as a witness stating that he saw Olga talking with Milagros the day of the murder and held her hand and took her to her ""house"" he then followed Olga and watched through a crack in the door. He claimed that he witnessed Olga with the help of a neighbor called Estebana Munguía kill and dismember Olga with a knife.

Following this testimony the police went to that location and found a knife with dried blood on it, a dress, photograph with red stains on it likely blood and a jar containing human hair. Police then arrested Estebana soon after who then confessed to the crime stating that they dismembered Milagros peeled the skin from her bones and bleached them before disposing of her remains near lake Managua.

The case was ended up shocking the entire country and was front page news in The Nicaraguan Press with several newspapers listing it as a ""satanic crime"" for the sake of sensationalism. It got to the point where then president of Nicaragua Víctor Manuel Román commented by the case calling for a thorough investigation and demanding the most severe possible punishment for the killers which at the time would've been the death penalty. Capus Waynick the US ambassador to Nicaragua even offered up the FBI's assistance and to have an American pathologist examine the body if asked however this offer was declined.

Chumequita's family ended up receiving several letters and reporters showed up to their door in droves to interview the boy. In response his family sent him to live with his father in Managua even this ended up becoming a huge news story as several reporters searched as hard as they could to find him claiming that he disappeared and that they were trying to ""rescue"" him until they learned that he had indeed been sent to live with his father.

The news also put forward several claims of their own as if they were facts such as stating that Milagros's was cannibalized by Olga and Estebana. Rage filled the city of Managua and a mob formed with the intent to torch Olga's home and lynch the two alleged killers and in response the police called for the assistance of the Nicaraguan army who violently put down the mob. The army would remain stationed in Managua to prevent further incidents.

The entire country was split in two by this case with those condemning Olga and Estebana and calling for their deaths and others believing them to be innocent due to most of the evidence being circumstantial and the only witness being an 8 year old child with little evidence backing his claims.

These tensions ended up resulting more violence with one notable incident being a brawl at a bar which started when two man named José Jacinto Pérez and Clemente Estrada got into an argument over weather Olga was guilty or not this fight then escalated when the two brandished a knife and both attacked each other with their weapons which the whole spiraled into the whole bar joining in on until the army swiftly and brutally put an end to it and hauled Pérez and Estrada to jail.

After months of tensions and a heavy military presence in the city the trial finally started which The Nicaraguan Press made sure to closely monitor.

Reporters swarmed the inside and outside of the courtroom and those inside would speak over the prosecutors, defense attorneys and the judge to ask Olga and Estebana their own questions and would either applaud or boo their answers. And of course the reporters were also speaking over other reporters and it got to a point where Olga stood up screamed for the entire court to ""Shut up"" to which they obliged.

It was alleged by the defense that the police extracted a confession from Estebana via coercing and maybe even violence something which the Nicaraguan police employed a lot during that time and even today and often back then this was simply enough and the judge would take the police's word that the confession was willing. The entire case was based on the confession of Estebana whom was considered by many to be insane/mentally ill and Chumequita's testimony and during the trial Chumequita's reliability was being called into question as it was found out during the trial he would tell anyone details about what he witnessed as long as he was payed some Nicaraguan córdoba or a glass of Chicha and he would keep giving different accounts of the event to different people.

In one incident Chumequita had to be taken to the hospital as all the Chicha he was drinking caused vomiting and congestion. The media however reported this as a story about someone trying to poison Chumequita in order to silence him. In one incident Chumequita was detained after he was found with letters containing death threats (not directed towards him) once news of his arrest became public another mob formed with the intent to free him. This one was also put down violently. But needlessly to say the reliability of the prosecution's only witness was in serious question.

The prosecutors then sought other witnesses with none of them being reliable one of them being a Medium claiming to have been sent a message by Milagros from beyond the grave, a thief who in an effort to avoid jail time said that he saw her body being disposed off but offered different accounts every time he was asked, a servant who suffered from severe mental illness and a woman named Emma Luna de Thompson who was a wanted fugitive in Guatemala and was currently fighting with her lawyer to get a Nicaraguan immigration permit so she wouldn't be deported back to Guatemala. Needless to say the prosecution's case was falling apart fast.

To make matters worse their psychical evidence was now being called into question as test came back showing that what was believed to be dried blood found on the knife in Olga's room was actually just rust and and that the blood on the dress and photograph was actually red aniline or stains and that the hair found in a jar belonged to a adult not a child.

However things for the defense were proving difficult as well. Olga and Estebana's first defense lawyer Carlos Hernández Salinas was dismissed as he was found to be paying off desperate drunks to give false testimony exonerating Olga and Estebana, purposely delaying the trial in one case threatening the judge and prosecutor with a gun. And even before any of this he was receiving several death threats just for being Olga and Estebana's defense lawyer and one person even mailed a box to his office and when opened three poisonous snakes jumped out and almost bit him.

The body was also exhumed and kept in a wooden box which was moved back and forth during the trial where it was found that several bones were missing with these bones including a shoulder blade, a pharynx of the left foot, both hands, the right foot and several ribs. Getting desperate a crowd of citizens who believed in Olga's guilt upon hearing this went over to Olga's home to search for the bones and during this search they removed bricks from the foundation, tore up the floor boards, tore down the walls of the home, tore off the roof tiles and even dug up the ground around the home. One of Milagros's relative also got out a WW2 gas mask on loan from the Nicaraguan red cross and tied a rope to himself and descended down Olga's latrine to look for the missing bones and failed to find anything and almost died while leaving the latrine as his rope almost snapped which would of lead to him drowning in urine and feces. All this was in an effort to find the rest of Milagros's remains and prove Olga's guilt however they found nothing.

Olga's entire house being destroyed with not a single bone being found did not help the prosecution's case. And it only got worse as on January 27, 1950 Chumequita was forced by his father to tell the truth and he confessed that he lied and never witnessed Olga and Estebana killing Milagros.

To make matters worse it was discovered that no autopsy was actually Preformed on Milagros to determine weather the body actually belonged to her or not and as a result of this blunder the cause of death was never officially determined. The final straw came when the police were unable to present the body for an actual autopsy to be conducted. It seems the bones just disappeared and the police simply lost them.

After extensive trials and the lack of any real evidence presented by the police on March 17, 1950 Olga and Estebana were found not guilty but the judge ordered them sent to a mental institution regardless. They were both deemed insane but in the few lucid moments they had Olga and Estebana admitted that their confession had been false. On September 21, 1950 Olga was released and her activities upon leaving the mental institution are unknown but she would die sometime in the late 1990s while Chumequita the boy who's false testimony was the prosecution's best evidence as of August 9, 2000 is still alive. What became of Estebana is unknown.

To date this is one of the most infamous unsolved murders in Nicaraguan history and leaves many unanswered questions but the main ones are weather or not Olga and Estebana were actually guilty or not and weather those bones truly belonged to Milagros or another unfortunate child who was never identified and if they aren't her remains when what happened María Milagros Cuarezma Castellón and who did these remains actually belong to? It is likely that none of these questions will ever be answered.

954,milehighmystery,[],1632845264,"Lana Patricia Derrick was born in 1976 and grew up outside of Terrace, British Columbia, Canada. She was a member of the Gitanyow First Nation. From a young age, Lana excelled in school and always loved nature. She aspired to go to college and pursue a career where she could utilize her love of logging and being outdoors. 

After her nineteenth birthday in 1995, Lana enrolled in the forestry program at Northwest Community College and began studying at the campus in Houston, BC. The campus was a three-hour drive from her parents’ home in Terrace, but Lana regularly went home over the weekends to visit her family and friends, usually relying on rides from friends in both towns. In October 1995, Lana made plans to travel back to Terrace for Canadian Thanksgiving.

**The Disappearance** 

On Friday, October 6, 1995, Lana caught a ride with a friend from campus and left Houston around noon. The two arrived at the home of her parents, Darvin and Marge Haugan that afternoon. Lana knew her parents had to work over the weekend before a family Thanksgiving get-together on Sunday evening, so she planned on staying with friends in downtown Terrace until Sunday. When Lana arrived at her parent’s empty home on Friday afternoon, she set her backpack full of her school books on the bed in her bedroom and left with her friend.

The exact timeline of Lana’s whereabouts on the evening of October 6 varies by source. Sometime after Lana and her friend left the Haugan’s home that afternoon, they drove into downtown Terrace to meet up with some other friends at a house party. Downtown Terrace is on the west side of the Skeena River, with Highway 16 serving as the main interstate in the area. Lana was seen downtown at a nightclub called *Gigi’s Pub* and was later at *Tim Horton’s*. 

Later that evening, Lana was walking downtown and ran into her stepsister, Clarice. (In different newspaper articles, Clarice is referred to as Lana’s friend) Clarice told Lana that her father had given her some money for Lana and that she could pick up the $30 she had for her later that night. The two made a plan for Clarice to take the money to her apartment in downtown Terrace, where Lana would pick it up later. After conversing for another half hour or so, Lana and Clarice said goodbye and parted ways. 

At about 3:00 a.m. on Saturday, October 7, Clarice woke up to somebody repeatedly knocking on her front door. Half asleep, Clarice opened the door to find Lana, who appeared intoxicated but in a good mood. Clarice invited Lana inside and Lana asked for the $30 that her father had left for her. Clarice gave her the money and the two continued chatting for a few minutes. Lana invited Clarice to join her at another house party, but Clarice ultimately declined. Around 3:30 a.m., Lana said goodbye to her stepsister and walked out of the apartment. Clarice watched as Lana continued walking on Lakelse Avenue, heading southbound towards Highway 16. This was the last confirmed sighting of Lana Derrick. 

**Searches &amp; Investigation**

When Marge and Darvin Haugan noticed their daughters’ belongings in her room, they didn’t think much of it, since it was not uncommon for Lana to stay with friends while she was in town. They had both been busy working on Friday and Saturday and had barely been home. However, Marge was immediately surprised when she noticed Lana’s bag on her bed, including her schoolbooks. It seemed strange that she would leave her bag instead of taking it with her if she intended on staying with friends. Although bothered by this, Marge shrugged it off and continued working through the weekend. When Sunday passed with no word from Lana, her parents began to contact friends and family members asking if anybody had seen her.  Marge and Darvin realized very quickly that nobody had seen Lana since she left Clarice’s apartment early on Saturday morning. 

On Tuesday, October 10, Lana didn’t show up to her classes at Northwest Community College, confirming her parent’s fears. There was no sign of her on campus or in Houston. It was very unlike Lana to miss her classes, and her classmates reported being confused by her absence after the holiday. The textbooks were still sitting on her bed in the same spot she had left them the previous Friday. After four days and no word from their daughter, Darvin and Marge contacted The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Terrace to report their daughter missing. At first, the RCMP dismissed their worries, suggesting that Lana was out partying or staying with “some boyfriend”. 

Unfortunately, Lana was not the first woman from a small First Nation to vanish from Highway 16 in British Columbia.  Between 1994 and 1995 alone, at least five other native women had disappeared on or near Highway 16, which runs southbound of the locations Lana was seen before she disappeared. By 1995, Highway 16 was already known as “the Highway of Tears”, because of disappearances in northern BC that dated back to the 1970s. Because of regular disregard from the RCMP, most municipalities established their own search effort procedures for when indigenous women went missing. Once word of Lana’s disappearance spread in the community, volunteers from the Gitwinksihlkw search and rescue group assembled and began an expansive search throughout Terrace, focusing on downtown and Lakelse Avenue. A group of 25 volunteers walked along Highway 16 in an effort to find any clues, officially starting the search for Lana.

Two weeks after Lana was last seen, the RCMP agreed to look into her disappearance and Marge Haugan was finally able to file a missing person report. The RCMP aided the Gitwinksihlkw search and rescue group for the first week, searching along Highway 16 for any evidence. By the end of October, the RCMP had called off the search for Lana.

**Witness Sightings**

In December 1995, a witness contacted the RCMP with information about a possible sighting of Lana on the morning of her disappearance. 

During a forensic hypnosis session directed by a psychologist from the Vancouver RCMP, the witness recalled seeing a woman matching Lana Derrick’s description in Thornhill, the small town located on the east side of the Skeena River. The sighting occurred at the Copperside Foods/Petro-Canada service store along Highway 16, about two miles east of Clarice’s apartment in Terrace. 

Sometime between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m. on Saturday, October 7, the witness was parked in an adjacent parking lot near the store, when an older, late 1980’s model vehicle pulled into the Copperside Foods parking lot. The witness watched as a young woman presumed to be Lana got out of the blue/grey, four-door sedan and enter the convenience store. The car was loud and in rough shape, with peeling paint and a large, horizontal scrape beneath the driver’s door. The brake light was out on the driver’s side and there was a small decal in the window. Two white balls hung from the rear-view mirror. 

The witness watched Lana leave the store with a pack of cigarettes and get into the backseat of the car. The witness described the driver of the car as a well-built, heavyset native man in his 30’s, with black, shoulder-length hair. He was wearing a biker-style jacket. The person in the passenger seat was described as a native or part-native man in his 30’s with long, messy brown hair, a mustache, tall and skinny with “long arms”, wearing a dirty T-shirt and jeans. The witness described both men as “grungy-looking”. 

After Lana got in the backseat, the car loudly pulled out of the parking lot and turned right on Frontage Road. The witness said the car continued driving east towards the Northern Motor Inn.  

The RCMP released a composite sketch of the men described by the witness in early 1996, asking the public for help in identifying them. Lana’s parents were grateful the police were conducting a formal investigation but doubted the validity of the tip. The security video footage of Copperside Foods from October 7 had already been recorded over by the time the witness contacted the police. 

**Theories**

When the composite sketch was released to the public in 1996, there were over 250 tips submitted regarding Lana’s whereabouts. By 1997, the RCMP had narrowed this down to 30 active tips. The men seen by the witness were never identified from the composite sketch. Yet one of the most promising leads at the time came from Clarice, the last known person to see Lana. 

Clarice told the RCMP about a man she had briefly dated in 1994. She broke things off with him after an incident when he became violent with her while he was intoxicated, resulting in some minor injuries. Because the man was in the same friend group as Clarice and Lana, he knew both women and regularly hung out with mutual friends. Sometime in 1995, against Clarice’s approval and warnings, Lana became romantically involved with the man and the two were casually seeing each other at the time of her disappearance. 

On Sunday, October 8, 1995, the morning after Lana was last seen, Clarice received a call from a friend. Clarice learned that her ex-boyfriend, the man currently seeing Lana, had committed suicide the night before on October 7.

The RCMP investigated the suicide but was not able to find any connection to Lana’s disappearance. His name was never released to the media. 

In an interview with the *CBC*, Lana’s aunt, Sally Gibson described her niece as a strong, “tough girl”, who more than likely would have fought an attacker. Sally also explained why the family did not believe one person could have harmed Lana:

&amp;amp;gt;”She was tough, you know, and that's what hurts her dad so bad because if something happened to her, it took more than one”

_

Lana’s disappearance is part of an RCMP task force called E-PANA, which investigates unsolved murders and disappearances with links to the Highway of Tears. She has been missing for almost 26 years and her case remains open. She was five-foot-seven and weighed 150 lbs at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen wearing black jeans, a green sweatshirt, and running shoes. She had shoulder-length black hair, brown eyes, and wore eyeglasses.

In an interview with the *CBC*, Lana’s aunt, Sally Gibson described her niece as a strong, “tough girl”, who more than likely would have fought an attacker. Sally also explained why the family did not believe one person could have harmed Lana:

&gt;”She was tough, you know, and that's what hurts her dad so bad because if something happened to her, it took more than one”

_

Lana’s disappearance is part of an RCMP task force called E-PANA, which investigates unsolved murders and disappearances with links to the Highway of Tears. She has been missing for almost 26 years and her case remains open. She was five-foot-seven and weighed 150 lbs at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen wearing black jeans, a green sweatshirt, and running shoes. She had shoulder-length black hair, brown eyes, and wore eyeglasses.

956,kochampiwerko,[],1632837556,"I have a weird one from Poland, the story got some traction in the last few days due to court hearings. It hasn’t been talked about on this subreddit yet!   


In 2017, an odd letter (some sources claim it was an e-mail) was received by the Police station in Choszcznie City. A man, contending to be Zbigniew B., admitted to be a part of an unreported crime from 2002, describing all the details and names.

According to the letter and what prosecutors established later: In 2002, 5 friends Robert M., Janusz Sz., Sylwester B., Zbigniew B. and Rafał O. met together to drink in a fish bar in a small town Łasko. At some point during the evening, when all 5 men were drunken, an unidentified man entered the place, Robert M. recognized him as someone who owned him money. He kicked him out of the pub, beat him and thrown inside a trunk of Zbigniew’s car. 

All men got inside the car and drove to a nearby lake called Osiek. (next to Ługi Town). At the location, Robert lit a campfire and told Zbigniew ""You know what to do now"". 

Zbigniew M took the man from the trunk, battered him, then sit on him and slashed his throat, eventually chopping his head off completely. After that he took off the victim’s clothes, gutted him and cut the body into a 5 big chunks. Other men put these meat chunks on sticks and baked over the fire. When ready, all of them consumed the meat. 

After the feast, Robert got all remaining body parts inside a bag together with a stone, and deposed the bag in a middle of the lake by using an inflatable boat. 

Next morning, men took all remaining baked meat to their homes. One of the men, Rafał, even offered some of the meat to his flatmate, saying it’s a ""rabbit’s meat"". The man didn’t like the taste, knowing it’s definitely not a rabbit, he fed his dog with it. 

In 2017, after receiving the letter, police created a team codenamed ""Lecter"" and decided to investigate these allegations... and found that Zbigniew, the man who apparently sent the letter, was already dead for half of the year by the time. They raided homes of other men who were completely surprised and denied all the allegations. However, police wiretapped their phones and found out that men were contacting each other and conspiring together to say nothing to police. When interrogated, men claimed that wiretapped conversation was all about some victimless car accident few years prior, which they didn’t report because the driver had no driving license, and all of this is a big misunderstanding. Investigators confirmed that the accident had taken place. However they didn’t believe that the conversation was about it. Mostly because Zbigniew wasn’t present during the accident and the men would have nothing to worry about then. 

Police tried to track down the Zbigniew’s car and the inflatable boat but couldn’t find any real lead. The car apparently was sold for scrap years ago, and the only boat they found had some traces of blood but the boat was bought in early ’10. 

The lake had been searched using divers and scanners, but nothing was found. However, the bottom of the lake is very muddy so it’s difficult to be certain. In 2017, a local resident had found a human skull in other lake nearby. Laboratory test concluded that skull belonged to a 45-55 year-old woman or slim man, who died in within dozen or so years. DNA tests didn’t bring any results.

Police searched all missing persons cases in a region but nothing meaningful was found. The same goes for investigation regarding any personal grudges or conflicts involving Robert. 

Shortly after interrogations, one of the men, Rafał turned and admitted his guilt. Problem is that after psychiatric evaluation he was deemed having ""mild mental retardation"" and a memory impairment, moreover he was addicted to alcohol. However the judge didn’t exclude his testimony but sadly he had no clue about the identity of the victim. 

The case was quickly publized and media were asking people around. Local residents doubt in this story, including a mother of Zbigniew. She says he was mythomaniac who was obsessed with the Bible and - ""was more of a coward than aggressor"". When journalists tried to talk with Rafał he closed the doors and panicked, cursing journalists and saying he never ate any human meat and all his testimonies were coerced by the police. On the other hand, there are stories of Zbigniew talking crying about the crime when he was drunk in local pubs. 

The daughter of the prime suspect Robert is feeling devastated by the entire case. She doesn’t believe in the story, saying that ""all is based on some unreliable testimonies of few drunkards"". The children of Robert are bullied in school because ""their dad ate a human"". 

On the 27th of September, 2021, Robert was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison. All other men were acquitted because they didn’t take part in a murder itself, and charges of desecration of a corpse were expired. 

This is a really bizarre murder case as there is no victim, no corpse, not even a name.

958,mintwolves,[],1632827093," The date (May 9th 2022) has been set for former teacher and professional rugby league player Chris Dawson to stand trial for the alleged murder of his wife Lynette nearly 40 years ago. 

 The former Newtown Jets rugby league player has pleaded not guilty to murder; he has repeatedly claimed Lynette Dawson is alive and that several people have seen her since her disappearance in January 1982.

He was arrested and charged in April 2020 and has consistently maintained that he played no part in her disappearance from their Bay view home on Sydney’s northern beaches.

Lynette Joy Dawson a 33-year-old mother of two, disappeared from her Sydney home in 1982. Police have never found any trace of her.

Mr Dawson has always maintained she abandoned him and the children - possibly to join a religious group.

 An inquest in 2003 heard that Mr Dawson had sexual relationships with teenage students during his marriage, including with the family's babysitter at the time of his wife's disappearance. 

Dawson was having an affair with student Joanne Curtis who temporarily moved into the Dawson family home in October 1981 at Chris Dawson's invitation.

Lynette  was phoned by her mother on 8 January 1982, the last time they would communicate with each other. She planned to meet her mother and family at Northbridge Baths the following day, but she never arrived. Joanne Curtis moved in permanently with Chris Dawson just TWO DAYS later ( 10th January 1982).

Chris Dawson didn't report his wife missing until six weeks later ( 18th February 1982).

 The 2018 podcast, The Teacher's Pet, produced by the Australian newspaper, led to the case gaining prominence in Australia and internationally. It has had close to 30 million downloads. 

 Prosecutors have previously maintained there was insufficient evidence to lay charges.

However, in December 2018 - following the podcast - Mr Dawson was extradited from his home in Queensland to New South Wales, where he posted a A$1.5m (£820,000; $1m) bond for bail.

The podcast highlighted the bungled handling of Mrs Dawson's case by police in the early years after her disappearance, prompting a recent apology from the state's police commissioner.

Is Lynette still alive as Chris Dawson claims ? or was she murdered ?

May 2020 Phone Transcript

G.G.'s phone seemed to have not worked for several months and he blames it on a glitchy phone/spam filter. E.G. states she saw some minor changes around the house like her mother's flowers being moved. Then wonders why her father's family has been rude to her. G.G. states he hasn't talked to them in six or eight months. E.G. points out he saw them in February and that soon they'll visit for about a week.

December 1st, 2020 

Angela's Story is published on Dr.Phil ""I want to know where she is; says daughter of missing woman."" In it, she outlines that G.G. never refers to Angela as Angela but always as ""Mom"".  Never before revealed information was made public that Profiling evil had been found. Things about the home and life insurance policy. These tips had been turned into the police and they had permission to share. E.G. collected dirt samples from the Lawrence home and gave them to investigators. They placed the samples in different places and had cadaver dogs search for them. Each time the dogs mark all the samples positive. They turned this tip in as well. 

Angela and E.G. used to watch Dr. Phil together and so this is a bittersweet moment. 

December 22nd, 2020

A search of the Lawrence home happens sometime in December. The search was through the home and backyard. They said credible tips led them to search the property. The police said they did not find anything. 

This home had undergone a lot of construction by G.G. and his brother. According to E.G., they hired a pickup truck with cash and G.G. took off a few days of work. E.G. worries her mother's body could have been moved. 

LE said they questioned coworkers and neighbors but they didn't know anything.

This is a home that had positive's from the soil samples collected by E.G. for the Dr. Phil show. This is what finally allows the judge to sign a warrant for a search. This is also the home with the suspicious mound of dirt. Sergeant Adam Taylor was asked cadaver dogs were brought to search. Instead, the reply was; “We did dig by hand, though.”  

January 2021 

Detective. Sgt. Adam Taylor says Praire Village Police has had 150 leads in the case. 

January 9th - February 1st, 2021

Investigators are waiting on lab results for evidence involved in the disappearance. They are also working with the FBI and the KBI crime labs. They also say G.G. has not aided the investigation at all. Three total warrants have been issued at the time now and over 150 leads tracked. 

April 30th, 2021 

Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe publicly asks for information to come forward. Legally the case is a missing person but they are treating it as a homicide. 

September 10th, 2021

Go Fund Me is Created with the intent to fund a private investigator for Angela by her family. 

September 17th, 2021

Angela Green's case is going to court as a civil issue by wrongful death suit against her husband. The civil suit could uncover information that would help build a criminal case in the future. 

This is a missing person case #20200390 and it is currently under investigation. G.G. is not a named suspect or person of interest. The police admit his stories are concerning.  The maternal G. family was getting updates on the case once a month. 

Angela Green 

Angela Green has no known aliases but her family sometimes calls her Angie or Mom. At the time she disappeared she was 51 years old. Angela was born in Baoding, HeBei, or Xin He (Just outside of Tianjin) in China. April 15th, 1968 (Estimated) to parents who were professors. Angela's mother is still living in China and her father had passed away sometime after the year 2000. Angela has a sister C.G. who had moved to New York, USA some 10 years earlier to Angela. The two kept a relationship going even as their lives moved apart. C.G. has two daughters one of whom M.G. advocates for her Aunt Angela publicly. One niece is a lawyer and the other is a doctor. Angela vanished sometime after June 19th, 2019. Angela had been a proud American citizen for over twenty years. There were some rumors of her having dual citizenship in China. Angela grew up in China and studied English there as well. Angela was fluent in mandarin but her English was not perfect. 

Angela is Asian and in her American hometown of Prairie Village Kansas, she was in a very small minority. Angela was above average height about 5'7-5'9 and weighed below average at 110-115lbs. Angela had a light to medium skin tone and a slim body build. Angela has dark brown hair worn in a long bob with no middle part. In older photos, she preferred longer styles. Angela's face shape is a heart with a wide smile. Angela is a striking figure. In her photos, she is styled with makeup earrings and perfect clothing. I would describe her style as a beauty queen. 

Allegedly she had been cremated but there is no evidence for this. We do know that being cremated and having her ashes sent back to China was important to her. E.G. said she knew this was something her mother wanted as a cultural gesture.

In China, Angela worked in the insurance industry as well as journalism. Angela had done some newscasts in China. The family said that if she had stayed to pursue her career she would have excelled and had a bright future. 

Angela met her husband G.G. in Beijing China during the late 1990s while she was in her 20's. G.G. was working as a mechanic and car salesman and had learned of Angela through of a friend of her parents. They helped set up a date while he was on a work trip at the Hard Rock Cafe in Beijing. The courtship lasted one year and through the mail. This was Angela's first marriage and she wanted to have a family right away. They had a rushed marriage ceremony moving to Kansas quickly on a K9 Visa and had to be married within 90 days.  Angela was aware that G.G. did not have a lot of money when she married him. 

G.G. had not been honest with Angela about his age and he was 13 years older than her. Then he did not tell her about his earlier family. The ex-wife was surprised by the marriage because he had told no one. 

There were other troubling signs in the marriage but they were subtle. They treated each other as co-workers. They were not affectionate. They even slept in separate rooms.  . Angela had to ask for anything she needed and was conscious of all the money costs. Angela did not have a credit card or her own bank account. Angela cooked all the meals at home. Sister C.G. said that over time Angela only spoke in English on the phone. Often hear G.G. in the background as if he was always listening. 

Angela did not have a job in America and chose to stay home to devote her time to her daughter. This devotion is often described as an obsession that became stronger the older that E.G. become. E.G. said that her mother ""gave her life to me"" in one interview with Access Hollywood.

Angela was loving with her daughter but then very strict. There were no sleepovers, parties, and dates. Only school, piano, and homework.  Angela expected E.G. to strive for perfection.  No cellphone either until senior year of high school.

They two were close anyway. Described as a bit of a tiger mom who pushed her daughter to be better and better. Angela would take thousands of photos of her daughter mostly posed around her plants. The backyard was a safe place for the both of them and they made many memories there together. E.G. is convinced that if her mom is alive she would reach out. Angela used to handwrite intricate notes for her daughter daily. 

The family did not have a faith or tradition that they followed. 

Angela may have a history of mental health.  There was never any official diagnosis. One moment loving and protecting to E.G. the other aggressive and mean when E.G. would fail at something. Angela had a temper and would sometimes throw things at an argument. The maternal family describes her as temperamental and might not want to talk.

 Angela had a distrust for doctors and had only been to one to deliver her child. Angela did not leave her home without being accompanied by someone. This was usually either G.G. or E.G. and the reason is partly because of the language barrier. 

Angela did not have deep friendships. Neighbors loved her and the work she did around their neighborhood. Angela's ability to look beautiful and put together also made her intimidating. If someone tried to make friends they were redirected. The family home wasn't the type that you could just stop by and playdates had to have G.G. in for approvals. Angela did not use social media, did not text or even carry a phone with her. Sometimes Angela kept the home dark and crowded with items. The darkened windows would spurn neighborhood rumors that she may have been depressed. 

  Angela Green overall was described as a very kind and thoughtful person. A beauty who was reserved and selfless and a smart person. Angela was an avid gardener and took care of her yard and the neighborhood free spaces. Some of her favorite plants were hostas, azaleas, and yuccas. Angela could cook and enjoyed cooking dumplings and spring rolls with her daughter. 

Angela did next-level things like taking on extra projects at her daughter's school. Making other children costumes or bringing lunches for teachers. Sometimes E.G. would be annoyed by her mother's perfection and wish that she could be like this as well.  Angela would make small talk with neighbors. Decorate the area, especially with American flags. Holidays were Angela's specialty and she would make everything perfect. 

E.G.

E. G. has no known aliases and no known family nicknames. At the time her mother disappeared I believe she was 18 or 19 yrs old. Born around September (Estimated) she was Angela's only daughter. E.G. lived in Prairie Village her whole life. She went to Shawnee Mission schools from kindergarten through senior year.

At the time of her mother's disappearance, E.G. was a freshman or sophomore in college. E.G. studied business honors in finance and data analytics, at KU.  Before this career field, she started in engineering and computer science. Recently, E.G. switched to journalism at Colorado State. The idea was to help people similar to her situation. December 2021 she will have graduated with a degree in journalism. 

E.G. is fluent in mandarin and would converse with her mother in her mother's native language. E.G. can speak four languages in total, Spanish, Russian, English, and mandarin. Sometimes, E.G. had to be the mediator between her father and mother because they didn't speak a common language. E.G. excels in school and was ahead of her college class.

E.G. is caucasian and Asian and of slim build, and fair skin tone. E.G. wears her hair in a long style sometimes parted down the middle. Hair is often dyed blonde, her natural hair is a dark brown like her mother's. E.G. has down brown eyes, and a heart faces shape that is similar to her mother's. E.G. has a striking style and often wears nice clothing and wears accessories. Wearing makeup in a subtle glam style. If I didn't know her I would say she was a beauty queen.

E.G. attended a beauty pageant around August 13, 2021, Northern Colorado's annual Miss Colorado USA and Miss Teen Colorado USA. It was her first-time pageant and she hoped to win to use the platform to put the spotlight on her missing mother. E.G. said her mother wanted her to become a pageant queen. Previously, they didn't have the funds to compete but between donors and other support, E.G. now can. 

E.G.'s personality is described as a thinker, even-tempered,   and sometimes aloof. It's her mother that she thinks of often and she hopes to make her proud by standing up for her and giving her a voice. E.G. is outspoken when she needs to be and willing to ask the harder questions to find the truth. E.G. thinks math and science can explain almost everything. Currently, E.G. is working with Sarah Turney and has started to advocate through TikTok and podcasts.

G.G.

G. M. G.  has an alias using a different spelling of his name and his family will shorten up his name to a more common pronunciation and spelling. G.G. was born October 31, 1951, in New York City, NY, USA. G.G. has an ex-wife and had a daughter with her. Then one daughter with his wife Angela. Everyone including his daughter E.G. and the police has commented on his love for his daughter. G.G.'s family that are known are the Aunt. M and Uncle B. that would be his brother and sister and law. They had moved to Kansas City five years ago. Angela had even helped them move and carried their furniture. They have refused to help with the case or talk about Angela at all. 

G.G. is caucasian, of slim and tall build, and fair-skinned. G.G. has light grey hair with a balding hairline. G.G. has a large oval-shaped face and large ears.

During the 1990's he worked as a car mechanic and salesman and likes to look back fondly on his time in China. In later years he worked in IT at the federal courthouse in Kansas City Missouri for 20+ years. In December of 2019 or 2020, he retired from this. Co-workers declined to make comments on G.G.

G.G. collects vintage cars and has a special property for them. In google maps, you can see there was nearly always a covered car out front of the home. In later years after his wife's disappearance and through the pandemic G.G. began to get into home renovations and landscaping. 

Even though he spent time in China and his wife was Chinese G.G. does not speak multiple languages. During his wife's disappearance, G.G. has given inconsistent stories and minimal emotions. In one of the stories, he mentions that he thought maybe his wife faked her death to hurt him but gave no supporting evidence. Paul Cramm, is G.G.'s criminal defense lawyer and admitted to representing him but declines to comment.

G.G. Described by his daughter as a skeptical thinker, mellow and more patient than her mother, also putting himself first.   Tight with his money. Good with taxes and paperwork. Never physically violent. Leaves his cellphone at home as a habit. A quiet man of few words. 

G.G. tells his daughter that he realizes he is probably a primary suspect. Then he cautions his daughter against talking to the police. 

Possible Connected Cases And Rule-Outs

Amber Aiaz and her daughter Melissa Fu

Profiling Evil had partnered with Dr. Phil to help investigate the case and they put together a massive story map. It's invaluable but they also have a missing person and unclaimed bodies that were Asian women since June 19th, 2019 map on their profile is extensive so please check it out.

Theories And Lose Notes (This section is pure speculation and a collection of thoughts across the internet. In no way does anything here accuse anyone of anything. Please, take this section with a massive tablespoon of salt. ) 

The number one most prevailing theory is that husband G.G. had something to do with the death or disappearance of Angela Green. G.G. himself states that he is aware that the LE would look at him as a suspect because of statistics. However, the inconsistent stories, the criminal defense lawyer, and unwillingness to aid investigators have the public, the family, and even the police concerned.

Possible motivations for G.G. could include; protecting his daughter from his wife's mental illness. Protecting himself from his wife's mental illness. Finally having enough of his wife's mental illness. Covering and protecting his daughter who may have done something. Covering an accidental death from the argument. 

Another theory is that it was actually E.G. who was the one who harmed Angela. Most people don't have any evidence to support the idea but base it off on their dislike of her personality and demeanor. Some think that E.G. didn't work fast enough, or did nothing at all until her maternal family stepped into the picture. I would like to point out the E.G. herself explains on several occasions that her mother was constantly photographing her and sometimes making her retake photos if they were not perfect. This strive for perfection when cameras are on could explain her current demeanor around them. There are other factors as well such as coming from a conservative home, going from privacy to the world knowing everything about you, and mostly experiencing the loss of an important figure in her life. 

Possible motivations for E.G. could include; Snapping under the pressure of her mother's requirement of control and perfection. Perhaps, a dislike for her family and framing her family, and lastly an accident involvement with an argument gone wrong. 

The police did it/corruption theory is the idea that the police were involved or someone in the family had a connection as to have this case ignored and not investigated. 

The World Events theory; when of her disappearance the pandemic was ramped. All eyes were on China and in the midwest, there were currents of racism with people picking up the slogan ""Chinese virus"" There's the idea that perhaps someone took her out of angry at the current events, or perhaps she was forcefully deported. Homeland security did confirm that no record of her travel existed by plane, train, or bus and she had been a lawful American Citizen for many years. 

Then it was an insane accident theory... the idea that the father well-meaning attempted to get her mental health care but reached out to scam artists instead. 

Angela made a new life theory. That she ran away on purpose after finding out her only daughter didn't need her anymore. This theory is often rebuffed by E.G. saying that she didn't think her mother would not reach out. 

Angela framed G.G. this is similar to she made a new life theory but it adds upon it with him the through Angela went out of her way to frame her husband to hurt him. G.G. himself subscribed to this idea at one point. Also, rebuffed by E.G. who thinks her mother would eventually reach out to her. 

Angela returned to china theory but that is rebuffed by sister C.G. who said that she did not go back to China, because Angela's mother is still in contact with the family in the USA. In addition, the department of homeland security also confirmed there was no record of her traveling by plane, train, or bus. Angela's keys, passport, driver's license was left at her home. 

Angela protected her daughter's theory. Some think that Angela kicking her daughter out had nothing to do with the fight they were having and all to do with the husband wanting to cause harm to both of them. Something thinks that Angela did this act as a way to protect her daughter. 

Angela committed suicide theory. The idea is that after kicking her daughter out of her house she committed suicide and her husband covered up her death to protect his daughter. This circumstantial evidence for this is Angela's lack of mental health care. 

Random note but that red urn looks like it could have been purchased from Amazon as Amazon has similar ones. From the FB page family says that LE found records of G.G. purchasing an urn himself online. 

Profiling Evil said while listening to the conversations between E.G. and her father was constantly reflecting on the conversation. Instead of following a yes-no narrative that E.G. tried to do, he kept going back to a reflection conversation. 

Would E.G. be able to state what clothing items her mother was last wearing? 

How did E.G. know her mother's wishes about cremation and sending back to China? Did they have a conversation about her death before?  

A theory that Angela's body was taken or hidden in construction wastes during G.G.'s construction phase on his properties. 

Psychics/Mystics/Readings/Spiritual 

I've seen a few spiritual comments where they've felt that Angela was near or in water. Some feel that she was buried deep or far.

Conclusion

“There’s no way with how much she cared for me, and there’s no way that she would just up and leave,” E.G. said. E.G. does not think that her mother is alive anymore and just wants the truth of what happened.

961,rickjames_experience,[],1632785188,"So i was talking with a friend about the mad gasser of mattoon and we started to try and think outside the box. we came up with some info that i havent actually seen mentioned at all in articles or other posts about it. 
1. there was a mad gasser of botetourt county Virginia in 1933, where people described finding *womens footprints* there as well, and seeing 4 people fleeing into the woods after chlorine gas attacks. 
2. there are 3 military bases around mattoon and a national guard station in the town as well. 
3. from 1945-1980 the US military did experiments and tests on humans using mustard gas, which supposedly the chemical used in the mattoon gassings is a precursor of or something along those lines. tetrachloride and trichloroethylene. atlas imperial, the factory closest to the town, reported that they only had a few gallons of these chemicals, which were secured. 

For anybody who hasn't read about the mad gasser of mattoon i highly recommend it, as its very bizarre and interesting. a chemistry teacher and mattoon local wrote a book on the event, claiming that the culprit was a chemist named Farley Llewellyn. Llewellyn had built a lab behind his familys store, and before the gassings there was an explosion at his lab. Llewellyn was an outcast who had a plan to ""blow up the town"" as he had some sort of grievance with the town. he was sent to a state mental institution where he remained until his death. the chemical that caused the explosion at his lab was nitromethane, which is highly volatile, sweet smelling, and causes similar symptoms to what people experienced (burning of the mouth, facial swelling, leg paralysis, etc).

what do you guys think about this? i think a similar event 11 years before some 750 miles away is notable, as is the womans footprints and how someone said they believe they saw a woman dressed as a man at the scene of a gassing. it's just all very strange and id love to hear other peoples thoughts and theories on this.

962,Golden--Lady,[],1632784153,"Your cameras will record for 12 hours. There's a ""violence filter"" so any violence will be blurred. (The point of this exercise isn't to capture awful things on tape but to see who was involved.)

Where/when would you put your cameras, and why?

1. I would put my first camera in the ""wine cellar"" at  755 15th St., Boulder, CO at 4:00 pm on Dec. 25, 1996. I want to see who entered and exited this room while the family was away at the Christmas party and at 2:00 am when the neighbor heard a scream and the sound of metal on concrete. 

I believe an intruder entered the home while the family was away for hours and violently bludgeoned, strangled, sexually assaulted, and put tape over the mouth of this little girl. He'd left the ransom note on the stairs earlier as an impromptu FU to the parents, with quotes inspired by the  movies Ransom, Speed, Ruthless People and Nick of Time.

I don't believe by-all-accounts-loving parents — with no history of crime or abuse before or after this murder —  would attack and desecrate their little girl so horribly to cover up an accident caused by their little boy. I want the perpetrator caught, and I think the unknown male DNA found in this murdered child's underwear and long johns will solve this case.

2. I would put my second camera at the vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue at 8:00 PM on Jan. 14, 1947. I want to see who dumped and posed the body of Elizabeth Short. 

Retired LAPD detective Steve Hodel has made an excellent case that his father - child savant, VD doctor, journalist, avant garde publisher, and friend-to-surrealist artists and Hollywood stars - killed Elizabeth and posed her as a gruesome ""artwork"".  [Hodel’s blog](https://stevehodel.com/blog/) and books go into great detail on this case. The Root of Evil podcast and book ""Exquisite Corpse: Surrealism and the Black Dahlia Murder"" are fascinating looks also.

I want to know if it was Hodel or someone else. Steve has his naysayers, probably because he claims his father killed many others, including Zodiac's victims. Sounds crazy, but I think he makes some compelling points, such as similarities between anonymous notes sent to police in both the Short and Zodiac murders. (It's exceedingly rare for killers to taunt police with anonymous notes.)

Here are a few which stood out to me that I don't recall seeing in previous posts. Due to the length of some of these descriptions, I've included links and a brief summary next to each.

[Susan Walsh](https://charleyproject.org/case/susan-walsh) \- Susan Walsh was a freelance journalist and exotic dancer at the time of her 1996 disappearance. No trace of her has ever been found but its speculated her disappearance could have been connected to her work as a dancer, her involvement in Vampire subculture, or crime syndicates she was investigating as part of her journalistic work.

[Kathleen Kelly](https://charleyproject.org/case/kathleen-kelly) \- Kathleen Kelly vanished after leaving her older sister's home in either 1980 or 1981. Her family would receive mysterious phone calls in later years leading them to believe that Kelly could still be alive.

[Logan Lynn Tucker](https://charleyproject.org/case/logan-lynn-tucker) \- Logan Lynn Tucker went missing in 2002 under suspicious and unclear circumstances. It seems much of the information in this case points to one conclusion, but the circumstances surrounding it are notably tragic and leave some questions unanswered.

[Nelda Louise Hardwick](https://charleyproject.org/case/nelda-louise-hardwick) \- Nelda Louise Hardwick went missing from her Louisiana home in the nighttime/early morning hours of October 14th 1993. She left a note saying she was going to the store but never returned. Years later a body would be found that was believed to be her and investigators would state they believed it possible that Hardwick was held in captivity for years following her disappearance.

In December 9th 1999, the body of a woman who had been beaten, whipped and burnt was found in a forest preserve in Chicago. She was ultimately beaten to death with a bottle. The autopsy ruled she died less than 12 hours before being found, and was mentally disabled in life. 

Although they couldn’t identify her police zeroed in on a suspect. A man mamed Jeremy Tweedy talked to an undercover officer at a motel and said he’d seen the Jane Doe arriving at the motel where she was taken into a room with six men who apparently killed her. 

He identified the ringleader of these men as Jeremy Strong. He confessed and claimed he killed her because she stole his burrito of all things and that she was a homeless woman. In October 2000, he was convicted of the murder along with his friend Jason Johnson. 

However, in January 2006, they found a possible ID for their doe. This was a missing 34yo woman from Carpentersville, IL. She was reported missing on 4th September 1999 and her name was Mary Kate Chamizo. Dental records confirmed she was the Doe.

Her ID threw a spanner in Jeremys conviction because Mary Kate wasn’t homeless or known to travel. A reexamination proved she’d actually died a couple of days before she was found, meaning the story of her murder didn’t hold up at all. Jeremy and Jason took everything back , and said they’d been threatened into confessing. 

Looking into Mary’s life, things only got stranger. She lived with a mom and daughter duo (the Lewises) who were known to take in disabled and elderly people to leech money from. They drew large amounts out Mary’s bank account and continued to after her death. Mary also stopped contacting her family while she was with them. 

They also set Mary up with a man named Gonzalo Chamizo who became her husband. He was troubled and had a history of violence, and in 2002, told police he killed Mary. He said  he buried her in his backyard but nothing was found.

Her murder is unsolved. It’s incredibly strange she died so long after being Reported missing and was dumped far from home.

968,According_Try_9843,[],1632731008,"The Voynich Manuscript is without a doubt the most mysterious book in the world: 240 pages long, created some 600 years ago and, most importantly, written in a completely unknown and undecipherable language, filled with pictures of plants that modern science has no records of. The book emerged in Central Europe in the late 15th century, but the original author is unknown and it is now a part of the Yale University Collection of Rare Manuscripts. It has a small but passionate community of academics and researchers around it who dedicate their careers to cracking its mystery.   


There are two main theories about what the text of the manuscript could be that most academics focus on:  


A) Some kind of an obscure, forgotten language that is completely different from everything we know of today. Linguists have already proposed pretty much everything, from Latin, ancient Hebrew, or even Aztec language Nahuatl, but all of those theories were eventually debunked.   
or

B) Some kind of a code or a cipher, meant to hide the real content of the book from anyone who doesn't have the key. The problem is, however, that the top cryptographers, including teams of FBI and NSA experts, have tried decoding it, using everything from traditional methods to AI-driven decoding programs, but so far with no success.   


The point is, however, that dozens of experts from both fields have been trying to prove one of these two theories and crack the code/identify the language for almost a 100 years by now. My guess is that this makes both of those theories highly unlikely, purely because of the amount of highly qualified effort that went into it with zero success.   


What seems to make a lot more sense is a bit of a controversial theory, promoted mostly by Dr. Gordon Rugg and which most academics researching the manuscript are not very fond of. This theory says that the content of the manuscript is just a bunch of completely made-up text alongside random illustrations which cannot be translated or decoded because it doesn't have any meaning at all. And which was created intentionally as a scam, with the purpose of creating a mysterious-looking exotic book which could be then sold to rich collectors and people with interest in the occult, back in the 15th century.   


It is really hard or almost impossible to prove something like this, but it does seem to make a lot more sense than the possibility that someone came up with a code that we are still not able to crack, even with our advanced knowledge of cryptography, or that we are not able to identify an unknown language even though we have been able to do it with pretty much all of the ancient, forgotten language that were discovered. I'd be curious to get a feedback from the community.

972,TheBonesOfAutumn,[],1632696682,"The morning of September 13, 1989, started out as a typical day for the Bova family of Merrillville, Indiana. 43-year-old Joseph Bova readied for work while his wife, 46-year-old Sharon Bova, sat in the kitchen sipping her morning coffee. At approximately 6am, Joseph bid farewell to his wife and exited the couple's modest home located at 6686 Massachusetts Avenue. 

At 6:04am, Joseph climbed into his 1974 Ford pickup truck to head to a local diner to have breakfast with his brother before work. Seconds later, a violent explosion rattled the windows and doors of the usually quiet middle class neighborhood. Alarmed, Sharon went to investigate the sound, only to be met by a scene of utter chaos outside.

Debris covered the lawn and Joseph’s Ford, now a misshapen mass of metal, sat smoking in the couples driveway. Sharon found her husband lying face down in the yard approximately 50 feet away from his vehicle, nearly completely dismembered and barely conscious. Sadly, at 6:40am, Joseph Bova was declared DOA at Methodist Hospital Southlake. His cause of death was listed as blood loss and severe trauma. 

An intense investigation by agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms revealed that Joseph’s death had been caused by a pipe bomb placed under the hood of his truck. The bomb, which was 2 inches in diameter and 8 inches long, was placed atop the transmission of the truck and then wired to the ignition. The explosion had been so powerful, it had reshaped the vehicle into a pyramid of wrecked steel, caving in the dash and blowing out the floor and windows. ATF agents called it “the work of professionals.” 

The search for both Joseph’s killer and a motive for the murder began, however it was quickly learned that Joesph Bova had no known enemies. He had been employed as a financial secretary and part-time field representative for Laborers Local 81 in Valparaiso, Indiana since 1988. According to fellow employees, there was nothing controversial about him. 

Joseph was described as a quiet family man, and a “hell of a friend and worker.”  He didn’t drink or do drugs, and had no issues in his marriage. According to all who knew him, Joseph was exceedingly kind and caring, even going out of his way the previous winter to feed the stray cats that had gathered at the town's Steel mill. 

An attempt to find a witness of any kind proved unsuccessful. To complicate matters even more, investigators learned that Joseph had ridden to work with a coworker the two previous days before the explosion, leaving them to question when the device had been placed inside of the truck's hood. 

Whispers began to circulate that perhaps the bombing had been the result of the Union's rumored relations with members of crime syndicates. However after a thorough investigation, this theory was discounted by local law enforcement and ATF agents. A 30,000 dollar reward was offered for any information leading to the arrest of Joseph’s murderer, unfortunately the few tips investigators received ultimately led nowhere and the case quickly went cold. 

While they have never been officially connected to Joseph’s case, I thought it was worth mentioning that over the next 4 years, two more incidents involving pipe bombs occurred in the area. 

In January of 1990, less than 6 miles away from Merrillville, two loud explosions awoke the residents of Crown Point, Indiana. At approximately 2:30 am, two pipe bombs detonated on the property of the Hall family, one on their front porch, and one that was left near their patio door. The explosions left the windows shattered, and caused significant damage to the exterior of the home, however none of the five members of the Hall family were injured. Just like in Joseph Bova’s case, investigators could find no motive or suspects behind the bombing. 

Three years later, on August 23, 1993, yet another pipe bomb would be discovered in Merrillville. That morning, police were summoned to Precision DriveLine, a company that distributed driveshafts and clutches to auto part stores. An employee who was heading out to make a delivery noticed a strange wire protruding from the right rear fender of a company truck. After a careful examination, the employee discovered a large pipe bomb hidden on the underside of the vehicle. A bomb squad was able to successfully remove the device and detonate it in a secure location, however like the two previous bombings, neither a motive nor a suspect was ever revealed. 

According to family, Sharon was never the same after the loss of her husband. She fell into a deep depression and stopped going to work. Eventually she even refused to answer calls or visits from family and friends. Sadly, in 2009 Sharon passed away. According to family, she died of “a broken heart.” 

While the Bova’s didn’t have any children, Joseph’s nephew, who was 9-years-old when his uncle’s life was taken, continues to peruse answers about his uncle’s murder. He fears however, that with no suspects, witnesses, or motive, the case may never be solved.

Summary

Convicted murderer Margaret Rudin maintains her innocence 20 years later: Part 1She was convicted of killing her husband Ron Rudin, but some say she had an unfair trial. Her husband was a successful real estate mogul in Las Vegas in the 1980s and 1990s.Margaret Rudin

Since the 1994 murder and beheading of her husband, authorities have pointed to Margaret Rudin, with many calling her a “Black Widow.” She has since passed on five plea deals, proclaiming her innocence, and just finished 20 years in prison for the crime she insists she didn’t commit.
Rudin and several key figures in her trial have questioned the fairness of the proceedings. Today, at 77-years-old, she’s pushing for a new trial that she hopes might exonerate her.


Her husband, Ron Rudin, had charm and knew how to use it. As new construction boomed in Las Vegas in the 1980s and ‘90s, he quickly became a successful mogul in the industry and a powerful figure within the community.
Although Ron Rudin would stay away from the glitz of casinos, he enjoyed other pleasures like his signature slick black cowboy boots and his “huge armory full of guns,” according to former Las Vegas detective Don Charleboix.

But as his business ventures in Las Vegas continued to grow, he found that his love life would not find similar success. Ron Rudin’s third wife, Peggy June Lee Rudin suffered from depression and was found shot in the head in their home. Although police investigated whether Ron was involved in her death, ultimately authorities determined she died by suicide.
When Ron Rudin met his soon-to-be fifth wife Margaret Mason in 1987, it was just months after he had split with his fourth wife.
“He was charming,” Margaret Rudin told “20/20” in her first interview since being released from prison in January 2020. “I tell you, I've never met anybody better and slicker and smarter and suaver than he was.”
Margaret Rudin had also been married four times prior before coming to Las Vegas looking for a fresh start. She had met her fourth husband in Las Vegas, but was divorced soon after. She met Ron Rudin at church, the two fell fast and hard in love and were married soon after in 1987.

However, the marriage quickly darkened. Margaret Rudin said that her husband tried to confess to Peggy June Lee Rudin’s murder.
“One night when we were watching some crime story, he said to me quietly, ‘What would you say if I told you I murdered Peggy?’ And I kind of caught my breath and I didn't know what to say because if I just said, 'Yes, I want the details,' I would have had to have left,” said Rudin. “I just said, ‘No, no, you’re not going to relieve your guilt by telling me. I don’t want to know.’”
She said that the two never spoke about it again.
Rumors of infidelity began to swirl between Margaret andRon Rudin, which she denied. The discontent between them came to a head one night after she overheard her husband talking to an ex-girlfriend. She said he slapped her, and in self-defense, she grabbed one of their many guns.
“He wrestled it out of my hand and I knew that was the closest to death I was ever going to get by the look on his face,” said Margaret Rudin. “Instead of me, he shot a beautiful oil painting.”

Difficulties seemingly continued to persist within the Rudin home. According to Ron Rudin's trust attorney, in 1991, four years into their marriage, Ron Rudin said that Rudin was becoming “vicious and violent.”
Without naming Rudin specifically, he then executed a secret directive to the trustees of his estate that would stipulate a thorough investigation in the event he meets death by ""violent means"" as well to ""totally exclude"" any beneficiary their share of his estate ""should death be caused, directly or indirectly, by a beneficiary.”
Without naming Rudin specifically, he executed a secret directive that would stipulate a thorough investigation in the event he meets death by ""violent means"" as well to ""totally exclude"" any beneficiary part of his estate ""should death be caused, directly or indirectly, by a beneficiary.”
However, two years later, things between the couple seemed to have improved because he increased her share of his fortune from 40 percent to 60 percent. It's alleged that Ron Rudin’s paranoia was in part due to the great deal of stress he was facing at work in anticipation of a huge land deal.

At the time, Ron Rudin was working on development of an RV resort called The Retreat at Lee Canyon and some were raising questions about the source of the project’s funding, according to Margaret Rudin’s attorney Greg Mullanax.
“Ron had some mob ties in his days,” claims Mullanax. “He, at one point, apparently approached some people that were affiliated with organized crime seeking money to help develop this place.”
Margaret Rudin said her husband became increasingly paranoid.
“He had a horrible fear of people, and he had guns, but he was still always afraid,” she recalled, adding that he almost always carried a gun.

Ron Rudin disappears

Margaret Rudin said she last saw her husband alive on Dec. 18, 1994. It was the grand opening of her new antique store in a strip mall her husband had owned.
“I was excited about it because Ron was happy and being supportive. I thought it was going to be perfect,” she said.
Margaret Rudin said she returned home from the opening around 2 a.m. on Sunday Dec. 19 to find her husband’s car missing and the burglar alarms turned off. Although she thought it was strange, she didn’t think much of it and went to bed, she said.
She claims that the next morning, when Ron Rudin didn’t show up to work, she realized something might’ve gone wrong.
“I knew something he was going to be doing that most people didn't know about,” she said. “He was selling the Lee Canyon property on Wednesday, so I knew that he might want to see it one last time.”

After calling his co-workers and relatives, Margaret Rudin said she tried to report her husband missing, but that she was told to call back if he was still missing after 48 hours. Police said that Ron Rudin’s co-workers urged his wife to file a police report. Detectives were sent to the house to investigate two days later on Dec. 20, 1994.
His co-workers and friends immediately pointed to Margaret Rudin. When his secretary told former co-worker John Reuher that he hadn't shown up, he said he turned to his wife and said, ""I think Margaret did something to Ron, because Ron always called.""
Margaret Rudin believes that because investigators were so focused on her, they may have overlooked another possible motive for Rudin’s husband’s disappearance: the Lee Canyon development project.
“They talked to Margaret, and took a statement from her, and they asked Margaret if they could search her house and she agreed. They didn’t see anything out of the ordinary,” said Mullanax.”I think she was low-hanging fruit.”
Four days after Ron Rudin’s disappearance, his prized Cadillac was found outside a gentleman’s club in Las Vegas. The vehicle, which everyone who knew him said was typically spotless, was covered in dirt and mud. Investigators also found four sets of muddy footprints in the interior of the car.

Investigators say they didn’t find fingerprints from either Margaret Rudin or her husband in the car.
Despite the clues from the Cadillac, weeks went by without any leads. On Jan. 3, 1995, trustees of Ron Rudin’s estate set a $25,000 reward for information leading to Ron Rudin’s discovery.
On the night of Jan. 21, 1995 the next big break in the case happened. Fishermen were walking back from a nearby river some 60 miles outside Las Vegas when they discovered Ron Rudin’s skull.
“When the cops came to tell me about Ron … your mind can't take so much at one time,” Margaret Rudin remembered. “They had said that Ron's skull had been found, that he was dead. He'd been shot. I was in shock.
The skull had four bullet holes and Ron Rudin’s namesake diamond bracelet was found nearby.
“The skull, the bracelet, the Cadillac, it's all left there intentionally. It's the old mob movie,” said J.B. Casell, a friend of Margaret and Ron Rudin.
Investigators soon discovered the rest of his remains scattered nearby, as well as tucked inside an old trunk that had been burned in the same area where the fishermen had found his skull. Some began to speculate that the trunk belonged to Margaret Rudin since she owned an antique store.

“The trunk did become crucial because the hardware was said to be from a humpback trunk,” said former prosecutor Gary Guymon. “[We believe] there was a receipt that came back to a humpback trunk in her inventory, but there was no humpback trunk at the store.”
Two days after Ron Rudin’s remains were found, as suspicion was mounting against Margaret Rudin, police received a phone call from handyman Augustine Lovato. He’d come forward with information, claiming he was hired by Rudin to do work at her home just days after her husband had disappeared.
Lovato told investigators that he saw blood in the bedroom and bathroom while doing work in her home.
At the time, detectives had already done a cursory search of Rudin’s shop and house, and hadn’t found anything that would cause them to investigate Rudin further, according to former Las Vegas Homicide Det. Wayne Peterson.
“Well, it's awfully strange. The two missing persons detectives were out here, and they didn't see any blood. How did Lovato see something that wasn't there however many days before?” said Rudin.

She said she had hired Lovato, but not to do renovations in her home. Despite this, Lovato’s call led police to believe Rudin may have shot and killed her husband in the bedroom. Lovato eventually collected the $25,000 reward the trustees of Ron Rudin’s estate had posted.
Even with the lack of forensic evidence connecting Margaret Rudin to her husband’s death at the time, she still remained a suspect. She said the media began to exacerbate the problem, too.
“They stuck the name on me. That ‘black widow, black widow, black widow,’ like I had killed somebody before, or like that I was in the habit,” said Margaret Rudin.

New evidence in the criminal investigation

In January 1996, nearly two years after Ron Rudin’s remains were found, Margaret Rudin was battling her husband’s trustees over receiving her share under the will of his fortune. Out of her husband’s millions, Margaret Rudin settled for $600,000, but she said she only received $179,000 after attorney fees.
The criminal investigation had stalled and police were still searching for a key piece of evidence: the murder weapon.
By chance, a gun had been discovered a year earlier by scuba divers at a scuba school in Lake Mead.
The gun was placed in a police storage locker for over a year. Guymon said detectives in the Rudin case decided to test it. The ballistics test found that the bullet fragment found in Ron Rudin’s skull matched the gun found in the lake.
“It was a gun that had a silencer on it, so it all made sense that this could be a gun that was used in the actual crime scene itself,” said Guymon.
Moreover, Ron Rudin had reported the same type of gun missing to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 1988 shortly after he had separated from Margaret Rudin, according to Guymon. Cops began to theorize that she had taken it and used it on him.


“I think it's a stretch to argue that Margaret, for six years, hid this gun so she could use it on him in December of 1994,” said Mullanax.
“The problem with that is they can't connect the murder weapon to Margaret. They can't ever put the gun in Margaret's hand,” added Mullanax.
For two years, prosecutors tried and failed to indict Rudin based on the handyman’s testimony, the evidence in the Cadillac and the trunk where Ron Rudin’s remains were found, but they were unsuccessful.
Guymon said the gun “was a big, big linchpin in the case because all of a sudden, now we had this murder weapon.”

Guymon said the gun “was a big, big linchpin in the case because all of a sudden, now we had this murder weapon.”


Margaret Rudin was indicted three years after the disappearance of her husband. On April 17, 1997, she was indicted by a Clark County grand jury for the crimes of unauthorized surreptitious intrusion of privacy by listening device, murder with use of deadly weapon and accessory to murder. A warrant was issued for her arrest.
When investigators called Margaret Rudin’s attorney to serve the warrant, they realized she had left a month before the indictment.
“Well, she left before she was ever indicted,” said Mullanax, who was not her attorney at the time. “And there's no crime about leaving and going anywhere if you're not under indictment.”

FBI's Most Wanted List: Margaret Rudin on the run

At the end of March 1997, Margaret Rudin claims she was fed up with the chaos into which her life had descended.
“At that time, I think I was so ready for a nervous breakdown, I didn't think that far ahead. I just wanted to get out of Vegas,” she said.”I wanted peace of mind.”
Margaret Rudin added that she couldn’t even get a job and was running out of money because she had been pegged as the “Black Widow” of Las Vegas.

“Everything had gone wrong,” she said. “The way [the investigation] was handled by police and prosecutors, I did not feel comfortable anymore because they can do whatever they want to do with somebody's life. I wasn't going to get a chance to prove myself.”
She was able to rent a small apartment in Guadalajara, Mexico, in a building occupied mostly by other Americans, and quickly became accustomed to the downtown scene. She said she befriended a fugitive who taught her how to survive while on the run.
“The number one thing is be so careful where you live. ... The other is, always have a bag packed. Have money, ID, clothes. Make sure you have whatever it is you need the most in that bag,” she said of what she had learned.
Margaret Rudin, who had always been known for her sense of style, became a master of disguise.
“I like to wear wigs. I like short. I like long. I like curly. I like straight. I don't wanna look the same way all the time,” she said. “I like change. I'm a Gemini.”
With help from her friend, Joe Lundergan, a former Boston firefighter, Margaret Rudin moved back to the U.S. and settled in Phoenix in 1998. She said she moved back to be closer to her family.
“My mother was in the hospital, very sick. Once you have children and grandchildren, you can't go somewhere else and live and act like you're having a normal life,” said Margaret Rudin, who added that Lundergan was never her boyfriend.


She was going by the name Ann while living in a YMCA and working at a nearby hotel.
After a co-worker recognized her in an episode of “America’s Most Wanted,” and reported her to officers, Margaret Rudin said she slipped away just in time.
“I picked up my bag, called a limo service, which we used at the hotel, and I said, ‘Would you please pick me up on the side entrance,’"" she said. “I was a fugitive again. It is funny. I mean, how often could you be that lucky?”
Margaret Rudin said she had gotten a message from Lundergan that he had recently had surgery and needed her help. She left for Revere, Massachusetts, to live with and take care of him. By that time, the FBI had put her on its Most Wanted List.


She thought she could remain anonymous in the small town, and established herself within the new community under a different name.
“I really like Massachusetts. I like the people,” said Margaret Rudin. “They're very honest and sincere and forthright.”
She was able to evade law enforcement across international and state borders for nearly two years when a mundane errand led authorities back to her.
“They had no idea where she was until they got a tip that Margaret Rudin was in fact mailing packages from a Revere post office,” said Massachusetts state police officer Mark Lynch. “So we immediately went over to the post office and showed her picture.”
Lynch said that a post office employee confirmed that the woman in the picture was Margaret Rudin and told the officers where she lived.
In a fitting way to catch what investigators called a “chameleon,” they came up with a sting operation that centered around an officer posing as a pizza man.
“They came in like gangbusters,” Margaret Rudin said. “When they're coming down this narrow hallway and they’re coming in with their guns drawn, you'd have thought I was a real mobster.”

Margaret Rudin stands trial for murder

Margaret Rudin was caught by the FBI and local Massachusetts state authorities in 1999. Her arrest sparked a media frenzy. By March 2, 2001, the then 57-year-old had been on the run for 30 months. In a widely televised trial, she sat in the Las Vegas Clark County courthouse.
Prosecutors pinned Margaret Rudin with a narrative of a betrayed wife that killed her husband for his fortune.


“We were arguing Margaret Rudin didn't have the motive ... because she was in the will,” said Tom Pitaro, one of Rudin's defense attorneys at trial.
The scorched trunk where Ron Rudin’s body was found became a major piece of evidence for the prosecution. Antique dealer Bruce Honanbach came forward and testified early in the trial that he had sold Margaret Rudin a trunk.
“They said Margaret had stuffed the body in [the trunk] somehow, burned it... They're trying to tie the trunk to Margaret,” said Pitaro.


Months later, antique dealer Donald Schaupeter came forward to say Honanbach was wrong about the trunk.
Schaupeter said on the stand that Honabach was mistaken by which trunk he had been sold.
""Bruce, that little case is too small to put a cadaver in,"" he had said during his testimony.
But, the jury did not hear from Schaupeter until after the defense rested its case.
The prosecution, who believed that Margaret Rudin must have had help in discarding her husband’s body, brought Margart Rudin’s friend Yehuda Sharon to the stand. The police had surveilled the two of them together after Ron Rudin disappeared and the prosecution alleged that they were lovers. Both Sharon and Margaret Rudin deny ever having an affair.
“We weren't having an affair, because I was married. If I hadn't been, he wasn't my type,” said Margaret Rudin.


The prosecution told Sharon that he would be given total immunity if he were to testify against Margaret Rudin.
“They told him, ‘We're gonna charge you with the same murder that we're charging Margaret Rudin. However, if you flip, immunity will give you total immunity.’ Now what's up with that?” said Rudin’s friend Casell.
Judge Joseph Bonaventure said he was baffled as to why prosecutors would offer immunity to Sharon.
“How do you give a co-conspirator, which [the prosecution] thought he was, immunity and you don't know what he's gonna testify to?” said Bonaventure, speaking for the first time about the Rudin case.


Sharon did not reveal anything while on the stand. He denied having anything to do with Ron Rudin's murder and has never been charged in connection with the case.
“I know that I received immunity. From what? I have no idea,” he said at the trial.
Although Sharon’s testimony didn’t deliver for the prosecution, they secured testimony from Margaret Rudin’s sister, Dona Cantrell.
Under the advice of her attorney, Margaret Rudin remained silent during the trial.
“I feel like all of this became, at some point after that, an exaggeration and a witch hunt,” Rudin said.

Lovato also testified against Margaret Rudin. He repeated the story about finding blood in the bedroom and bathroom prior to the discovery of her husband’s remains. The state used his testimony to argue that Ron Rudin was killed in bed.
In addition, the defense argued that if Ron Rudin was murdered in the bedroom, the blood spatter would have indicated a different pattern. To prove this, they reconstructed the bedroom in the courtroom -- a decision that the judge said backfired.
“I sorta blew up on that. I said, ‘This is the most ridiculous thing.’ ... It was a circus,” said Bonaventure. “Twenty years later, I'm irked.”
Throughout the trial, the defense struggled to develop key arguments, like the timeline for Ron Rudin’s disappearance in connection to the closing of the Lee Canyon deal .
After over nine weeks, the prosecution and the defense finally rested what still is, to this day, the longest trial in Las Vegas history. Vest said the case seemed pretty open-and-shut.


“This thing was a slam dunk with a stepladder. I mean, it just was,” said Vest. “When you start adding up who had the means, motive, opportunity to do it, there's only one person and then we had the lone holdout.”
The holdout juror was Coreen Kovacs, who held Margaret Rudin’s innocence for six days of deliberation.
“There was no direct evidence against Margaret. There were no forensics, there was nothing,” said Kovacs. “Yes. I was the only not guilty vote … which caused a lot of fury in that jury room.”
Despite Kovacs’ hold, she eventually caved. On May 2, 2001, Vest read the verdict: the jury found Margaret Rudin guilty of murder in the first degree.
“I was surprised at that,” said Bonaventure.
Kovacs said that after the verdict was read, she immediately broke down in tears. She said she blames herself for what she believes was an injustice.


“I felt so bad about how things went down, and very ashamed of myself that I let that happen,” she said. “It was the biggest regret of my life. It really is.”
Margaret Rudin is sentenced to prison, refuses plea deals
Margaret Rudin was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 20 years served. Unknown to the jurors and many others in the courtroom, she had been offered multiple plea deals, which she refused.
“She didn't hesitate one bit, ‘Oh, no, Judge. I'm innocent. I'm not taking any deal. I can't plead to something I didn't do,’"" Bonaventure recalled.
Over the course of the next two decades, Rudin was given a total of five opportunities to make a plea deal in exchange for a lighter prison sentence.
“I never considered it. I'm not going to admit it. I don't care if I’m 110 and I'm still waiting. I'm not going to admit to something I didn't do,” she said.
Margaret Rudin said she adapted quickly to prison life and became a crusader for various prisoners’ rights and reforms.
“The only way you can bear a lot of the things is you have to only think about what's good still, what you have left still,” she said.


As the years went by, the lingering question of whether Margaret Rudin received a fair trial remained. Even behind bars, she never gave up trying to prove her innocence, filing an appeal to overturn her conviction, which was denied in 2002.
“In 42 years, that is the worst trial that I've ever had,” said Bonaventure.
He said he thinks about what would have happened to Margaret Rudin if he had allowed a mistrial at the beginning of the trial as requested by Margaret’s lead defense lawyer.
“It might have had a different outcome for Margaret Rudin,” he said.
In 2008, a judge for Margaret Rudin’s appeal granted her a new trial, but then the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the judge’s decision two years later. As of 2021, the case to grant her a new trial is still pending in federal jurisdiction.
“There is not one thing, not one thing that ties me to Ron's murder -- nothing forensic,” said Rudin. “DNA [analysis] was different than it is today. Bring it out. You've still gotta have the proof somewhere. Bring it out. Let's have it under DNA standards today.”

Margaret Rudin, released from prison, continues her fight for her innocence

On Jan. 10, 2020, Rudin was released from prison after serving 20 years of her life sentence. Coreen Kovacs, the holdout juror who befriended Margaret Rudin after her conviction, and Margaret Rudin’s attorney Mullanax were there to greet her.
“The world had changed, life had changed, my children had changed,” said Margaret Rudin.
Now 77 years old, she has moved back to the Chicago area, and is still determined to prove her innocence. Mullanax said he would represent Rudin if she is granted another trial.
“The physical evidence just doesn't add up. It's even a weak circumstantial case,” he said. “They didn't have a strong enough lead defense attorney to challenge all the evidence that was admitted at trial.”

Mullanax said the first hurdle is to get the federal judge to order a new trial before they dive into evidence that he hopes will exonerate Rudin.
“I just hope that the court in Las Vegas would order a new trial and that this matter could be settled. The chances, I don't know, it's up to the judge right now,” he said.
Former detective Peterson does not feel the same and said that he thought Rudin was guilty.
“I think because of the details of the murder, how heinous it was and because it was motivated by money, by greed, that personally, I think she should have stayed behind bars,” said Peterson.

Now a great-grandmother, Margaret Rudin spends time reflecting on the series of events that culminated into her life’s story.
“I don't understand how my trial, my life, my sitting here today, could be so different than the way I started my life out, with such opportunities,” Rudin said. “Now, if I had my life to live over again, I would stay right here in Illinois and never, ever have subjected my kids or myself to Vegas.”
Rudin said that despite all she’s faced, she will continue to fight to prove her innocence.
“I don't care what you think. God and I know I have a lotta supporters. I have a lotta friends. I have a lotta love,” she said. “Who wants to live a conventional life, right?”

975,CherryBlossom724,[],1632685237,"Dorothy Cooper (born in 1909) married Jules Forstein (born in 1906), city magistrate, in 1942. Jules had two children from his previous marriage (Myrna and Marcy) and his first wife Molly had died in childbirth in 1940. Dorothy and Jules went on to have a son together, whom they named Edward. Their marriage was said to be a happy one. And Dorothy herself was described as being a friendly and outgoing woman, with no known enemies.

On January 25, 1945, Dorothy left the children with a neighbor so she could go run errands. Later that evening she returned home and was brutally attacked by an unknown assailant. Her neighbor, Maria Townley, later claimed to have seen someone ""either walking with Mrs. Forstein or closely following behind"" as she walked towards her front door. However, Townley didn't think much of it at the time and it was only after learning about the attack that the significance of what she saw occurred to her.

During the attack, Dorothy knocked the telephone off of its base and the operator, alarmed at what she was hearing, called the police. Dorothy was found unconscious with a broken nose and jaw, a concussion, and a fractured shoulder. She never got a good look at her attacker. She told detectives that ""Someone jumped out at me. I couldn't see who it was. He just hit me and hit me."" Nothing was stolen and it appeared that her assailant had probably intended to kill her. 

Sadly, the previously outgoing and bubbly Dorothy was traumatized by this horrific incident and became a recluse from this point on. 

On the night of October 18th, 1949, Jules was away at a political banquet and his teenaged daughter Myrna was away visiting friends. Before Jules left his office to go to the banquet, he called Dorothy to check on her. According to Jules, Dorothy claimed that everything was fine and ended the call by telling him to ""Be sure to miss me!"". At around 9pm, Dorothy phoned a friend and made plans to go shopping the following day. They said that Dorothy had sounded normal on the phone.

Jules arrived home later that night (about 15 minutes after the abduction, according to Marcy) to find their two youngest children, Marcy and Edward, huddled together in their bedroom crying and saying ""Mommy's gone!"". Marcy explained that she had seen Dorothy lying on the floor in her bedroom and a strange man coming up the stairs. He was wearing a brown cap, a brown leather jacket, and she guessed that he was ""about as old as Daddy"". She had never seen him before. This man then picked her mother up and told Marcy ""Go back to sleep, little one. Your mother is all right."" He carried Dorothy downstairs and Marcy claimed to have heard a key turn in the lock... 

It's sometimes stated that Jules waited days to report his wife missing. However, we can be sure that this isn't true because the earliest article on her disappearance is dated October 19th, 1949, the day after her abduction. So clearly she was reported missing almost immediately. Strangely though, an early article on the case claims that detectives believed Dorothy to be a ""victim of amnesia"". Though why they believed this is unclear, as that point was never elaborated on. 

Also of note is the fact that once again nothing was stolen. There was no sign of a struggle in the bedroom and the bed covers were pulled back, suggesting that Dorothy had probably been in bed when this man first entered their home. Also, there was no sign of forced entry and no fingerprints were found. Dorothy was never seen or heard from again.

Other interesting details: Jules put up a $1,000 reward for information leading to Dorothy's whereabouts, but later withdrew it, because he needed the money for himself. Is this a hint that maybe he had been struggling financially even before her disappearance? That may or may not be relevant though.

Another interesting, but possibly irrelevant bit of information: When Jules died on January 1, 1956, he left an estate valued at $4906 to his three children. Dorothy's assets amounted to $9946 in securities found in her safe deposit box after her disappearance. I couldn't find much information about her family or her early life prior to marrying Jules, but I am curious where her money/securities came from and how much there had been at the time of her disappearance. 

Suspects:

* Jules Forstein. Naturally, the spouse/SO is typically the first suspect in cases like this and often with good reason. Though Jules had an ironclad alibi and was never seriously considered a suspect. I still lean more towards this theory as being the most plausible one, since he could have hired someone and given them a key (though, granted, the initial attack in 1945 didn't exactly seem like a professional job), but I also question why he would have waited 4 years between the first attack and the abduction to arrange something, if he really wanted rid of her that badly? Of course, this is assuming that the two incidents are related, but it seems incredibly likely that they are. Though Jules never remarried after Dorothy's disappearance, so we can rule that out as a motive.

* Morris Anmuth, a textile salesman. In September, 1944, Anmuth was pulled out of a crowd during a protest on charges of inciting to riot, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct. According to Anmuth, two officers beat him for 20 minutes. He was fined $10 and then filed an assault and battery charge against the officers, James McCarthy and Samuel Ralston. McCarthy and Ralston were initially held on $1,000 bail each by Magistrate James McBride. But these charges were later dropped by Magistrate *Jules Forstein*. Some believe that this might have provided a motive for Anmuth to want to hurt Dorothy, in order to punish Jules. 

* A stalker/jilted lover? This theory is interesting and makes sense, though there's nothing to suggest that Dorothy had ever had an affair. I suppose she may have had a stalker though or an ex who was angry that she had moved on. I still question the four year gap between the first attack and the abduction though. But maybe this person tried to move on with their life following the 1945 attack and was then later, for whatever reason, consumed by an obsession with Dorothy again?

Also, what was the kidnapper doing downstairs? If Dorothy was already on the floor in the her bedroom when Marcy saw the man coming upstairs, it strongly suggests that he had already been up there and had done something to her (drugged her, perhaps?). So why did he go back downstairs? Was he destroying evidence of some kind down there? Or was he looking for something? I find this case really fascinating and would love to hear what all of you think about it too.

976,Szabo84,[],1632670073,"There's not really a lot about this case online (actually I've only come across it on one site), and I have to admit I do lean towards what the police considered at the time and that it was an unfortunate accident (such incidents still occur today, and were not uncommon during the war years, only yesterday I read about a woman holidaying with her family in Blackpool during the war, when she was killed by a richocheting bullet from a plane during a military training exercise), but I do find it an interesting case nonetheless.

54-year-old railway checker Jack Owen left his home at about 7.30 p.m on June 21, 1944, .to go to his allotment, which was near to the LNER (London and North Eastern Railway) goods yard and owned by the company. A number of railwaymen had allotments there. At about 8.20 p.m. Jack's wife went to the allotment and found him lying on the ground in the corner of the foul pen (the foul pen had been damaged a few nights before by egg thieves and Jack had been fixing it).

When the police arrived they found Jack Owen had been shot in the neck (possibly from a distance away) and that neither the gun nor bullet could be found.

A post-mortem revealed he had been shot from the rear and that death had been practically instantaneous.

The police were interested in finding what type of gun had been used, and if anyone had heard any shooting nearby, but it's not reported whether their enquiries led to any success. 

Eight days later on June 29, it was reported that on the evening  Jack Owen was killed, a woman had been travelling on a train from Leicester to Nottingham when a bullet crashed through the window of her compartment. This occured around 6 p.m. No injuries were reported and again, if there were any follow-up enquiries made, it's unknown what they found.

Nottingham detectives described the case as 'a first-class mystery'.

The girl was topless but her bra and shirt were found nearby. The belt loops in her jeans had ripped suggesting she’d been dragged. 

Carolyn had been dead for about 2 weeks and animals had started to eat her, leaving her disfigured and impossible to identify . But the main kicker was one of her teeth had been prepared for a root canal a week earlier. 

With that, a waitress named Patty Wilkins  came forward and said she saw a blonde girl matching the description at a truck stop on January 4th. The girl she saw was travelling with a much older truck driver who she seemed comfortable with. The girl had even mentioned her root canal, and the staff gave her an aspirin. Aspirin had turned up in Carolyn’s autopsy. 

Other witnesses claimed to have seen or talked to her in some capacity. Carolyn told people she was living with a friend in Phoenix and planned to hitch her way to New Jersey.  

Although she was misidentified as the missing Melody Cutlip for a few years until Melody turned up alive, she was finally matched through DNA as Carolyn Eaton in 2021. 

Carolyn was a 17yo from Missouri. She was one of 6 sisters and ran away from home in December 1981 for unknown reasons. The case is ongoing.  What are your thoughts?

983,miracled2_777,[],1632609919,"&amp;#x200B;

Prison guard, member of Masonic organization, lived near phone booth Z called during his crimes, suspected of framing suspects, suspected of using some sort of glue to tape his big ears during all of his crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Read carefully! All explanations below for solution. \~I figured his name + his dad's middle name (who was also Mason) in Z13 with no anagramming\~

&amp;#x200B;

**A•E•N•Z•8•K•8•M•8•T•N•A•M**

&amp;#x200B;

**I•M•T•T•E•R•E•W•E•L•L•I•W**

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that **N** is perfectly put next to non letters symbols, both times, and both times form 2 different double letters with them, **TT** and **LL**.

&amp;#x200B;

All other signed letters goes 1 letter for another. Zodiac used different patterns when writing letters/ciphers **ECIDARAP-PARADICE.**

&amp;#x200B;

He did it with this section too in Z13. **IMTTEREWELLIW**

&amp;#x200B;

**IM** is read as is written, **IM** (think of how normally is word **WILL** written in **Z340**) But rest of message in **Z340**, how he wrote word **PARADICE (Z340)** ***backwards*** but **WILL (Z340)** ***normally***\*\*.\*\* You can think the same with this as word **WILL (Z340)=IM(Z13)**, normally written sequence of word.

&amp;#x200B;

And then we have this \~ **ECIDARAP (Z340) = TTEREWELLIW (Z13).**

&amp;#x200B;

Simple sequence obtained from **Z340**, one word written normally and next word to them reversed. Notice second row from below in Z340 in cleartext written words **WILL•EB**, **WILL-BE**, WILL is normally written, then, **EB-BE**, EB is reversed (*Was that hint from Zodiac pointing at Z13 how it must read?*) 

&amp;#x200B;

I think he used same trick for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Then finally, let's back what we have: **IM▪︎TTEREWELLIW▪︎** Now let's follow simple Z rules from cipher because he liked to write one word normally, WILL, then immediately after it reversed other, ECIDARAP (knowledge we got from Z340 in clear message) .

&amp;#x200B;

Now some words sound phonetically almost same, look at first 3 letters from Z13 before Z sign, **AEN = IM**. And then look at 3 last letters in Z13, where it says **NAM**, and It says word **WILL.**

&amp;#x200B;

Coincidence? It's up to you to believe. Finally, Z13 with no anagramming perfectly fit:

&amp;#x200B;

**IMTTEREWELLIW**

&amp;#x200B;

We fix **IM** in place and go backwards following cipher:

&amp;#x200B;

**TTEREWELLIW &gt; WILLEWERETT**

&amp;#x200B;

**IMWILLEWERETT**

&amp;#x200B;

**IM WILL EWERETT**

&amp;#x200B;

**Little trick he used: W-V (schizotypal thinking I guess, double V's form W)**

&amp;#x200B;

*Finally, we got:*

&amp;#x200B;

***IM WILL EVERETT***

&amp;#x200B;

Second thought: Z13 begins with **AEN** which would satisfy him for name **Andrew**)

&amp;#x200B;

And ending of the same **Z13: AM**, which would satisfy ending of name **William.**

&amp;#x200B;

And this is sensible of him to put this in Z13, because he did not reveal full details, example for it: McDuff or Andrew. He put his own name and his dad's middle name. That's it from me.

&amp;#x200B;

***Andrew William (Everett) McDuff***

&amp;#x200B;

Look at that face 6 years before *possibly* committing crimes in 1969:

984,JTigertail,[],1632604700,"Yesterday, u/ferrariguy1970 made a post here about how the NamUs page for Walker County Jane Doe, a teenaged girl found murdered in Texas in 1980, had been taken down.

Today, forensic artist Carl Koppelman (who has run the ""Who is Walker County Jane Doe?"" FaceBook page for years), made a Facebook post [announcing that she has been identified](https://imgur.com/PPsnR6I). Her name is temporarily being withheld to protect her family's privacy, but he did say that Walker County Jane Doe ""**did not** come from a dysfunctional family"" and that she **WAS** reported missing at the time of her disappearance. lt is thought that their report ""got lost in the jumble of missing children's cases.""

There is currently no information about how she was identified. It is unknown if this was a forensic genealogy case, if someone rediscovered the missing persons report and looked her up in NamUs, etc.

Our hearts go out to Walker County Jane Doe and her family during this difficult time. I am so sorry that this happened to her and that it took so long for her to get her name back, and I hope her killer is brought to justice soon.

\--

For those unfamiliar with the case, [here is a summary from The Doe Network](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/91uftx.html):

&gt;A truck driver passing by the Sam Houston National Forest found the victim's body, nude with the exception of a chain necklace with a rectangular pendant. She was lying face down, 20 feet from the shoulder of I-45 north, a half-mile south of FM 1696 exit, two miles north of Huntsville, Texas. High-heeled sandals were thrown in proximity to the body.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was determined she was likely killed during the early hours of the morning. She had been sexually assaulted with a blunt instrument, beaten, and strangled with pantyhose (which may not have belonged to her). She had a deep bite wound on her right shoulder. No semen was found on or in the victim's body.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the murder became known through media accounts, several people came forward and said they had seen a teenager matching her description the day before her body was found. It has not been verified that the girl was the unidentified victim; all witnesses have since died.  
&gt;  
&gt;A witness identified the victim as a girl who had been at the South End Gulf station around 6:30 PM on Halloween night asking for directions to the Ellis prison unit. She had been wearing blue jeans, a yellow pullover sweater with large pockets that hung below her waist, and she was carrying high-heeled sandals in her hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the best of his recollection, she had been let out of a 1973 or 1974 blue Chevrolet with a lighter colored top, possibly a Caprice, which was being driven by a white male. She looked disheveled like she had been traveling and perhaps sleeping in her clothes. She left the station, walking north on Sam Houston Avenue.  
&gt;  
&gt;A waitress working at the Hitchin' Post truck stop on Interstate 45 said the girl came into the restaurant the same evening and again, asked for directions to the Ellis Unit, saying she had a ""friend"" there. A map was drawn for her and she departed.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the waitress asked how old the female was, she responded that she was 19. The waitress thought that was an obvious lie and then asked the girl if her parents knew where she was. The young girl replied, ""who cares."" The waitress then asked her where she was from. The girl then mentioned the Aransas Pass or Rockport area.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her photograph was shown to every inmate at Ellis Prison Unit, but they all denied knowing who she was. The nature of her relationship to whom she planned to visit remains unknown, as to whether the individual was an inmate or an employee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Had the subject seen alive been the victim, it has been speculated that she was killed in a secluded area of the truck stop, after asking a trucker to allow her to sleep in the sleeper cab, as the prison would have been closed to visitors by the time she was seen for the last time.  
&gt;  
&gt;On January 16, 1981, the unidentified girl was buried in the Adickes Addition at Oakwood Cemetery after a funeral service was held.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Some speculation about whether her case was linked to other murders of young women in the area\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Her body was exhumed in 1999 and examined by a forensic anthropologist to obtain better information regarding her age and height, as well as to obtain a DNA sample, which was suitable only for a CODIS entry.  
&gt;  
&gt;The victim's height was confirmed to most likely be around 5'6"", and her age range was narrowed from the initial estimation of 15-22 to 14-18.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2015, the victim's case was reopened by police. A new facial approximation was released by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (replacing their previous rendering), which police described as accurately depicting the female's facial characteristics and hair color.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sandals found near her body were reportedly sent to be tested for the presence of DNA, although no additional details have been released. The necklace worn by the female was never photographed, and its current location is unknown.",Walker County Jane Doe has been identified
985,kevinsshoe,[],1632604317,"Since her NamUs page went down, there has been a lot of talk about WCJD being identified. I just wanted to share what the most recent info seems to be--Carl Koppelman, the forensic artist who's put special interest and effort into identifying Walker County Jane Doe, has posted this on his Who Was Walker County Jane Doe? Facebook Page:

""I just received a message from a friend of the family of the girl formerly known as Walker County Jane Doe.   

Walker County Jane Doe has been identified.   She was not from the state of Texas.    All of the persons about whom there has been speculation, including a girl shown in a photo that just surfaced today are not WCJD.

The family is obviously traumatized by the news, and has requested that I keep any specifics in confidence, and I am honoring that request.   

There are still many members of her family who have not received the news, and for the time being, they want to maintain a circle of privacy.   They have been following in recent days how much attention this case has attracted over the years, and need time to grieve before any information about her goes public.

Thank you all for your interest in this case, and thank you for your understanding.

Carl K""  


This is a huge moment for many of us who have followed this case... so many strangers have been effected by the circumstance and brutality of this young girl's death, and the years that have gone by without her or her killer being identified. Let's respect that her loved ones don't want names and further info public at the moment, and give them time to grieve while we wait to learn more--what's important is that she has her name back, not that we learn it.  


May she receive justice and peace.

986,TheGlitterMahdi,[],1632603820,"Anneliese Heinig was 37 on Thanksgiving Day, 2019, when she went missing in Richmond, Maine. Heinig was reported missing by her daughter when she did not show up for a family Thanksgiving dinner.

The investigation confirmed that Anneliese was last seen around 6:30 AM 2 days earlier on I-295, about 40 miles from Richmond, walking away from a Mercury Mariner that her parents had loaned her. The vehicle was impounded at the time, and inside were Anneliese's phone, wallet, keys, and birthday items for Anneliese's daughter, whose birthday had just passed. 

Police at the time did not suspect foul play. Anneliese had a history of mental illness, including PTSD, substance abuse, and a previous threat to die by suicide by jumping from a bridge.

The search for Anneliese at the time she went missing focused on the area around the Presumpscot River in Falmouth, Maine, near where her vehicle had been abandoned.

On September 12 of this year, a recreational kayaker on the Presumpscot River found partial human remains. A search of the area by police recovered further remains. On September 22, police confirmed to the media and public that these remains belonged to Anneliese Heinig. 

Anneliese leaves behind a large group of family and friends, including her parents and her two children.

987,ferrariguy1970,[],1632530325,"I saw some chatter on another site that Walker County Jane Doe's NamUs profile had come down, which usually happens when an unidentified person is named.  This has been an unresolved mystery for almost 41 years since she was found dead November 1, 1980.  I thought it was worth an update post.

I started working on this post and found out that her profile on the Texas DPS website has also been removed.

She was a murder victim found dead in Huntsville, Texas.  Cause of death was strangulation.   Her estimated age was determined to be 14-20 at the time of death but based on the postmortem photos, I am guessing she's in the younger age range.  She was lying face down in the grass approximately on the side of I-45.  

She was determined to be in good health with the medical examiner determining that she was from a middle-class background.  

After news of her death broke, several witnesses came forward who all said they encountered her in the area around 24 hours before her death.  These included the manager of a gas station and two employees at the Hitch 'n' Post truck stop, all of whom described this girl as wearing blue jeans, a dirty yellow pullover, and a white knit sweater with large pockets. This girl had been carrying red leather-strapped high heel sandals.

It was speculated she was searching for an inmate at a nearby prison.  Inmates and employees of the Ellis Prison Farm were shown mortuary photographs of the victim, and nobody could ID her.  Searches of nearby towns, including yearbooks, did not lead to any missing persons and since then she's been a Jane Doe.

Walker County Jane Doe was buried in the Adickes Addition at Oakwood Cemetery. Her burial followed an open casket funeral.   The cemetery in which she was buried is located within the town where her body was found. She is buried beneath a tombstone donated by Morris Memorials; the inscription upon her tombstone reads, ""Unknown white female. Died Nov. 1, 1980.""

She was exhumed in 1999 for a forensic examination, including DNA.  She's had a DNA profile in CODIS since then:  mtDNA available in CODIS. Ref #F-2713.

It would be amazing if this young lady got her name back before the 41st anniversary of her murder!  I hope they release the name.

990,thekingofwintre,[],1632495989,"(This is my first write-up, please be nice!)


Ängelholm is a small town (pop 28200 in late 2018) in southern Sweden. It is quite a safe town, but even more so in 2004. Criminal activity has since risen, but when this happened I was never afraid walking alone at night, I rarely locked the door to my house and hearing sirens was something that definitely didn't happen every week.

This idyllic town has nonetheless gained some fame for its unsolved disappearances. This particular one is personal to me. I didn't know Jimmy, but I met him about a month before he was never seen again. While attending a local music festival I found a striped knitted hat which I picked up and a few hours later a guy approached me saying it was his. I returned it to him and didn't think much of the encounter until a month later.


**Who was Jimmy?**

Jimmy Svensson was born in 1984 or 1985. At the time of his disappearance he was 20 years old and living primarily with his mother, **Eva**, who recently separated from his stepdad, **Ulf**. 

Jimmy had a solid friend group and a girlfriend. He was slender, approximately 170 cm tall and had dark blonde/light brown hair. The last time he was seen he was wearing his favorite multicolored striped knitted hat. 

**July 29th, 2004**

It's a regular Thursday morning and Jimmy has just started an antivirus check on his computer when he tells his mother Eva that he's going to run an errand. He's not expected to be gone a long time and he leaves his computer on. He leaves approximately $40 on his desk, together with his passport. His girlfriend has later stated that it was unusual for him to do so, remembering times when he forgot it at home and returned home to get it. Police have later confirmed that they through ""technical evidence"", most likely Jimmy's computer and/or online activity, can confirm that he was alive at 11 am that Thursday.

That's all we know. Everything after this ranges from ""not confirmed"" to pure speculation. I have tried to include everything I could find, but because this is an ongoing cold case investigation, Swedish law prohibits me from accessing the police records.

Jimmy's stepdad, Ulf, claims he met Jimmy a few hours after Jimmy left his mother's apartment when Jimmy appeared at Ulf's house complaining of a leak in his bike tire. Ulf claims he provided Jimmy with another bike, a black Monark, and Jimmy took off once again.

Withnesses say they saw Jimmy bike past a local cafe but I can't figure out if this is before or after he supposedly left Ulf. The police claim that this sighting is false and that the witnesses either got the date wrong, or that it wasn't Jimmy at all.

**July 30th, 2004**

Jimmy never returned home. His mom reports him missing and the police quite quickly come to the conclusion that he disappeared of his own free will, and probably committed suicide, something the family has always rejected. They say that Jimmy was happy, and questions why he would start an antivirus scan on his computer just to go kill himself. With the conclusion that no crime has been committed, the police don't use a lot of resources to find him. The family looks for him, and puts up ""missing person""-posters around town. 

**Weeks later**

There is not a single sign of Jimmy. There is also, curiously enough, no sign of the black Monark bike he borrowed from Ulf. The police now say they have ""new information"" and says that Jimmy's disappearance is now considered a murder investigation.

A small river/stream, Rönne Å, runs through the entirety of Ängelholm. It is a big part of the city centre and you need to cross it to get just about anywhere. For Jimmy to get from his mother's apartment to his stepdads, he must have crossed it twice. The police drag (sorry, I'm not sure if this is the right word in English) Rönne Å several times, but there is still no trace of Jimmy or his bike.

There has been no activity on Jimmy's phone or debit card since the 29th. 

When Ulf was questioned by the police regarding the bike Jimmy left with him, he claims he repainted it a few days after Jimmy's disappearance so no clues could be found on the bike.

Not a lot of other information has been confirmed by the police at this point. All I could find out through news articles is that cadaver dogs marked a spot a few kilometers outside of town but that nothing was found. They also confirmed that around 30 (!) phone calls were made between Ulf and an unidentified woman. If the large forum thread on Jimmy on a popular Swedish forum is to believed, this woman is Eva, Jimmy's mom, but those are unsubstantiated rumors and should be taken with a grain of salt. 

**Theories**

**Ulf?**

It's been 17 years now. I've mulled this over in my head so many times, and if we assume that Jimmy **didn't** commit suicide, the most logical explanation (to me) would be that he was murdered by Ulf. 

* No one can confirm that Jimmy met Ulf that day, or what their conversation was about.
* Ulf and Eva were separated. He had, according to Jimmy's girlfriend, previously threatened suicide over the separation. Some people that **claim** they knew Jimmy, and his girlfriend, has said that Ulf was a heavy drinker.
* He **repainted** Jimmy's bike right after Jimmy disappeared. 
* No one who claims they knew Jimmy and his family have nice things to say about Ulf in the previously mentioned forum thread. 

What I can't figure out is how, and why. Ulf's neighborhood (known to inhabitants as ""Papegojan"") **only** has pedestrian access. The roads are narrow and the houses (mostly two story apartments or duplexes) are close together. None of the apartments have, as far as I know, garages or sheds connected to the buildings. It would be damn near impossible to move a body around here, especially during the day, and the address where Ulf lived is several hundred meters from a parking lot. 

**Suicide?**

While this is certainly plausible, as it always is in these cases, where the hell is Jimmy? Where is his  bike? Ängelholm is surrounded a forest planted in the 1700's to keep the sand from the beach from drowning the city, but it is filled with trails and there's honestly not a lot of places to hide your body.

For those that are a little more unfamiliar with photography, this is an absolutely massive  and ultra complicated lens as it not only is an ultra telephoto lens with a huge range, but also lets in an absolutely insane amount of light. One of the weirder aspects of this particular lens is its apparent age; Joel's colleague and many other photographers agree that the lens would have been made in the 1970s based on the lettering of the Canon logo and the lens' construction. However, no modern equivalents to this lens exist or are in production today.    


It's worth noting that Canon apparently is not aware of the production of this lens, despite this lens having a serial number of 80001.  


It's also unlikely that any professional photographer would have used such a lens as the lens is extremely heavy and would be astronomically difficult to focus by hand. The seller claims that it was custom built for photo finishes at sporting events, however the lens appears to be way too long in focal length for this application.   


Some in the threads speculate that this is actually a lens that was used for military aerial surveillance, nuclear test monitoring or even simply for some unknown industrial application. Really intriguing to think about this lens being used for night time aerial surveillance, as it has the right focal length and aperture for this kind of application.","One for the photographers on this sub. No one, including Canon themselves, seems to be able to identify this vintage Canon lens. What was it used for, and why would anyone need such a massive and ultra specialised piece of equipment?"

# Overview

In the night from October 25th to 26th 1984 the unemployed food technician Günther Stoll behaves strangely: he is feeling followed, writes a mysterious note (the name giving YOG’TZE note), passes out in a pub (before drinking anything), visits a neighbor of his parents in the middle of the night and makes “predictions” of impending doom.

Later that night he is found seriously injured on the passenger seat of his crashed car, completely naked, and over 100 km away from the point he was last seen. His last words before dying are about four men that were with him in the car and were not his friends.

Autopsy found out that he was overrun by a different car while he was already naked and that he had neither alcohol nor drugs in his blood. Till today there are no leads to what really happened during this night or why Günther was killed.

# Background

Günther Stoll was a 34-year-old, unemployed food technician. He was married and the couple had a daughter.

They were living in the small village of Anzhausen (slightly above 1000 inhabitants then) in the state North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was born in the small village Haigerseelbach, around 15 km away in the state of Hesse. His mother was still living there.

Günther drove a blue, three-door VW Golf.

Acc. to his wife, he often seemed anxious and afraid in the weeks leading up to his death. But he could or would not explain what was the cause for this.

# His last evening

On Thursday, October 25th 1984, between 8 and 9 pm, Günther has diner with his wife. During the meal he mentions that everybody is against him and that “they” want to do him harm. As before he cannot or does not want to elaborate who “they” are.

Shortly before 11 pm he exclaims that, now he begins to see (“Nun geht mir ein Licht auf!”). He writes the (in-)famous six characters YOG’TZE (or YO6’TZE, I will come to this later…) on a sheet of paper and immediately crosses them out again. He leaves the sheet of paper behind and tells his wife that he will go to the pub to have a beer.

Only a few minutes later he arrives in the pub “Papillion” in the neighboring village Wilnsdorf, which is only around 5 km away from his home. He is an occasional customer and known by the people present. He orders a beer. Before the beer is served, he loses consciousness for a moment and falls from his chair. He suffers a small injury in the face but is back up almost instantly. When asked, if he is drunk, he says that he had not any alcohol. He leaves the pub without touching his beer and drives away in his car.

About two hours later, around 1 am he rings the bell of Erna Helfitz (this seems to by a pseudonym made up by police to protect the identity of the real person), an old woman in Haigerseelbach, the village where he was raised and his mother and his sibling are still living. Haigerseelbach is only 10 km from the pub and it is unknown what he did in the two hours between the two sightings. He knows the woman from his childhood and she only lives a couple of houses away from his mother.

As it is in the middle of the night Erna only opens a first-floor window and talks with Günther from there. He wants to come in and discuss something with her and predicts that “something terrible will happen this night”. She declines because it is in the middle of the night. She suggests that he should go to his mother if he has problems. He answers that she will not understand. Erna then suggests that he drives home to his wife to which he agrees and leaves.

We again skip two hours and move 100 km north on the highway A45. The truck driver Holger Meffert is driving his truck from Frankfurt to Dortmund. Shortly before the exit “Hagen-Süd” he notices a blue VW Golf in the trench beside the highway. He also sees a man in light colored clothing outside of the car. He seems to be injured and bleeding on his right arm. He stops to render assistance. As he first has to slow down, he stops around 200 meters after the crashed car. As he happens to be near an emergency call box, he calls for help before going back to the crash.

In the meantime, a second truck driver, Georg Konzler, also notices the crash and stops. He will later state that he also saw an injured man outside of the car.

When they arrive at the crashed Golf, they cannot find the person they have seen walking around the car. But they find the naked and seriously injured (almost amputated arm, etc.) Günther Stoll in the passenger seat of his own car. When they ask him, where the other person did go, he answers that there were four men in the car (Unclear if this includes him or not. Also notice that the Golf was a three-door and therefore all passengers from the backseat would need to exit via the driver door.) and that the men were not his friends. After that he loses consciousness and dies on the way to the hospital.

# Investigation

Autopsy showed that Günther was injured by being driven over with a car. Not his own car, but another one. Also, it was determined that this first crash did not happen at the same place as the second crash, where he was finally found. The strangest thing the autopsy found: he was already naked when he was driven over. Blood analysis showed that he had no blood alcohol and was not under the influence of drugs.

As for Günther’s car: the keys were found on the rear shelf. Günther’s shoes were found in the footwell of the driver seat. His clothing was either not found at all or found on the backseat (sources disagree on this one). Acc. to one source the accident of the Golf was staged by manually pushing the car off the highway (which I do not believe, when I see the pictures of how far the car went into the bushes).

As the police did not know, where the original crime scene was, they had to focus on Günther himself. They found two leads that eventually did not lead anywhere:

In the same year Günther made several trips to the Netherlands. It seems that there he had contact with some people that were into drugs. Although, there was no indication that Günther had to do anything with drugs, that was an investigative lead. It seems this was a dead end, as it was never mentioned again by the police.

The other lead is the (in-)famous note he scribbled and crossed out before he left his wife. Acc. to his wife the note read “YOG’TZE” or “YO6’TZE”. And here we have the main problem, I have with this note. Nobody but his wife has ever seen the note. She had already trashed it and when she remembered it, it could no longer be recovered. So, it is possible that she just misremembered or misread the note. She explicitly stated that she was not sure if the third character was a G or a 6. Could there be other unclear characters? Was it all there was or only the only “word” she remembered or could read? Please, also note, that therefore all pictures of the note circulating the internet are only “reproductions” (and most of the time not even crossed out, which should give them away instantly).

As the police could not find any leads, they addressed the public in the crime show “Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst” (meaning as much as “file number xy unsolved”) on April 12th 1985 in the search of hints. They especially asked if someone knew where Günther had been in the time slots between 11 pm - 1 am and 1 am - 3 am, if someone knows anything about connections to drugs and the meaning of YOG’TZE or YO6’TZE.

The police received several answers that YO6TZE is the call sign of a Romanian amateur radio station. But this led to no results.

Several Witnesses claimed that shortly after 3 am a person tried to tramp on the exit “Hagen-Süd” heading south (so the other direction as the car crash). Police thinks that this might be the same person that was seen by the two truck drivers outside of the crashed Golf. But this person could never be identified.

As there were no new leads the case became a cold case. In 2016 it was reopened again to perform DNA testing on the stored evidence. It is not really clear what came out of it, I found two contradictory statements. One article from 2017 states that no new DNA traces could be found, while another article from 2018 states that in the 2016 analysis new DNA was found, but cannot be attributed to anyone in the databases. 

# Theories

This case is so strange that you can up with a lot of theories. But basically, they condense down to two: either Günther was followed, he had a big secret and was killed or not.

Also, if it is a bit anticlimactic, I think the most likely theory is that Günther had a psychological episode. Nobody was following him. The YOGTZE was just a meaningless scribble. After the pub he just drove around aimlessly till he ended up in his home town. There he did not really know what he was talking. After that he drove around aimlessly again, till he stopped somewhere and undressed. After that he was hit in an accident. The driver and passengers of the other car wanted to cover up that accident (Maybe the driver was drunk?), placed Günther in his own car and at least one of them drove it away on the A45. Near Hagen-Süd something happened in Günther’s car. Maybe he regained consciousness and tried to intervene with the steering wheel? Therefore, the car crashed. The driver then fled the second crash and tried to tramp back.

All other theories more or less assume that Günther was really followed and involved in something dubious. So, maybe the whole story was a botched kidnapping attempt or a drug deal gone wrong? Others theorize that he knew about some big secret of the food industry that “they” tried to cover up…

As for the meaning of YOG’TZE, beside the radio stations there are multiple even more unlikely theories, what this could mean. Naming a few I have read:

· An anagram for zygote, meaning a fertilized egg.

· The note was upside down and should be read as a number, maybe 327,901

· YOG could be a short form of yogurt (which maybe was related to his former work) and TZE maybe some ingredient or process

What do you think? Has YOG’TZE any meaning? Was Günther followed? Where there really four other men in Günther’s car?

There are not many original sources for this case, that I could find. Most of them seem to have just copied from the segment of the Aktenzeichen XY TV show.

993,ExDota2Player,[],1632437892,"The legend states that while employed as a janitor at FritoLay, Montañez mustered up the courage to phone the CEO to present him a new spicy snack that he invented at home, the CEO of FritoLay took him on his word, flew out to the janitors plant to view the quirky presentation, and ultimately this allowed Mr. M to become an executive in the company.

Mr. M has been sharing this story for years without being challenged by any entity until recently when LA Times reporters deeply investigated his claims, releasing their article titled: “The Man Who Didn’t Invent Hot Cheetos”. The main challenger of his story is a former female employee who claims she actually invented the Hot Cheeto name and worked on the real project at Frito-Lay and claims Mr. M was never involved at all. 

But if Montañez was in fact a complete nutjob, why has he never been exposed by FritoLay or pursued legally for making false claims on the brand? The spicy snack was created around 30 years ago, depending on who you ask, so perhaps some records have been lost to time. And interestingly, Mr. M recently posted what he claims to be an original Bag design to his TikTok account, autographed and all. 

PepsiCo did verify that Mr Montañez actually worked at Frito-Lay for several years and there are a few employees who believe his story. Mr. M is now retired and works as a motivational speaker, reciting his Cheeto story across the globe and online, preaching work ethic and positivity. There’s a lot of detail I left out of this mystery but a good place to start is hearing his timeline of the story on YouTube where he claims he solely made the snack popular. He’s also now using his Cheeto fame to be involved in a Biopic movie about his life, directed by Eva Longoria.

But on Sept. 17, 2021, another Idaho bowhunter was looking for a shortcut from one hunting area to another when he came across a set of human remains and called the Lemhi County Sheriff’s Office to report the discovery. Since daylight was running out and the terrain was very rugged, the search resumed on the next day. The remains were found in the same area where Raymond Jones was last seen. 

Sheriff’s deputies found part of Jones’ wallet, with his identification still inside. Jones’ family members are still alive and have been contacted, according to Sheriff Steve Penner.

While there were other hunters in Jones' hunting part, he had gone out hunting on his own when he disappeared. 

A search for Jones was launched the day after Jones disappeared which including more than 70 people. A helicopter was also hired by Jones' family to assist in the search. Efforts were temporarily called off because of severe weather but later resumed after footprints were discovered on a nearby ridge. However, the search was ultimately unsuccessful, leaving Jones’ body unfound until more than half a century later.

996,dodli,[],1632423593,"&gt; Montgomery County Sheriff Chris Watkins is still actively investigating a 10-year-old unsolved homicide.

&gt; On Aug. 25, 2005, Teresa Carol Richardson, was murdered in her home at 122 Bluebird Drive, New London. She lived alone in Badin Shores Resort, a gated community in a quiet section of Montgomery County.

&gt; Watkins said the case was never closed on Richardson’s murder and the sheriff’s office has followed every new lead over the years.

&gt; “There has been an enormous amount of effort and technology dedicated to this investigation by the agencies involved over the past 10 years,” Watkins said. “This is not or will ever be a closed case until Richardson’s killer has been identified. However, over nearly a decade, clues and tips diminish and we are asking for help from the community.”

&gt; Richardson’s body was found about 10 a.m. on Aug. 25 in her basement office. She had been stabbed and cut 16 times in the head, neck, back and arm with a sharp object.

&gt; She had last been seen about 8 p.m. riding around Badin Shores on her golf cart and had called a friend about 9:45 p.m. That was the last time anyone heard from her.

&gt; The friends she usually met for breakfast became concerned when she didn’t show up and they couldn’t contact her. They went by her house to check on her and found the body.

&gt; Former Sheriff Jeff Jordan called it “a vicious homicide and home invasion” and said burglary was the reason for the break-in. Speculation was that the assailant or assailants came to Richardson’s lakeside residence by boat.

&gt; Richardson was employed as the administrative manager of the Badin Shores Resort Homeowners’ Association was involved in a legal dispute concerning her employment contract at the time of her death.

&gt; Then Sheriff Jordan and District Attorney Garland Yates asked the N.C. State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) to handle the death investigation because of the nature of the crime and because of the lawsuit. A Montgomery County deputy was a member of the homeowners’ association board of directors.

&gt; In 2009, Richardson’s case was listed as unsolved but still active by the SBI. That statement said numerous people had been interviewed and 75 swab samples eliminated family, known boyfriends and others. Latent print evidence submitted to the SBI crime lab resulted in no matches to possible suspects’ prints recovered at the scene.

&gt; Watkins is asking for anyone who has any information that could be helpful to reach out to the sheriff’s office or the SBI.

&gt; “The information you may have could be the key to helping solve this case,” Watkins said.

From the [news article](https://abc7.com/son-father-arrested-in-east-la-in-connection-with-3-cold-case-murders/11040736/):

&gt; A man and his father were arrested early Thursday morning at a home in East Los Angeles in connection with three separate murders that date back as far as 2014, authorities said.   
&gt;  
&gt;A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department SWAT team descended on a residence about 4:30 a.m. and took Anthony Velasquez, 31, into custody. His father, 51-year-old Manuel Velasquez, was arrested as a suspected accessory to the crimes.   
&gt;  
&gt;News video from the scene showed deputies placing a shirtless Anthony Velasquez into a patrol vehicle after he was apprehended.   
&gt;  
&gt;The arrests came after an $80,000 reward was offered in the case and investigators received multiple tips. 

Background on the cases and the victims from the [LA Sheriff's Department](https://lasd.org/centralized-la-sheriffs-homicide-bureau-connects-3-east-la-unsolved-murders-2-persons-of-interest-sought/):

&gt; On Wednesday, August 18, 2021, Homicide Bureau detectives announced an $80,000 reward in exchange for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects responsible for the murders of 34 year-old Jesse Avalos, 38 year-old Eduardo Robles and 27 year-old Amanda “Nikki” Lopez, who were killed in East Los Angeles in 2014, 2015 and 2018, respectively. The reward was sponsored by Supervisor Hilda Solis, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, First District. 

*  On Monday, February 10, 2014, at approximately 10:50 p.m., Victim Jesse Avalos received a phone call from an acquaintance requesting a jumpstart to his vehicle near the intersection of Telegraph Road and Arizona Avenue in East Los Angeles. Victim Avalos provided the jumpstart approximately 15 minutes later. A few hours later, East Los Angeles Sheriff’s Station received a phone call at 3:25 a.m. of an injured person at the 4800 block of Telegraph Road in East Los Angeles. There, deputies found Victim Avalos on the driver’s seat of his blue SUV.  He had sustained numerous gunshot wounds. The hood of his SUV was found open and two suspects were seen around the vehicle.
* On Monday, July 6, 2015, victim Eduardo Robles was involved in a physical altercation on the driveway of a residence on the 4300 block of Eagle Street in East Los Angeles. Victim Robles was visiting, and approximately 15 people were present when the incident occurred. After the fight, the suspect jumped over a wrought iron fence to the street, walked to Victim Robles’ vehicle and punctured the four tires with a sharp object and fled the location. The same suspect returned to the location five minutes later and shot Victim Robles several times in the upper torso. The suspect was picked up by a Hispanic male in his mid to late forties, five feet eight to five feet nine inches tall, heavy set build, in a light green colored vehicle. 
*  On Sunday, April 22, 2018, at approximately 2:40 a.m., the suspect exited the passenger side of a silver PT Cruiser and began searching for Amanda “Nikki” Lopez in a homeless encampment that was situated in a courtyard in front of the East Los Angeles Courthouse. The suspect located Victim Lopez in a tent in front of the field office of First District Supervisor Hilda Solis. The suspect placed a firearm into the tent and fired at Victim Lopez while she slept, striking her in the upper torso, killing her.     


&gt; Sheriff’s detectives made a plea to the public, hoping $80,000 will motivate someone to bring that missing piece of the puzzle and bring closure to these families. “We know there were witnesses at every murder,” said Homicide Bureau Captain Joe Mendoza. It was witnesses coupled with surveillance at scenes that allowed a good description of both suspects.  
&gt;  
&gt;But what led sheriff’s investigators to explore a possible connection in these three murders? Captain Mendoza explained, “One of the things that’s unique about LA County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau is that we are centralized and we commonly speak to other investigators about our cases.  So when investigators were comparing notes on cases, they believed they had similar description of the suspects and that’s when they really started to connect the dots. The link was the descriptions of the suspects who were similarly described.”  
&gt;  
&gt;When the ballistic evidence from the 2014 murder of Victim Avalos was compared to the ballistic evidence from the 2015 murder of Victim Robles, the comparison determined the same handgun was used in both murders.  
&gt;  
&gt;All three murders occurred within 2.2 miles of each other and within the same general area of East Los Angeles.  Although a motive for the murders was unclear, investigators believe the victims were known to the suspects and were specifically targeted based on their relationships with the suspects.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the three cases, witnesses describe the main suspect as a Hispanic male with short hair in his late twenties, five feet eight inches tall with a medium build. He has a tattoo on his neck with unknown writing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The second suspect drives the getaway vehicle and is described as a Hispanic male in his mid to late forties, five feet eight to five feet nine inches tall, heavy set build and possibly with a mustache.

Hopefully, the arrests of these men will bring some peace to the families and loved ones of their victims who've been waiting for justice.

DNA and forensic geneaology give another victim back her name:

The article above is concise enough that a summary would just be rewording it, so her you go:

""Authorities on Tuesday identified skeletal remains found nearly 44 years ago at a Mississippi construction site as Clara Birdlong, a woman they believe was a victim of the late Samuel Little, the most prolific killer in U.S. history.

In December 1977, hunters found her remains near a highway in Jackson County, the sheriff's department said. Birdlong, long identified by investigators as 'Escatawpa Jane Doe' was a short Black woman with a distinctive front gold tooth who was discovered about three to four months after she was killed, according to the Jackson County Sheriff's Department.

Since she was discovered more than four decades ago, authorities said ""several facial reconstructions and computer composites were created in an effort to help identify her. A breakthrough came after Mississippi authorities contracted a Texas DNA research facility, which traced Birdlong to a cousin in Mississippi. That relative connected investigators to her 93-year-old grandmother.

Another cousin told investigators in January that Birdlong, of Leflore county, was born in 1933 and went missing around the 1970s. And in August, a woman who remembered Birdlong told authorities the victim 'left Leflore County in the 70's with an African man who claimed to be passing through Mississippi on his way to Florida.'

'Clara was never seen or heard from again,' the sheriff's department said.

Little, who was serving multiple life sentences in prison before he died in late December at age 80, confessed to killing 93 women across the country between 1970 and 2005, including 'Escatawpa Jane Doe,' whom he did not know by name, according to authorities.

'Investigators confirmed Samuel Little was in Jackson County in 1977, during the approximate time frame of the woman’s death,' the sheriff's department said.

The agency added: 'Investigators eventually learned Samuel Little was arrested in Pascagoula in August of 1977 for petit theft. Although he is now deceased, Samuel Little is considered a prime suspect in the death of Clara Birdlong.' 

Her cause of death was undetermined.""

999,DJHJR86,[],1632401947,"Last week's Unsolved Mysteries podcast [episode](https://unsolved.com/podcasts/who-killed-kia/) covered the brutal 2016 murder of [Markia Benson](https://www.phillyvoice.com/upper-darby-police-still-searching-markia-bensons-killer/).  Markia lived [alone](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/markia-benson-bathtub-homicide/10798/) in an apartment complex in Secane, PA.  When she didn't show up for work on March 30th, her boyfriend and a coworker showed up at her apartment at around 4:00 p.m.  The front door was locked, as well as a sliding door, so the boyfriend and coworker went to the leasing office to get a key.  The boyfriend, coworker, and two apartment workers go in to the apartment and find everything in disarray.  The boyfriend hears running water and goes into the bathroom to find Markia in her bathtub, naked and lying on her back.  Hot water had been running all day so her skin was scalded.  The medical examiner concluded that her death was the result of ""blunt and sharp force injuries to the head and neck complicated by immersion and extensive scald burns.""

The police were able to determine that Markia was killed in her bedroom, and then dragged to the bathroom and placed in the tub.  From the Philly Voice article:

&gt; “The homicide scene was indicative of somebody who was really, really angry,” Chitwood said. “This was personal. We believe it was a crime of passion and hatred. There were [derogatory] messages written on the wall.”

&gt; The superintendent declined to divulge the specific words.

&gt; “It was a vicious fight,” Chitwood said. “There was blood on the walls and feces on the floor. He beat her and killed her and dragged her into the bathroom. It looks like she fought for her life and lost.""

&gt; He continued, “This was a brutal, sadistic killing because of the messages, the body and the crime scene. It’s tragic.”

The UM podcast has more information that hasn't been shared online about this case.

* The boyfriend was ruled out as a suspect and had an airtight alibi.

* The message scrawled on the walls was described by a detective as one ""derogatory"" word used to describe a female written three times over.

* A neighbor that Markia described to her family as ""creepy"" was checked out and he too was ruled out as a suspect.

* The police believe Markia knew who murdered her, because there were no signs of a struggle.

* Markia's passport was deliberately destroyed, and her killer trashed the apartment after the murder.

* The **main** suspect in the case, and one who the detective made very clear was *the* prime suspect, was an ex-boyfriend who Markia dated from 2009-2013. They had recently started communicating again, and Markia's family described him as abusive both physically and emotionally. He has no alibi from 7:30 p.m. the night prior to Markia's murder to about 9:30 a.m. on the morning of her murder. The police theorize that she was murdered as she was getting ready for work (IIRC her shift started at 9:00 a.m.).

Even though the police initially believed she fought for her life, after comparing the blood spatter evidence (which was only found in her bedroom), to the way the rest of the apartment was trashed, they now believe that she was surprised by her killer.  From a detective interviewed for the UM podcast:

&gt; We believe she was murdered in the early morning hours, based on the steam and the temperature in the apartment. There's a chance this person came there while she was getting ready for work. She allowed them in, and then the attack happened. She could have been awake and up, but forced onto the bed where she was assaulted. **But either way, we believe it to be a surprise attack because she, we believe, she would have fought and someone would’ve heard it.**

&gt; There's blood on her pillow, and on the mattress, and on the wall. First, we did some blood spatter analysis which determined the attack took place in and around the bed. **There was not a major sign of struggle. There was no lamps knocked over, nothing that suggested a knockdown, drag out fight.** Her fingernails, at the time, were not that long, so there wasn't a guarantee that the person would have been scratched during a struggle. And then, she was more than likely unconscious and dragged out of her bedroom and into the bathroom, which is just the next door out of the bedroom so it's not a far distance, and she was placed in the tub, and then the killer turned on the shower which was determined to be only hot water, so there was scalding hot water turned on her while she was in the tub and left running until she was discovered later that day.

Despite the police believing that the ex-boyfriend is the prime suspect, they have yet to link him forensically to the crime.  His alibi, while shaky, is not a ""smoking gun"" in terms of inconsistency.  From the podcast:

&gt;  He said that they had an argument over the phone on Saturday the 26th about not hanging out and him being distant. They then said that they were going to hang out on Tuesday the 29th. He's unable to provide any details about where he is on
the 29th, but he does say that he texted her at 6:30 on the 29th saying that he was tied up and they, he couldn't hang out. **He can tell us on the 30th, the day of the murder, that at 1:30, he goes to a local restaurant, and he can tell us exactly what he ordered. He says he drove around and ate his lunch, he just drove around aimlessly. That evening, he goes to another local restaurant sits at the bar and has a couple glasses of wine. Both of those were confirmed through, uh, surveillance video that he was in those places.**

&gt; There were some text messages on Tuesday the 29th at 7:28pm. He did text her indicating that he couldn't hang out with her. **And then there's no activity on his phone for several hours after that, until the late morning of the 30th, when Markia was killed. On the 30th, he left her four voicemails. One at 1:18pm, another at 5:29pm, 6:03pm and 10:13pm. All growing increasingly angry, like, “Why won't you answer the phone? Why are you doing this?” Almost staging the voicemails as if he thought that she would respond.**

Despite this, and also the ex-boyfriend failing a polygraph, the police still do not have enough to make an arrest.",Who Killed Markia Benson?

Christopher Danny Myles was born on September 30th in 1962.  He was the youngest of three children and a native of Fresno, California.  He went to Caruthers high school.

Danny loved history and reenactments that he used to take part in, especially about the civil war; he was a corporal of the Confederate Cavalry Regiment of the Civil War Association. 

With his sister Marita, they worked in a grape vineyard, where they used to cut grapes in order to afford to buy their school clothes.

He was last seen alive on Sunday, June 3rd 1979, between 10-11 pm.  Then on Monday the next day, his body was found in a vineyard badly beaten, sexually assaulted and shot twice in the head with a small calibre weapon.  He fought very hard with his assaulter and police found plenty of DNA.

He was so badly beaten that Danny was unrecognizable. He was identified from a tattoo that he had.  He was laid to rest on his brother’s birthday.

In 2004, Marita Myles spoke with the police and they said they were going to test the foreign DNA found at the crime scene.  There are no news updates about the outcome of this testing though.

Throughout the years, Marita had disagreements with the police department handling her brother’s case.

She wrote a poem about her brother which you can find in the video below:

### In the morning of May 24th, 2004, 53-year old Al Kite failed to show up for work. Later that day, investigators would search his house... and found the remains of Al in his own basement. He had been brutally and methodically murdered by an unknown assailant... who had likely posed as a potential roommate the week before.

**Short Backstory:**

On the morning of May 24th, 2004, an engineering consulting firm in Denver, Colorado named Carter-Douglas noticed the absence of an employee. The employee, a man named ""Al"" Kite, was a warm and friendly guy, who was normally a beacon of responsibility. He was rarely late, let alone without prior warning. 

When minutes began to turn into hours, the co-workers of Al began to grow worried. They decided to give Al's home and cell phone a shot, hoping he'd pick up and explain his absence on this Monday morning. Multiple calls yielded no results, and the office finally decided to phone Al's emergency contact. 

His emergency contact was his sister, Barbara - who lived thousands of miles away, in Virginia. Barbara answered the call, but insisted that she had not heard from Al or anyone else that morning. So she began trying to contact her younger brother, trying to reach the same phone numbers the office had tried beforehand. 

So, in desperation, Barbara turned to the one resource she had: the police. She knew that this absence was very unlike Al, so she got in-touch with the Aurora Police Department to pay her brother a visit and perform a welfare check.

Later, that afternoon, Aurora Police responded to Al Kite's residence. It was a residential townhouse, which didn't looked too abnormal. They knocked at the door multiple times, which earned them no response. Fearing that Al may be in some kind of danger, officers made the decision to enter the home. 

Inside, these police officers would find things to be pretty normal. Things looked where they should be, with some notable exceptions, but they continued their search of the home into the upstairs bedrooms, before deciding to head down to the basement. 

There, these officers would make a horrifying discovery unlike any other.

This is the story of Oakey ""Al"" Kite.

**The Murder:**

It was two days later - Monday, May 24th - that Al's absence was noted at work. 

His employer then contacted his sister, who got in-touch with Aurora P.D., and arranged for a welfare check to be performed on Oakey ""Al"" Kite. 

Police entered the home, after receiving no response to their repeated knocking attempts. They performed a cursory glance around the home, and then began stepping into the basement - where Al's mysterious new roommate was going to be moving any day now. 

Down in the basement, these responding officers found the body of Al Kite lying facedown, in a crime scene that looked incredibly gruesome from the get-go. There was blood spatter located along the wall and the floor around his body, indicating that his death had not been a peaceful one. 

Detective Thomas Sobieski, of the Aurora Police Department, responded to the call and would become one of the lead investigators for the case. He later described the crime scene as ""the worst \[he'd\] ever seen.""

Investigators and analysts noted a wound on the back of Al's head, which indicated that he had been hit from behind; most likely, they theorized, this had happened when he was walking down the basement steps. 

Most disturbing, though, was the realization that this poor man had not died painlessly, or even quickly. Police soon discovered that Al's had been bound with a cord; not only his hands, behind his back, but his feet as well - which were tied to his wrist ligatures. He had, in essence, been hog-tied. And from there, the person that had attacked Al Kite had proceeded to mercilessly torture Al for hours, at the very least, using a number of sharp instruments to do so.

Based on the information that investigators could surmise from the gruesome scene, they theorized that when relief came for Al Kite, it came in the form of twenty-two stab wounds. He appeared to have died just hours after speaking to his girlfriend, Linda, on the evening of Saturday, May 22nd, 2004.","The random, brutal and calculated torture and killing of Oakey ""Al"" Kite"
1002,Arseofthepig,[],1632370860,"Welcome back to another unsolved murder from Suffolk, the bottom half of the pigs arse (for a brief explanation if you didn't read my previous post: the UK looks like a lady riding a pig, Scotland is her head and hair, Wales the pigs head etc, East Anglia (Suffolk and Norfolk) is very much shaped liked the pigs arse). 

As mentioned previously, Suffolk is easily accessible from London, and Suffolk's second oldest unsolved murder which is still being reviewed by Suffolk and Norfolk Constabulary goes to show this.

In 1967, Bernard Oliver was a 17 year old warehouse worker, living in Muswell Hill, London, with his father and five siblings. On the evening of the 6th January, Bernard left his home to spend the evening with friends. He didn't return home that night, and his father reported him missing the next morning.

On the 16th January, a farm worker called Fred Burggy found two abandoned suitcases behind a hedge in Tattingstone, Suffolk (roughly 80 miles away from Muswell Hill). Upon opening the suitcases, Bernard's body was found inside. It had been cut into eight pieces. 

The post-mortem revealed that Bernard has been killed via strangulation prior to being dissected, around 48 hours before the discovery of his body. He had also been sexually assaulted.

Not only was this case notorious as one of the most brutal murders in Suffolk, it gained infamy for another reason. The police had no idea who the victim was, so they had photos of Bernard' decapitated head published in the press… which is how his family discovered what had happened to him. 

After his family came forward, more details about Bernard emerged. His brother Tony (13 at the time of the murder) who shared a room with him stated that Bernard often talked of moving out, and occasionally spent the night at friends houses but had always returned. Bernard had also been sighted in and around the Muswell area after his disappearance, but the people who saw him were unaware that he had been reported missing.

After Bernard's remains were found, Suffolk Constabulary launched a major murder investigation in both Tattingstone and Muswell Hill,with the assistance of the Met police. During the first four months 2045 statements were taken by the police. As well as efforts being made to establish the origin of the suitcases. One of the suitcases bore the initials ""P.V.A"" and a hand towel found within one of the suitcases had a laundry mark. Other physical evidence included a brand of matches found in Bernard's pocket that were sold in Israel at the time. 

A woman in Tattingstone reported that she had seen ""a man, who was middle-aged and wearing a dark trilby and a long trench coat, walking in the direction of Tattingstone on the Harwich road, carrying a suitcase”. Despite this, nobody has ever been convicted of the crime.

One obstacle that the police faced was that the location of the murder was unknown, although police stated that they believe the murder had occured in Suffolk.

Two main suspects were considered, both medical doctors. One of the doctors, Martin Reddington, had a surgery in Muswell Hill. In 1965, two years prior to Bernard's death, a warrant had been issued to arrest Reddington for indecent assault on males. Reddington fled to South Africa. Although he made return trips to the UK he was never questioned about Bernard's murder.

The second doctor suspected of the murder was John Byles. Byles left the UK for Australia in the 1970's when an investigation into the sexual abuse of boys between the ages of 9 and 14. He was subsequently arrested in Sydney for indecent assault on a young boy. Byles absconded on bail. His body was later found in a hotel having taken his own life. He left two suicide notes, one to Scotland Yard (home of the met police) and one to Reddington. The note to the met apologised for his crimes but did not specifically mention Tattingstone.

Since 1967, the case has been reexamined numerous times with tips still coming in. In 2012, a man reported to the police that he had seen two unattended suitcases and a man wearing medical clothes in the Ipswich dock area prior to the discovery of Bernard's body. The case was reopened in 2017,with police reviewing the forensic evidence and appealing for information.

A short while ago, it was announced by the Raleigh police that forensic genealogy analysis conducted by Othram identified a man named Paul Crowder as the person responsible for Jones's senseless death. Unfortunately, Crowder died in 2015.

From the article by [ABC11](https://abc11.com/alma-jones-raleigh-cold-case-rape-unsolved-murder-1977/11037852/):

The Raleigh Police Department announced Wednesday that they had solved the case of a 1977 rape and murder of a 77-year-old woman.

Alma Jones was raped and murdered more than 40 years ago.

Police said the unsolved case was revived in 2011 when the box it was stored in had been discovered during a transfer of older case boxes.

Raleigh homicide detectives continued to follow up over the years.

Police said a DNA profile for the suspect was developed and a man named Paul Crowder was identified as the person responsible.

However, Crowder died in 2015.

Raleigh police told ABC11 that Crowder was 35 at the time of the murder and lived in the same neighborhood as Jones.

Police got a saliva sample from Crowder's family member, which confirmed that he was the person responsible.

""While we recognize that this conclusion will not ease the pain and loss the family has experienced, we are pleased that they finally have resolution to something they have lived with for a long time,"" said Raleigh Police Chief Estella Patterson in a statements.
