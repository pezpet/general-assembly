**February 3, 2004**

Beautiful Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan blessed her parents Jennifer Buchanan and Shane Hinojosa in Monroe, Michigan and changed their lives forever. She was described as a little ""tomboy"" who hated dresses and was very fond of the look and sound motorcycles; She even has a motorcycle on her headstone. One of her favorite movies to watch was ""The Jungle Book"", and it was always on repeat.[(source)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37924376/nevaeh-amyah-buchanan) Nevaeh was described as ""having a smile that would warm the room, a personality that could tame the wildest heart, and a love for life that was only second to her love of family"". She loved preschool and was a great student. Nevaeh had also made a new best friend named Austin; He lived in the same apartment complex as her.

Naveah would have been 18 this year. Officially considered an adult. However, this poor child wouldn't even make it to kindergarten before her life was tragically and horrifically cut short. This is the unsolved murder of Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan. [(source)](https://merklefh.com/tribute/details/95/Neveah-Buchanan/obituary.html)

**May 24, 2009. Memorial Day Weekend. Monroe, Michigan.**

It was a warm spring day in Monroe, Michigan and 5-year-old Nevaeh Amyah Buchanan was playing with other children, going into and out of the apartments in Charlotte Arms where she lived with her mother, Jennifer, and her grandmother and legal guardian, Sherry. Around 6:30pm, Nevaeh told her mother that she was going to play with a friend upstairs in the same unit where they lived. Nevaeh was last seen wearing a light blue shirt with red and white horizontal stripes and a white V-neck collar and jean shorts; She was not wearing shoes or socks. When it was time for dinner, a child told Jennifer that Nevaeh had actually been playing outside on her scooter. ""She wasn't supposed to be outside,"" Jennifer Buchanan said. ""She was supposed to be upstairs at a neighbor's playing with her friend at their place."" [(source)](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/05/grace.coldcase.nevaeh.buchanan/index.html) . She began searching for her around 7pm. The only trace of Nevaeh was her tricycle, sitting abandoned on the edge of the driveway. 

After an hour of searching, 911 was called and a large-scale search for Nevaeh was ensued, including the K-9 unit and helicopters, as well as officers and volunteers, citizens of Monroe. A nearby quarry was searched by divers and sonar equipment. [(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7697163&amp;page=1) All 180 apartments were searched and residents were questioned. The only possible witness was Tim Finley, who had visited his sister who lived at the complex. He left the apartments around 7pm and he said he hadn't noticed any children playing outside, but did see a ""little red car"" speed out of the complex parking lot. [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb) Other then his sighting, no one saw or heard anything. 

Around 12:30am May 25, an Amber Alert was issued for her.

**June 4, 2009. River Raisin. 10 Days after Nevaeh Disappeared.**

Around 9:30am, two fishermen spent their morning fishing at the River Raisin riverbank near Dixon Road, about 10 miles from Charlotte Arms Apartments. While fishing on the rocks, the fishermen noticed a concrete block. At one point, one of the men stumbled on the concrete and a piece of it gave way, revealing a heartbreaking sight: human remains. Flies immediately swarmed to the exposed skin, and the two fishermen called the police. The clothes matched what Nevaeh was last seen wearing. It didn't take long for body to be identified, but they had to wait for DNA to confirm. 

It's important to note that the concrete/cement was not mixed properly. Nevaeh's body floated to the surface of the cement, revealing an imprint of her little body. The cement had also chipped away and crumbled easily. If the cement would have been mixed correctly, her body might have never been found.

The autopsy revealed that Nevaeh had died of asphyxiation after finding dirt in her nose, lungs, and windpipe [(source)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8089505). Manner of death, homicide. [(source)](https://interactive.wtol.com/pdf/BuchananReport.pdf) To make the matter worse, there is a possibility little Nevaeh had been buried face-down in the makeshift cement grave, alive. However, in the autopsy report, it could not be determined whether she was in fact buried alive, or had her face forcibly held down in dirt. Either way, Nevaeh had died by inhaling dirt. Police say there were no signs of abuse and that she had been buried there ""for a while"". Her body was heavily decomposed. There was no mention of sexual abuse in the autopsy report. [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb)

Noteworthy, brown carpet fibers were found on her body (possibly underneath her fingernails, but I've only seen one source with this information. [(source)](https://www.newswest9.com/amp/article/news/monroe-community-shocked-by-nevaehs-autopsy-results/512-bc61ab17-8060-440d-b984-ef1bd873466a) (I also get some information from NewsLibrary, but only excerpts because of a paywall. Will give credit in next parenthesis) (*Detroit News, The: Web Edition Articles (MI) - July 16, 2009 Nevaeh investigators probe carpet fibers,  Samples removed from apartment where slain girl lived.*)

**June 13, 2009. Her Funeral.**

Around 700 people attended Nevaeh's funeral, expressing their remorse and sorrow for ""Monroe's Little Angel"". “That one little girl was so powerful, she brought the community together,” said the Rev. Dale Hayford. Nevaeh's love for motorcycles was honored immensely. Nine officers on motorcycles led her to her final resting place. Her hearse was pulled by a Harley-Davidson, her favorite kind of motorcycle.  Another 60 motorcycles and 100 cars followed behind. At St. Joseph Cemetary, around 500 mourners looked on her grave site as the funeral director released a white dove into the sky. [(source)](https://www.theoaklandpress.com/2009/06/14/monroe-mourns-as-nevaeh-buchanan-laid-to-rest/)

A memorial erected where Nevaeh's body was found. Leaving stuffed animals, a wooden cross with her name, balloons. Fishermen don't normally go there after what happened. The two fishermen that found her body often tend to the spot where she was found, so people never forget. 

Did you notice that Nevaeh's name is ""Heaven"" spelled backwards? (Not to bring my emotions or religion into the post, but I like to think that is where she is. I like to think that Nevaeh is in Heaven.)

**The Investigation**

Before Nevaeh's body would be found, police had already arrested two persons of interest: convicted sex offenders George Kennedy and Roy Lee Smith. Rumors swirled that Jennifer and Kennedy were romantically involved, but she shot these rumors down. However, she did state that Nevaeh did look at Kennedy like a father figure, calling him ""Daddy George"" [(source)](https://medium.com/true-crime-by-cat-leigh/child-buried-alive-in-concrete-d0d9a38ac1cb). Jennifer was introduced to Smith through Kennedy. Even though she was aware of their sex offender statuses, she overlooked them but ""always kept her guard up about that"". With a search warrant, police searched the motel and van where Kennedy resided and found a blood soaked towel and tool, shorts, and photos of a young girl, but nothing to connect him to Nevaeh. (Noteworthy, there are reports that Kennedy did work with cement. There was also a cement company behind where Kennedy was residing). Both men were arrested for violating their probation by being around a child and were never officially named suspects in Nevaeh's disappearance. No evidence was found to suggest their involvement in Nevaeh's murder.  [(source)](https://www.foxnews.com/story/sex-offender-eyed-by-police-was-father-figure-to-missing-girl-says-mother)

Police have since shifted their focus away from the two sex offenders. ""We are looking in a different direction in recent months, based on our investigation,"" said Detective Sgt. Heath Velliquette. [(source)](http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/05/grace.coldcase.nevaeh.buchanan/index.html)

There was a third man, James Easter, who was named a person of interest by police. After being interrogated by police, Easter built a fire in his backyard and burnt some of his property. He was arraigned on arson charges. [(source)](https://nbc24.com/news/local/updated-authorities-want-to-talk-to-driver-of-minivan-in-nevaeh-case)

Police also were looking for a green mini-van that was seen at the Hollywood School at the time of Nevaeh's disappearance. Authorities were seeking information from the driver regards to seeing anything that night. [(source)](https://www.wtol.com/amp/article/news/latest-in-search-for-nevaeh-green-van-search/512-e71768b5-7eb5-4228-8557-f02d3f92941e) Also, the article mentions two young boys that police questioned about the night of her disappearance. ""The Nevaeh Buchanan Task Force, composed of the FBI, Michigan State Police, Monroe County Sheriff's Department and Monroe Police Department, identified the two boys, who were seen playing at the Hollywood School playground near the girl's apartment complex last Sunday. Authorities want to question the boys, believed to be 7-10 years old, to determine if they witnessed anything related to the girl's disappearance.""[(source)](http://forums.delphiforums.com/coldcases/messages?msg=5967.5&amp;gid=2096558024)  Again, I didn't see any follow ups about this. [(source)](https://nbc24.com/news/local/updated-authorities-want-to-talk-to-driver-of-minivan-in-nevaeh-case)

*(Now, of course I take news articles that don't even spell the victims name right with a grain-of-salt, but I thought that this was important to add. Also, this is the only article/report that I have seen with this information so, like I said, take it lightly. Take this information as you will.* [(source)](https://ohionewstime.com/what-happened-to-nevae-buchanan-an-unsolved-michigan-child-murder-case/280933/))

A woman (her identity was never revealed) had come forward and said that the day before Nevaeh's disappearance, she had seen Nevaeh ""looking at various cars in the parking lot. There was this black car she was trying to deflate from the tires.“ The woman had said she never saw the black car before, and it stayed in the lot until the next day: the day Nevaeh disappeared. According to the article, police received a complaint May 23, 3.2 miles away from Charlotte Arms in Greenwick Commons, about a man driving a black Grand Prix who had revealed his penis to two children asking them ""Have you seen one of these?"". The man was Paul Miller Jr.  Investigators interviewed Miller’s mother and father, ""who told police that his son would wake up in the morning and take a shower and would not return until late at night. They also said he was a friend of Roy Lee Smith, driving a black car, fishing in various places around Monroe."" [(source)](https://ohionewstime.com/what-happened-to-nevae-buchanan-an-unsolved-michigan-child-murder-case/280933/) Miller plead guilty to obscene acts. I have not seen any follow ups regarding Miller and his connection to Nevaeh. 

And the most current update: in 2014, Monroe's local paper revealed that police believe an unnamed man currently in prison for domestic abuse charges was a likely person of interest in Nevaeh's murder. [(source)](https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/monroe-mystery-continues-in-unsolved-murder-of-5-year-old-nevaeh) They do not have enough evidence to convict him or press charges. 

**Aftermath**

It has been 13 years since Nevaeh's kidnapping and murder, and there have been no arrests, no suspects, nothing. Nevaeh's distant cousin Risa Smith has been searching for answers to Nevaeh's case since Day 1. She runs ""Justice for Nevaeh"" on Facebook and has given multiple interviews/quotes. Risa also keeps binders of notes and information regarding her case. ""Smith says the place where Nevaeh's body was not easy to get to, and finds it hard to believe that no one saw anything regarding her disappearance."" [(source)](https://www.wtol.com/article/news/local/nevaeh-buchanans-body-was-found-11-years-ago-her-murder-is-still-unsolved/512-5838ebb3-83bd-47b3-9759-5a10b0e8d32c). Carla Nash, Nevaeh's paternal grandmother, believes that Nevaeh knew her murderer [(source)](https://www.fox43.com/amp/article/news/the-search-for-answers-who-killed-5-year-old-nevaeh-buchanan/512-acf45229-117d-48b7-8c73-725d4853ec25), and she's not the only one. Sherry Buchanan also believes Nevaeh knew her killer. ""Nevaeh had to know this person for her to go with that person. Everybody around that apartment said they heard no screaming or nothing""[(source)](https://www.wxyz.com/news/a-decade-later-still-no-answers-in-the-murder-of-5-year-old-nevaeh-buchanan) Who could have possibly abducted Nevaeh in broad daylight without anybody noticing? ""Everyone that we talked to said she was very shy and she would not go up to someone she did not know,"" Risa Smith says. ""No one we talked to said they heard a kid crying or screaming or asking for help. Did she know this person and that's why she willingly went? DID she willingly go? Nobody knows that."" [(source)](https://www.wtol.com/article/news/investigations/11-investigates/nevaeh-buchanan-murder-monroe-michigan-5-year-old-girl-disappears-found-encased-concrete/512-540252a0-7fd3-4542-aecb-62c7a6a2b269) 

To this day, there have been no arrests. No suspects. No updates. Nevaeh's murder remains unsolved and her case still lacks justice. Nevaeh deserves justice. Anyone with information is encouraged to call the detective's bureau at 734-240-7530 or CrimeStoppers at 1-800-773-2587. Anything helps.

**Thoughts**

There is a lot of inconsistent information regarding Nevaeh's murder. Some articles include James Easter as a person of interest, others just name George Kennedy and Roy Lee Smith as persons of interest. Some articles say she was found June 5, others June 4. The lack of consistent information leads to speculation and incorrectness that can jeopardize the investigation and lead to speculation. I tried to keep the information as consistent as possible and cited my sources. I can only hope that I did Nevaeh justice. I wanted to keep this respectful.

Now, I didn't include evidence found in the write up because I've seen many different things. Some articles state there was a Busch beer can, a cigarette butt, and a 90 lb bag of ready mix cement found at the scene. I only saw two sources that stated they found carpet fibers on her body.

Michael Martin was a 25-year-old man living in Kearsley, Greater Manchester, England. Michael was described as a loving son that always put his family first. His father described him as very family oriented, always looking out for his mum and siblings. Despite his good nature, Michael suffered from depression and anxiety, which lead him down a path that often got him involved in criminal activity.

**The last time Michael was seen alive**. On Sunday, August 7, 2016, Michael was in a car with a friend of his when they had some form of altercation. This resulted in the car stopping in the middle of the street. Both men got out of the car and began to search it for a short time while arguing. During the altercation, the car-key snapped in the ignition, however the two of them managed to jump-start the car, after which his friend drives the car to a nearby service station.

Michael’s friend went into the shop to see if he could obtain tools to repair the car. During this time, Michael arrives at the service station on foot, wearing 1 shoe. Michael opens 3 of the car’s doors and sits in the front passenger seat. He proceeds to close the driver’s side door and gets out of the vehicle, entering the shop to ask his friend if they can leave. As Michael’s friend returns to the car, Michael leaves the shop and begins walking back to the car.   
 Upon reaching the back of the car, Michael appears to touch the boot before turning 180 degrees. Michael is captured running in the opposite direction, looking behind him as he runs. Follow-up CCTV footage shows Michael run down a nearby street, Back Bolton Road. This is the last time Michael has ever been seen.

**Investigation.**

Police have searched several properties and some rural areas in Kearsley after his car was discovered on Vermere Avenue, but with nearly no evidence arising, Police have made little progress in the case.

There is no evidence to suggest Michael been on social media, used his phone or touched his bank accounts, and without having found a body, Police are treating the investigation as murder, suspecting that he was killed and hidden or disposed of.  (Greater Manchester Police (GMP) detective superintendent Lewis Hughes said: ""We believe that somebody has harmed Michael, killed him and we believe that his body has actually been disposed of"") 

In 2019, police began to search Clifton Country Park which in relation to Michael’s disappearance, however the search did not yield any results associated with the case. There is a £50,000 reward for information that leads to Michael’s killer being caught.

It's now been several years, police have searched and examined footage. There's a sizeable reward out for information and yet nobody has come forward. Michael's family is still left wondering what happened to him. No activity, no body and no evidence. Michael's parents have appealed multiple times across media, with their own suspicions ""I am appealing to anyone out there who knows information to come forward and do the right thing, particularly Michael's group of friends, who I believe have the answers"".

**Coverage**

As far as I (and many others on social media) can guess, Michael's affiliations with crime is probably associated with his disappearance, but it doesn't necessarily explain why he took off running. If anyone has a theory to what he might've seen, or what caused such irrational behaviour, let me know!

As to the last time I've seen media cover Michael's disappearance, The Bolton provided an update in September of 2020, however there was no substantial change in the case.

If anyone has information, they are encouraged to contact police or Crimestoppers anonymously.

TW: Suicide, physically abusive relationship.

**Before the murder**  
Sato Kozue and her friend, who coincidentally has the exact same name as her (I will refer to the murder victim as Kozue B and her friend as Kozue A from here on), were friends from high school. Around February 2007, they met Katsuyuki Obara (born 1979) when he approached them while they were hanging around at a gaming centre.

Kozue A and Obara start dating. Both Kozue A and B would drop out of high school and Kozue A starts a life with Obara that is devoid of stability. They sometimes lived in a car or at one of his friends' houses.

**The conflict with ""Z""**  
Obara tells Kozue A in May of 2007 that he is in trouble. Apparently, in October of the previous year, a man (we'll refer to as Z), who was in his 30s at the time, helped him get a job at a friend's construction company. However, Obara decides to flee from the workplace after working for just 10 days. This enraged Z, who started demanding compensation from Obara for tarnishing his reputation.

Obara, Kozue A and Obara's brother visit Z to beg him for forgiveness. Kozue A waited in the car while Obara and his brother went inside Z's house with Sake. However, things don't go as they hoped as Z was still enraged and even went as far as to threaten the two with a Katana sword, which he allegedly stuck in Obara's mouth. Z also used expressions and slangs commonly used by yakuza, specifically about cutting off one's finger as apology.  
Obara was forced to sign a contract where he promised to pay 1200000 Yen to Z. (Z would deny the allegation later when asked by a journalist and would claim that he didn't threaten them with a Katana sword and the amount he demanded was just 100000 Yen). He had to provide a joint guarantor and chose his girlfriend Kozue A.

Obviously Obara didn't have such money and since then, he was constantly trying to escape Z.  
Z started posting private information and pictures of Obara on online forums in order to find him.

On the 3rd of June 2008, Obara went to the police to report Z for threatening him. Oddly enough, Obara went back to the police later in an attempt to take back the police report. However, this was unuccessful, as there was a need for Kozue A to come to the police station with him, because she was the joint guarantor for the money Obara owed Z. But Kozue A refused to accompany him to the station.

The reason why Kozue A didn't want to go to the station with him was her decision to break up with Obara, because he was physically abusive towards her. In fact, she had already returned home to her parents.

The police was adamant that the repost should not scrapped and even asked Obara's father that since Z would be arrested within days, they should let the police keep pursiung him.

**The murder**

On the 28th of June 2008, Kozue B was hanging out with a friend, when Obara called her and asked her to meet him, because he wanted to confide in her about relationship issues he was having. The friend would later claim that Kozue B laughed and joked that she thinks she is going to be murdered.

After that day, Kozue B went missing and was found dead three days later on the 1st of July 2008 around 4:30 PM on a river bank by a road worker.

***Obara's disappearance and him becoming a fugitive***

On the day as Kozue B's body was found, Obara left a friend's house he was living at around 5 PM. After returning at about 7:30 PM, he was acting unusual. He hugged his friend and told him he had no option but to leave the town and cried.

At 9 PM, Obara caused a car crash. According to witnesses, he said that he is ""done for"" and ""has no option but to kill himself"".

On the following day, Obara asked a relative to drive him to the police station, since he had totalled his own car. But he then changed his mind and asked the relative to frop him off at the Unosu Cliff - a famous suicide spot.

After the relative had left, at 9:27 PM, he sent a mail to his brother and Kozue A, telling them about his intention of taking his own life. He then called a friend to thank him one last time, telling him he was about to jump. The friend immediately drove to the Unosu Cliff to convince Obara.  
When he arrived, Obara was sitting at the cliff and talking on the phone with someone the friend believed was a police officer. Relieved, the friend left the scene.

Kozue A also contacted police and asked them to check on Obara, but it was later revealed that the welfare check wasn't done at all.

On the 3rd of July, Obara's belongings including cigarettes and his wallet were found at the cliff, but because no body was found, the police determined the suicide was staged.

On the 29th, the police officially determined Obara as their suspect for Kozue B's murder, due to blood and items found in the car he had crashed the das before his (staged) suicide.

Obara is still missing to this day.

**Journalist Kuroki**

Former police Sergant and investigative journalist Akio Kuroki was suspicious as to why the police were so quick to paint Obara as their one and only suspect.

Kuroki then came up with a theory: Obara couldn't have committed the murder.  
Obara had hurt his right hand, injuring his ring finger and pinky. Obara's injury were so severe that he couldn't hold chop sticks and had to eat using a fork. The doctor who looked at Obara's hand claimed that the injuries on Obara's hand would have made it impossible for him to not only strangle the victim, but to discard of the body by throwing her over the bridge, down onto the river bank.

Furthermore, the items left at the cliff included Obara's sandles. It would be difficult for him to flee and disappear barefoot and there was no public transport in that area. Kuroki theorised that Obara could have been kidnapped by someone and killed.

Kuroki also claimed that Obara had no motive to kill Kazue B and even had an alibi.

The journalist concludes: It is clear that the conflict with Z has started this case. The police has even denied the fact that they had received a report from Obara. They are being lazy with the investigation. 

Kuroki spent the last two years of his life following this case. Even going to court with Obara's father to get the police to take down his son from the fugitive suspects-list. Collecting signatures by locals to get the police to set up a task force for this case. Kuroki was a journalist with integrity and dediation, who invested his personal time and money to find out what really happened. Still, the public wasn't really interested in this case.

On the 2nd of November 2010, Kuroki took his own life. In his suicide note, he wrote that the case in Iwate has changed his life and he does not regret that.

4,HoloGalaxy,1642749621,"Beth Kenyon was a Coral Gables High School special needs teacher and cheerleading squad coach, and a former fashion model who both won the Orange Bowl Princess title in 1982 and was a finalist in a Miss Florida contest.

On the afternoon of March 5, 1984, Beth was seen by a school security officer as she was leaving the school parking lot. However, that night she didn't return to the apartment she shared with a roommate and had not shown up for work the next day. She has not been seen since that day.

Beth's parents, alerted by her roommate, reported her missing. But dissatisfied with the Metro-Dade Police Department's handling of their missing person report, the Kenyons began an investigation of their own. They talked to friends, co-workers--anyone who might be able to give them any information that would be helpful in finding Beth.

They discovered through a friend of Beth's that she frequented a gas station near the school. Her father spoke to the attendant and learned that Beth had stopped for gas that day. He also saw her talking to a man in a Cadillac Eldorado, and she and the man talked of going to the airport to take photos.  That man, Christopher Wilder, paid for her gasoline and they drove off together. Later her parents discovered her abandoned car in the parking lot of Miami International Airport. 

Wilder had been linked to at least a dozen disappearances, rapes, murders and/or attacks of women in the US and Australia during the early to mid-1980s. It is suspected that she became one of his many victims. However, her body has never been found.

To add salt to their wounds, Wilder was no stranger to the Kenyon family. They personally knew Wilder. He had met Beth in 1982 when he was photographing contestants in the Miss Florida Pageant. He had visited their winter home several times, even going to dinner with the family on occasion. However, put off by his marriage proposal on their very first date, Beth was firm with Wilder in keeping their relationship as a casual friendship.

Her parents exhausted every avenue, even hiring psychics. Unfortunately, they died not knowing what happened to their daughter.

7,Afraid-Emotion-5102,1642723656,"This unsolved murder has always seemed to me like one of missed opportunities in getting justice for Emer, and in certain ways, it seems that the Garda Siochana, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, with respect to apprehending her killer.

Emer was originally from Ennistymon, County Clare, and was aged 23 at the time of her death.
She was an artist, and was studying at a college in Galway, and had just been accepted to the National College of Art and Design (NCAD) in Dublin around the time of her death.

She and her boyfriend had been living in a caravan, on his family's land, to save costs and put a bit of money towards building a house of their own. This caravan site was located in Ballybornagh, Tubber, close to the County Clare/County Galway border.
Prior to this, they had spent time travelling around the world.

On the caravan site they lived on, there was a man going by the name of John Griffin, from the Mervue area of Galway City.

On 8th April 2005, her boyfriend went off to work, and she had mentioned going to Griffins caravan, to get her mobile phone charged.

On that day she was off, as her college was closed, due to the funeral of pope John Paul 2nd.

Her boyfriend received a phone call, to say a caravan at the site was in fire. When he got there, Emma was missing, her car and dogs were still there, but John Griffins caravan was burnt to the ground.

The local authorities came out, and they found some human remains where John Griffins caravan had been. These would later be identified as Emma's.

Initially, the post mortem couldn't ascertain her cause of death, leaving her family in a form of limbo, but in 2010, her body was exhumed, and another post mortem carried out, coming to the conclusion that she had suffered severe injuries prior to the fire breaking out in the caravan, and her case was upgraded to a murder case.

John Griffin was Initially questioned by police, claiming that he hadn't been at his caravan, and slept elsewhere the night before.

Griffins behaviour afterwards was erratic, and suspect.
Two days after initially being questioned, he barricaded himself in Dun Aengus Fort on Inishmore. He was eventually overpowered, and admitted to a psychiatric hospital, before he discharged himself, changed his appearance and went back on a ferry to Inish Mor. 

A pile of his clothes were placed on the edge of a cliff, to apparently make it look like suicide. The Gardai believes that he faked his own death, and has been drifting around Europe on assumed identities.

There are various stories online about John Griffin, hinting about his background, but apart from the fact that he's from Mervue, there's little to be gleamed about him.

Supposedly he's on the interpol website (can't find him on it), and a recent article has her father stating that he was seen in Morocco. Her family have believed over the years that Griffin has been protected by people connected to him.

8,Main_Initiative,1642711332,"**Saturday marks 15 years since Karen Bodine was murdered; her nude body posed and left near a Washington state gravel pit. Who Killed Karen Bodine?** 

[Karen Bodine ](https://uncovered.com/cases/karen-bodine)was a 37-year-old mother of three living in Olympia, Washington. She was loving and creative–known to streak her hair with pink highlights and leave secret notes in her kid’s school notebooks as a way to let them know she was thinking of them. While she struggled with substance abuse; her family and friends remember her as a loving mother, daughter, and friend.

**The last time Karen was seen alive.** On Sunday, January 21, 2007, Karen was wandering through the streets of Lacey, Washington when a neighbor noticed her and called the police. When police arrived, Karen [brushed them off ](https://www.chronline.com/stories/woman-is-homicide-victim-sheriffs-office-says,214717)telling them she was fine, despite not wearing a winter coat despite the cold. After lots of insisting, the officer left. At the time Karen was staying with a friend, she had left her parent's home after an intense domestic [incident with her boyfriend, resulting in a protection order](https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/crime/article237646739.html).

The next day, Monday, January 22, Karen was staying with that same friend and many other house guests at the time who were known to do drugs. They [reported seeing her around 3 AM when she left the house on foot](https://thecinemaholic.com/karen-bodine-murder-how-did-she-die-who-killed-her/). This would be the last time Karen would be seen alive. 

**When she was discovered.** The next morning on [January 23, 2007, Karen’s nude body was discovered](https://uncovered.com/cases/karen-bodine/timeline) at the entrance of a gravel pit on Little Rock Road in Rochester, Washington— approximately 30 miles from her home. A witness would tell police they saw a small, brown early 1980s Datsun with a lighter color camper shell seen around 7:50 am at the gravel road entrance. Despite being found in an unnatural position, investigators determined that there were no signs of sexual assault but she was strangled; but her body was left in a position that would suggest that that the murdered “[wanted the shock value](https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/who-killed-karen-bodine-the-vicious-murder-of-the-mother-of-three-remains-unsolved).” 

Additionally, Karen was completely nude with a ligature around her neck. Multiple DNA profiles were identified on the ligature and sent off for testing–which has still not been shared to this day. Law enforcement is hoping advancements in DNA technology will result in answers. The detective in the case is quoted as saying: “...[when you have a case that has as little evidence as this one does and has gone on as long as it has, more than one person was probably involved."" ](https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/who-killed-karen-bodine-the-vicious-murder-of-the-mother-of-three-remains-unsolved)

**Where the case stands today.** It’s been15 years and Karen’s case remains unsolved, but her children are still actively fighting for answers for their mother. In 2019, her children participated in a CrimeCon sponsored event aimed at sharing details of her case with the public in hopes of finding additional information, and earlier this year her case was featured on ""Still a Mystery: A Community Betrayal"" on the ID Channel. Her daughter Karlee also maintains several [billboards in the area where she was last seen](https://www.nbcrightnow.com/news/cold-case-files-five-more-minutes/article_1415a260-383b-11eb-a241-db60e92c7713.html) hoping someone will come forward with information.

But all these years later her family is still left wondering: who killed Karen? Was she a victim of a random attack or something more sinister? Can the DNA collected at the scene lead to answers? If you have any information regarding Karen's case, please call Crime Stoppers of the South Sound at (800) 222-TIPS (8477) or Detective Mickey Hamilton at (360) 786-5279.

The link above is a great write up, so definitely check it out. I don’t want to rehash what has already been said, but I want to bring awareness to a cold case in my area.

I live less than an hour from the campus of IWU, and had never heard of this case until yesterday. I was listening to a new podcast I found and was shocked to hear about it. The podcast host (Megan Musgraves) was abducted at 9 years old by one of the initial suspects (Grenier) in Tricia’s case. He is referred to as the One Armed Man. 

Short summary of Tricia’s case: 1993, she was a freshman at Indiana Wesleyan University. She was walking to a supermarket for refreshments during a study break and was never heard from again. It was one of the warmest days in March and she had gone running that day, she was an avid runner. They believe her run is the reason the dogs got confused when trying to follow her trail. 

A man in the community told police some boys had been playing basketball at the time she went missing, but these boys were never identified. This man provided proof of people playing basketball because he had his video camera that caught the audio of the basketball court, no video footage of the boys though. None of the boys have came forward either. 

Larry Hall is now considered the prime suspect and is in prison for life on unrelated charges. It is believed he may have killed upwards of 40 young girls in the Midwest, but it has never been proven. He has a twin brother, Gary, whom he traveled with for civil war re-enactments. These travels often coincided with missing girls from Nevada, Missouri to Ohio, and as far north as Wisconsin. Larry has an IQ of roughly 80, and many believe that Gary (or another accomplice) had to have helped with the killings, if they happened because of his lower intelligence level.

*After consultation with Medical Examiner Dr. Stephen Cohle, who performed the original autopsy, “Matilda” has been positively identified as* ***Shelly Rae Kephart AKA Shelly Rae Christian****.*

*The Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office remains hopeful that the positive identification of Shelly will provide closure for family, and investigative direction for Cold Case Detectives.*

*Anyone with any information about this investigation or who knew Shelly Rae Kephart AKA Shelly Rae Christian is asked to contact the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office or Silent Observer at 1-877-88SILENT (745368) or mosotips.com Some photos of Shelly are attached to this e-mail. Shelly was known to wear unique glasses as can be seen in one of the photographs. She may or may not have worn them near the time of her death. Shelly was last believed to be in the Grand Rapids, MI area as of February of 1994.*

&amp;#x200B;

If memory serves, there was a slew of murders in the Grand Rapids area in the mid 1990's targeting working girls and homeless/vulnerable women. I wonder if she could be one of that killer/killers victims.

15,j0nd0,1642678576,"I’m not hugely involved on Reddit… usually just lurking around and reading, but I’ve been set on a path to figure out what the hell happened here after consuming tons of media coverage going over this investigation. 

Theresa Corley was murdered in December of 1978 at the age of 19. It’s been 43 years now and there’s a lot to go through, but her sister Gerri believes she is just a few small pieces of information away from closing the case. 

The more I delved into this, the more aggravated I got. The connections between those mostly likely responsible, people of influence within the town, and authorities overseeing the investigation, make it hard to believe all the screw ups are simply due to incompetence. 

My full write up for this case would rival that of a lengthy Ph.D. dissertation, but a summary can be found below. After hearing about what happened, I’ve been borderline obsessed… wracking my brain, trying to figure out which one of the many suspects it was, that took her life. The rapists? The drug dealing boyfriend? A person from town with wealth and influence? There are so many possibilities… but I think it goes without saying, that someone who’s still around is holding something back.


Summary

On December 8, 1978, Bellingham Police received a call informing them that a man had found a deceased female along I-495 North. While police were responding to the scene, a man entered the station asking if Theresa’s body had been found. This was odd, as officers hadn’t even began their investigation yet. How could this man know this?

Once on scene, officers located the nude remains of a white female, later identified as Theresa Corley, with her clothing and shoes left beside her. She had been strangled to death via ligature strangulation.

During the investigation, authorities learned that the man who called in the information leading them to Theresa had given a fake name, causing some to believe that the man who came into the station was also the one who had called, but this was never confirmed. 

As the timeline of what happened to Theresa was pieced together, investigators learned the following. 

She had been celebrating her boyfriends birthday at a bar in Franklin, Ma when they got into a fight and she left on foot. 

She was later picked up by four men (some sources say three) who brought her to the Presidential Arms apartment where she was sexually assaulted. 

Once she was able to make her way out of the apartment, she was picked up by two different men who transported her short distances towards her destination (home). 

She was dropped off in front of the Bellingham Police station by the second driver, but never went inside. 

She was then last seen alive outside of a Dairy Queen, located only a short distance from the police station, around 5:30 am. 

Throughout the investigation, valuable pieces of evidence have been either lost or destroyed. 

At this time, authorities are supposedly in possession of “items” they are testing for DNA. 

This case has been touched on in this sub, some 4 years ago. Links to those posts below.

16,prajitoruldinoz,1642673765,"Hi guys! I found this post on Facebook and I thought to bring it here because on Facebook it went unnoticed (it has only 16 'likes'). The original poster is Sherri Lynn Snider, one of the daughters of Diane Theresa Francis, a Florida woman who vanished in thin air almost 20 years ago.

According to [Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/diane-theresa-francis), Francis was last seen by her daughters in Melbournce, Florida sometime in June 2003. She was arrested for trespassing in Jacksonville, Florida on November 27, 2005, and was last seen when she was released the next day. This is the last indication of her whereabouts. At the time of her disappearance, she had a ""high risk"" lifestyle and was transient throughout southeast Florida.

She has never been heard from again, and her daughters hired a private investigators who was unable to locate her. A former boyfriend reported Francis missing in 2015. Few details are available in her case, but her determined daughter has spent years piecing together every clue she could find.

This is Sherri Lynn's original FB post (edit: I removed the link because it breaks the sub's rules) where she tells the whole story. Maybe these details can help someone remember something and come forward with the missing pieces of this puzzle. Or maybe they can inspire the sleuths to join Sherri Lynn in her search for answers.

**This is Sherri Lynn's original post, copy/pasted:**

***My Mother; Diane Theresa Francis***

*{In this document; I try my best to relive and walk you through my mother's life as I saw it and how other loved ones of hers have seen it throughout the years. They have helped me fill in the huge gaps, but there are many missing pieces that I still don't know. Remember, I was only 4 years old when the issues with Child Protective Services in Florida started and only 9 years old the last time I physically laid eyes on my mother.*

*My mothers legal name is Diane Theresa Francis. She was born July 7, 1968 in SomersviIle New Jersey. From what I've gathered she was like any other ordinary child but things became difficult for her growing up when her parents separated and divorced when she was only about 12 years old.*

*There is some speculation that she may or may not have experienced some physical/sexual abuse as a child, but nothing has ever been confirmed to date. Diane grew up with both of her parents up until about the age of 12 when they decided to divorce; Rosalie Lamonto is her mother and her father is David Leslie Francis Sr.*

*Diane was always a Daddy's girl growing up and decided to live with her father in Florida when her parents separated. Diane also has two younger Brothers David Leslie Francis Jr, and Michael J.Francis. They chose to move to Florida with their father as well.*

*My mother was believed to be a mostly well behaved child up until about the age of 12 or so when her brothers (David and Michael) told their mother that Diane had been “sneaking boys in and out of the house in the middle of the night.” Nothing has been confirmed about this accusation either.*

*My mother went on to graduate from 8th grade and continued on normally for the next year. When my mother reached high school she became a drop dead gorgeous young woman, boys were constantly pursuing her. At this point she began to drift far far away from the once normal and well behaved child she once was. Her father recalls her “getting in with the wrong crowd” One of these boys she chose to hang out with even got her pregnant at 16 years old ( possibly Kenny Feckowitz).*

*My mother would later give birth to this baby prematurely in the hospital bathroom. This baby was my sister “ Stephanie Francis”. She was born and died on April 11,1985. She had a proper burial and was laid to rest in Denville, NJ at the Denville Cemetery. Different encounters from Stephanie's birth time period tell numerous different stories, some say my mother was devastated and that she never came back from this, others say she showed no remorse or connection to the child whatsoever.*

*In the year 1990,( just five years after the passing of my sister Stephanie). My mother would meet my biological father Charles Edward Snider, (the night of my fathers birthday 1990, at a bar in long branch NJ.) My father also says my mother was in a relationship already at that time but her boyfriend (Kenny) was away so they got together secretly. Just one year after my mother and father met my sister Jessica Marie Snider was born September 22nd,1991 in Morristown New Jersey.*

*My Birthday would follow not too far behind hers. I was born in Long Branch New Jersey on June 15th, 1993. Somewhere in between the birth of my sister and my mother's pregnancy with me she would take a turn for the worse. My father claims while my mother was pregnant with me she started doing drugs and partying as well as cheating and not coming home some nights. This came as a shock to me as in the 28 years I’ve been alive I have yet to hear that I was a “drug baby” (but I’d believe pretty much anything at this point.)*

*My mother and father would continue to live in New Jersey moving here to there in order to make ends meet, staying with family whenever possible. Eventually they would end up in the state of Florida in the year 1994.*

*My mother said she had it with New Jersey and claimed she wanted to be near her father again. (just 1 year after I was born) My father claims they moved the family here in order to be closer to my grandfather Dave and step-Grandmother Rita Cook (per my mother's request). Little did they know this might be the move that set my mother's fate.*

*Just one year after their move to the state of Florida, they end up in a trailer park where my mother would meet a man by the name of John Schmitt. She told my father “I'm going to marry John and he's going to be the girl's father now”. In a sense she was telling my father she didn't want to see him anymore.*

*My dad then moved back to New Jersey to be back home with his family. We never saw him again. My mother met John Schmitt in 1995. My father Charles Snider claims my mother started seeing John while she was still dating him. The relationship between John Scmitt and my mother was a happy one at times but like every place we would soon end up, my mother let the drugs get the best of her and for the most part….us too because she had lost us again.*

*When my mother met John Boggs it was 1997 just two years later and he had just served a four year sentence in prison, and he was fresh out the day that they met. My mother was actually dating one of his former friends at that time. Daniel Irwin, the man my mother was dating at the time, was also the manager of some apartments that John Boggs' family owned (Hired by John himself).*

*John was returning from prison to pick back up managing the property for his family. John claims he swooped in like a hawk and stole my mother from his buddy. (Daniel Irwin) This was now the beginning of another shaky and mysterious relationship. We would soon return to my mother's care and begin a life with her and John Boggs.*

*In the year 1999 My mother was still living with John Boggs. John was an abusive man and also a man who fell madly in love with my mother. I recall him throwing her across the house on one occasion which also included him punching his fists through the door to get to her, my sister and I jumping on him kicking and screaming to try and help my mother. Drugs were always present with the two of them together.*

*My mother always denied the abuse to police in order to continue on as if nothing had happened and keep her place to live for us kids.There were good times as well, i don't neglect the facts here but the situation as a whole was a nightmare to say the least. My mother was tired and the police were called this same year in response to her trying to commit suicide because she had lost us girls again…... John Boggs and my mother had a history and I don't quite know everything that entails but he gave her his tattooed initials as a gift and they were always inseparable when things were good.(We’ll definitely get back to John Boggs but he goes silent on this case until the year 2015!!)*

*Roger Foreman was driving down the road one day in or around the year 2000 just one year later. He was in his work van (he ran a landscape business) and he spotted my mother on the side of the road walking, he stopped her so he could speak to her. She said she had just gotten into a huge fight with her crazy boyfriend at the time (John Boggs) and she explained she did not want to go back home to him... That was the beginning of their relationship right then and there. We soon were allowed to visit with my mother once again.*

*John would often show up at our house looking for my mother and in turn this would cause physical fights with Roger Sr. Roger Foreman Sr. had a son of his own and things were seeming to be looking up for the most part. We spent a lot of time with Roger Sr, his son and my mother (mostly on Arranged supervised visits) this continued until we were allowed to go home to my mom”permanently“.*

*My mom was happy again and always joking, almost back to her normal “Di-Di” self in a sense. (Apparently Roger had lost his son in the past and offered his caseworkers contact information to my mother in order for my mother to work on getting my sister and I back into her care as well). I felt like it had been no time and we were back with my mom again and trying to never look back from it, but it was surely not the end….*

*In late 2003 Jessica and I were removed from my mother's care for the last and final time. We lived in the IndianRiver Cottages.(they were these awful bright pink, one room, 1 bed shacks). Jessica and I spent the majority of our time while living here in the trailer park down the road with friends or in the neighborhood that surrounded our loop of run down hotel rooms. I remember smoking cigarettes with the kid next door all the time or just basically doing whatever we wanted. Going inside our house was a rare occasion.*

*In 2003 our caseworker pulled up to the cottage where we lived. We were so traumatized by this point that when our case worker showed up to remove us this time…... we ran for our lives, because this time we knew. We took one look at each other swung open the back door of our shack and off into the woods we both went tripping over one another screaming as if it would help in some way. We knew what was happening.*

*All in the same moment so many thoughts crossed my 10 year old mind. “Three strikes you're out mom” “this is it” “don't look back” I remember jessica telling me we should go to our friends house and i'll never forget turning around and seeing my mom being put into a police car and knowing that was the last time i may ever see her again. When we reached our destination…. Our friend's mother ended up having to call DCF in order to protect herself (understandable). We were only about 9 &amp; 11 years old.*

*Jessica and I now had to re-enter the Florida foster care system. We lived in multiple homes, some really good and some bad. I won't go into full detail as I don't remember it all but my sister and I experienced a wide variety of homes from shelters to facilities, overnight arrangements, relative care, adoptive placements, respite care. On the flip side there were Amazing homes in south Florida that I will never ever forget. Part of why I’m a somewhat structured and steady headed human being is from my Foster mom’s Joanne, Alice, Denise, Dedra, Sheila, Maryellen,Joanie, Allison and Ms. Liz. These women are forever a part of me.*

*I just won’t deny the bad side of it all either. We once slept on the dcf office floor because there were no homes available at the time that would accept two pre-teen girls.( we weren't exactly top of the line product for foster parents) I remember being lost in the Florida foster care system at one point and looking back it means so much more now than it ever did to me then. I was just a number on a bed. We all were.*

*The Florida foster care system failed my sister and I in a major way. Years ago they had my entire family convinced (including my father) that we were going to be happily adopted and that they should basically stay away from us. This has never been nor was this ever the case.*

*At this time Jessica and I were at an all girls ranch in Cocoa Beach Florida and had not been checked on by any caseworker in weeks. We experienced several “Adoptive Placements'' but none of them ever worked out. Jessica and I went on like this until about 2008, where we found ourselves in an all girls shelter with some pretty strict rules on not contacting biological families.*

*One night, I finally took a stand and stole a phone book from the office in the shelter we had just been dropped off in. I searched all night and finally found one name “Rita may Cook.” I didn't know why i recognized this name or what it meant but I knew I had to try it.*

*I shakely picked up the phone trying to be as quiet as I could (what I was doing was illegal) I dialed that number twenty times and twenty times over I erased it, racking my brain for any memory of this woman and how I might have known her. Finally it hit me, “Rita may cook, Rita may not” something my mother always joked about.*

*This was the woman I called grandma my whole life. I remember my hand hitting the call button without a moment to second guess my decision and the phone was ringing…..ringing…..ringing…&amp; then...I heard her.”h-hello…..w-who is this?” a raspy startled voice answers…( it was late)…. I say hesitantly…. “Its sherri”….. “Sherri who?” she replies…. “ Sherri Lynn Snider” I say. Before she says anything else I can hear tons of rustling and then she yells “DAAAVVEEEEE” calling out to my Grandfather (David Francis) from across the house.*

*After years of being seperated i had found them. This was it. This was my fight ending…..this was my worry leaving… this was everything I had ever hoped for. This was my FAMILY!…...my mommy.*

*We were holding a yard sale at the shelter so I invited my grandfather and the next day he showed up. The hilarity of it all was that we found out they lived 1 street over and had lived there since I was a little girl. After 9 years of being separated we were randomly placed from 3 hrs away,…1 block from my mother’s fathers home....But again, this was not the end of my journey to find my mother.*

*Later it would be discovered that my family had no idea of my mothers current whereabouts. They had not even the slightest bit of answers for us and so……we were completely shattered all over again. Before we knew it we were in relative care with my Aunt Joanne Francis in 2008-09. We both aged out of the Florida foster care system at 18 years old. This didn't happen for me until the year 2009-2010. This is when all of my “Real” searching began….*

*A few Years ago I discovered some odd information but, it was too little too late. This usually happened with my mother’s situation. I found an alias, a traffic citation, numerous police reports, I obtained my mothers last mugshot, court records, arrest records, and I also ran lengthy internet paid and free searches. None of which led me to any current information regarding my mothers current or even most recent whereabouts.*

*I found my mother’s best friend whom we all lived with around the time we last saw my mother but by the time I found her, she had already passed away a year prior to finding her. I found her best friends daughters also who were just little babies (4 years old) when all of this happened and had been taken away as well at the same time we were taken. Everything that has ever existed regarding my mother Diane Theresa Francis or her alias, existed during or before the year 2005 possibly 2006.*

*I hate to admit the facts here but it's been almost 20 long long years of me hoping, praying, wishing my mother would just commit a crime or call/show up… Mess up…something…...anything. But she Doesn’t. I contacted each and every one of my mother’s former boyfriends and got different recollections from each one.*

*One boyfriend was long gone and out of the picture by the time she disappeared. Her last known boyfriend claims to have left her at some type of boarding house right near the house we last saw her in around 2004-2005.*

*Another One of her boyfriends claims he has no idea. I guess My first “ real “ &amp; official attempt at locating my mother would have had to have been in 2009-2010. This was the year we reunited with our “entire” family and had asked them where she was.*

*The answers we received were vague and scattered. “We had Cop friends of ours look for her and the trail ended in Palm Bay, Florida” &amp; “We did everything we could for her,she didn’t want help” and my most favorite “You need to let it go.” From then on, I made it my mission and mine alone to do whatever it takes to find her.*

*I contacted the Florida department of children and families’ services and also my prior caseworker (Beatrice Borsiquot) in order to obtain my foster care case file. They still will not release the entire thing to me stating that I would have to go there in person to obtain it in its entirety and I’ve been told it will be destroyed soon as well.*

***I made numerous calls to the Melbourne, Palm Bay and Jacksonville Florida police departments and sheriff's offices as well as jails (with efforts in mind of filing a missing persons report). I was laughed at…. multiple times. I was told that my mother is a full well grown adult and can make her own decisions.*** *If she is not under a certain age, In immediate danger, a danger to others, taken against her own will, suicidal and a few other things then she can choose to disappear and there’s nothing I or anyone else can do.*

*They advised me she hadn’t been in the area in years anyways.* ***They asked me on my birthday 2019 “is something wrong ma’am why do you seem so upset about your mother?” I hung up the phone. My mouth couldn’t even express the amount of emotion that was going through my heart at that moment and it all just came out as sobs…. “I’m so upset” because my mother, the woman who gave me breath and life to breathe has not been seen in almost two decades and no one can seem to see the immediate issue with that but me.***

*At this point I’m offended; I start posting to Facebook more and more. I start adding anyone and everyone with my last name or my mother’s last name. I find an awesome cousin of mine who happens to be a crime junkie living in the same state as my bio father (Maggie Snider) . She came to visit me and we went to the crime junkie showduring her visit here in Arizona. We met Sarah turney and Erin Reed after the show for drinks. I then feature on “Sipping on Some Crime Podcast”. This would be the first of many episode interviews to follow.*

*I started contacting the provided emails from police websites for public records requests. I entered requests with Brevard county and Jacksonville duval county. I found an alias just by searching her jail number alone with no other info included (on inmate websites). I obtained a copy of the FDLE records request. During all of the record requests and paying for online reports from radaris and people searches.*

*The trail always ends in the same exact location. 5624 Cagle Rd in Jacksonville, Florida. The location was previously a Ramada Inn and is now an Econolodge. My sister and I sent a good friend from our old church and his friend who is a licensed PI to these locations in Melbourne and in Jacksonville. I have the conclusion from those findings and they were what I’ve already sent you. Not to mention the PI was given everything that I also gave you prior to making this venture to search for my mom.*

*All in all his findings were that I need to personally go to Jacksonville where my mother frequented and walk the streets of US1 to find her. He looked every which way up down left right backwards and sideways in the systems he has access to and found the same things I did. Less even.*

***Today the case is ice cold and I’m left with bits and pieces of half ass answers.*** *no one remembers anything and better yet they want nothing to do with the repercussions and or history they’d have to face in order to be even slightly involved.* ***Every single day that passes is such a heartbreak to me, my sister and those who know what a beautiful person my mother truly is because I know this life is so so short. I can only hope that my life will just be long enough to discover what truly happened to my beautiful mother Diane Theresa Francis.***

*Side note: In the year 2015, (16 years after dating and beating my mother.) John Taylor Boggs calls the Jacksonville Sheriff's office and asks if he can report someone missing. He proceeds to tell the sheriffs office that Diane is his former friend and he hasn't seen her in “12” years, and he is “worried” about her.*

*He claims he is the step father of my sister and I and he hopes my mother is okay. He also proceeds to tell the sheriff's office defining facts about my mother, including her drug habits, tattoos, hair color etc. mind you this call was made one day apart from the day his neighbor and friend George Contos goes missing and is also reported missing. I’ve since found another missing individual associated with my mother’s ex boyfriend.* *Sherri Lynn Snider*

21,BuscandoMemo,1642648682," A team of citizen cold case sleuths diving in a river Wednesday found a car that matches the description of a vehicle belonging to a woman who disappeared in 2017. Police have not yet positively identified the car as belonging to Stephanie Torres, who went missing in 2017, but her family members are standing by in hopes of having their questions answered. Waco police, on hand at Brazos Park East on Wednesday, were investigating whether the blue and gray 2006 Kia Rio found by divers with Adventures With Purpose  belonged to Torres. 

Torres was days from celebrating her 43rd birthday when she disappeared. She was last seen leaving her home on Dec. 20, 2017, but did not take her cellphone, wallet or medication with her. 

The car was found in the cold, murky waters of the Brazos River in Cameron Park about an hour after the dive began. “I’m scared. I’m nervous. I don’t have words at this point,” daughter Bianca Torres said as the search for the car unfolded.

Adventures With Purpose, which Oregon-based scuba diver Jared Leisek founded, conducted the search in the Brazos River after connecting with the family via social media last year. The group originally organized environmental cleanup dives before turning to searching for missing people.

For other True Crime nerds, this case has been on our minds for a while.   
 

In 2017, the 12th richest people in Canada, Barry and Honey Sherman were executed in their Toronto home (they were hung). There are three major theories about the murder, and although the case is still unsolved, investigators believe the evidence they have acquired heavily points toward one.   

**Theory One (unlikely):**   

**The kids did it.** The Shermans had a turbulent relationship with each other, but seemed to be okay around the time of the murder. Documents reveal that the estate was split equally between all of the kids. The kids have also hired their own private investigation teams to look into the case. None of them are persons of interests. Rich kids killing their parents seems to be a thing, but probably not in this case.

**Theory Two (unlikely, yet troubling):**   

**Honey Sherman (and probably Barry) was a racist.** Relatives of the Shermans describe her as a women who did not care about ‘political correctness’ and openly used derogatory language toward people of Middle-Eastern / Arabic / Muslim background. The home they were assassinated in was under construction at the time, with many ethnically diverse people frequently coming-and-going. One theory to support this is that the Shermans employed a full staff for their home, including a concierge and they were notoriously lazy about security, often not even turning on their cameras or activating alarms. The killer appeared to know this, and the layout of the home. What makes this theory unlikely is that Honey is believed to have not been the intended target but just ended up being there at the wrong time.  
 

**Theory Three (most likely):**   

**Barry Sherman owed $1 billion to pharmaceutical companies that he was refusing to pay.** He would have easily been able to keep those fees tied up in the legal system until he expired naturally or got out of them altogether (he was 75). He was becoming obstinate as a leader and CEO, was not well-liked at the company and refusing to retire. The fees were the result of Barry’s drug company refusing to pay royalties for selling no-name brand drugs. I don’t have a great understanding of Canadian patent law or the inner-workings of the pharmaceutical industry, but Mega-Pharma (bigger than Big Pharma) were NOT in the Barry Sherman fanclub.    

The theory that Barry was assassinated by Pharma rivals is supported by four years of pouring through his e-mails, texts, business records, diaries and through interviewing coworkers, family and friends. The biggest red flag / smoking gun was that all of Barry’s outstanding debts were settled by the company immediately after his death in a very quiet and expeditious manner. It is likely the case will never be solved, and it’s even possible Barry’s own company assisted in the hitjob. But long-story-short, he was whacked for things related to his business, both as a retaliation but also as a warning to other minor billionaires not to push their luck against the giants.

Basically, Beatriz Angélica was a 7 year old girl that was found dead with stab wounds at a school in the Brazilian city of Petrolina, back in 2015. The whole story was already posted, so please go here in case you're not familiar with it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/i6kc96/the\_strange\_case\_of\_the\_7\_year\_old\_girl\_that\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/i6kc96/the_strange_case_of_the_7_year_old_girl_that_was/)

Beatriz's parents never gave up on finding the person responsible for their daughter's death. In December 2021, they walked more than 430 miles, between Petrolina and Recife, to seek justice. The act lasted 23 days and had the support of municipal authorities and residents of the cities through which they passed.

On January 11 2022, more than six years after the murder, Pernambuco Scientific Police determined that the DNA found on the knife left at the crime scene belongs to Marcelo da Silva, 40, who is in prison for other crimes since 2017. His DNA was part of the State Bank of Genetic Profiles.

Marcelo confessed to the murder and was indicted after being heard by delegates. According to the Secretary of Social Defense of Pernambuco, Humberto Freire, Marcelo would be on the outskirts of the school in search of money to leave the city. He had been drinking and had no intention of entering the school or committing any crime (he actually thought it was a church). At the scene, the accused found Beatriz. Seeing that he was carrying a knife, the girl got scared and started screaming; “in the face of this exasperation, the fright she showed, he ended up silencing her with stab wounds”. The Secretary also claims that the crime was not planned and had no accomplices. Still according to him, 10 knife blows were recorded and not 42 as had been reported. 42 is the number of photographs of the stab wounds that appear in the lawsuits, as the wounds are photographed from different angles.

Beatriz's family believe that Marcelo really is the killer, but argue that many questions still need to be answered. Her mother doesn't think the alleged motive for the crime is true.

Today, it was announced that Marcelo wrote a letter stating that he was pressured to confess to the crime. The State Department of Social Defense stated that ""the entire investigation into the murder of the girl Beatriz is being carried out within all legal parameters, with zeal and honesty"".

The police stated that they will continue the investigation and that they will maintain dialogue with the Public Ministry of Pernambuco for the continuity of the process.

36,CherryBlossom724,1642554371,"**Background**

Christopher Ruess and Stella Knight married on April 2, 1905. He was a Unitarian minister and she was a dancer and artist. Their first child, Waldo (named after Ralph Waldo Emerson) was born on September 5, 1909. A second son, Everett (named after the author and historian Edward Everett Hale), was born on March 28th, 1914, in Oakland, California. 

Both Stella and Christopher had a deep love of books and of art, which they imparted to their children. They were avid diarists as well and encouraged both of their sons to not only keep a diary themselves, but to also copy out long passages from their respective diaries in letters home when they were separated from their parents. 

In September 1918, the family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts, because Christopher had decided to take a job with the Chautauqua Industrial Art Desk Company. When Stella’s father became ill, she and Everett traveled across the country by train to Los Angeles to care for him. Along the way, they made several stops at memorable locations such as the Grand Canyon and the Yosemite Valley. Everett was nine at the time and began keeping his first diary during this trip. His earliest writings showed his growing fascination with nature and his love of traveling. As Everett grew a little older, he also developed a passion for writing poetry and painting. He was even able to sell some of his watercolor paintings from time to time. 

Everett graduated high school in 1931. Though his parents very much wanted him to attend college, Everett had other ideas. That same year, Everett went off on his first solo adventure, hiking and camping out in the wilderness, as well as keeping a detailed diary about his feelings and experiences, and writing frequent letters to his family. He also loved visiting Anasazi ruins and collecting artifacts from these sites. Thus began his pattern of hitchhiking, camping, and hiking for months at a time before briefly returning home, only to leave once again, starting the cycle anew. He met many people along the way during these solo trips, but a certain shyness and inherent desire for solitude kept him from forming connections with most of the people he encountered during his travels, a fact which he sometimes lamented in his diaries. He tried to support himself by selling paintings, but because he was rarely able to make a sale (and keep in mind that this was during the Great Depression), his expeditions were mostly financed by his parents. 

Everett adopted a small and adorable brown and white dog named Curly, from a Navajo Reservation in 1931, to have as a companion. He also always had either a pair of burros or a pair of horses to accompany him out in the wilderness. 

Everett suffered from frequent periods of dark moods, which some have theorized may have actually been depressive episodes. In a letter to his older brother Waldo in 1931, Everett alluded to having been suicidal the previous summer. 

&gt; Whatever I have suffered in the months past has been nothing compared with the beauty in which I have steeped my soul, so to speak. It has been a priceless experience–and I am glad it is not over. What I would have missed if I had ended everything last summer!

On September 8th, 1933, Everett was stung by bees at least a dozen times in addition to already being covered in poison oak blisters. In his attempt to escape the bees, he fell into Goddard Creek, but was in so much pain and was feeling so lethargic that he struggled to find the strength to pull himself out of the water and nearly drowned. 

However, by 1934 and particularly in the weeks leading up to his disappearance, he was seemingly in very good spirits and doing better than ever before. In his letters to his parents, he spoke of having “great fun” with the locals and even alluded to having come into quite a bit of cash recently (though he never elaborated on the source of this money) and stated that he now had “more money than I need”. Also, for the first time ever, he sent money home to help his parents out. 

**Disappearance**

On November 21st, 1934, two sheepherders named Addlin Lay and Clayton Porter, encountered Everett on the Hole-in-the-Rock trail, where they were camping. According to them, they offered Everett a quarter of mutton, but he declined, saying that he had plenty of food. They then watched as Everett and his burros, Cockleburrs and Chocolatero, made their way southeast, towards Davis Gulch. This was the last time anyone is known to have seen Everett Ruess. 

Though almost two months had gone by since Everett’s family had heard from him, they didn’t think much of it to begin with, as Everett had warned them back in the fall that he may not be near a post office for a month or two. However, by late January they were becoming concerned. Their alarm only heightened when they received their own letters to Everett back in the mail, the envelopes still sealed. They began writing letters to every postmaster in every town in the southwest that Everett was known to have visited. When this yielded no answers as to where their son was, they started writing to sheriffs, traders, newspapers, radio stations, and Indian agents. But no one had seen Everett in months or knew anything of his current whereabouts.

**The Search**

Finally, on March 1st, months after that last sighting back in November, a search party was formed. A man named Jennings Allen, along with a dozen other local men, headed into Davis Gulch on horseback hoping to find some sign of Everett or what had become of him. They turned up nothing until March 6th, when they found Cockleburrs and Chocolatero, Everett’s burros, in a corral. There are discrepancies in the accounts of the searchers as to the condition these burros were found in though, with some claiming that they were “thin and emaciated”, while others said that they were “fat and healthy”. 

Nearby, in a natural alcove, they found what was presumed to have been Everett’s final campsite. There were footprints, Anasazi potsherds, candy wrappers, empty cans and an impression in the dirt from a bedroll. Notably absent from this site were Everett’s money, camping gear, cooking equipment, paintings and art supplies, and his 1934 journal. They also discovered two different spots in Davis Gulch where “Nemo 1934” had been etched into the rock. “Nemo”, Latin for “nobody”, is a pseudonym that Everett was known to have adopted and so it is assumed that he’s the one who made these inscriptions. Both inscriptions are now under water and have been since 1957, when the waters of Lake Powell rose during the construction of Glen Canyon Dam.

Beyond this, nothing more would ever be found that would shed light on what happened to Everett Ruess.

**Additional Information**

* There was a rumor in Escalante, a nearby town, that Everett had been robbed and murdered by local cattle rustlers who mistook him for a government agent. By 1934, cattle rustling was becoming rampant in this area and due to this, the Cattlemen’s Association spread a false rumor that an undercover government investigator had been sent out to the area. As the story goes, Everett arrived in town shortly thereafter.

* A Navajo man named Aneth Nez told his granddaughter (Daisy) a story in 1971 about witnessing a young white man being chased and then murdered by Ute Indians near Comb Ridge in the mid-1930’s. After the Utes left, Nez buried the body. Remains were eventually found in that area, but DNA testing confirmed that they did not belong to Everett. 

* In the 1970’s, a tourist found bones wedged in a crack in Davis Gulch. The bones seemed to indicate that the person had suffered a broken hip and a fractured collar bone. He turned over the bones to a National Park Service ranger, who in turn gave them to his supervisor. However, shortly after this the bones went missing and have never been found.

**Theories**

* Accidental death, perhaps due to a fall or drowning.

* Murder

* Suicide

**\*TW: SUICIDE, LARVAE AND RAZORS ARE MENTIONED\***  


I apologize in advance for the lack of information since there's only one thread in a Swedish forum, one podcast episode and one paywalled Swedish article about this.  


[Upphittat lik Esrange 1979.](https://www.flashback.org/t1000184p1)  
[Mysteriet: Vem var den döde mannen?](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/8wXq7x/vem-var-den-dode-mannen)  
[Den döde ingen saknar – Besynnerliga Berättelser – Lyssna här](https://podtail.se/podcast/besynnerliga-berattelser/den-dode-ingen-saknar/)  
(his police sketch is used in the thumbnail for the podcast, it cannot be found anywhere else on the internet)  


43 years ago, 20-25 kilometres (15 miles) from Kiruna and 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the nearest town a man's body was found deep in the woods near space base Esrange.  
This was deep into the forest, there were no actual roads around there and it was impossible to get around without a vehicle.  
During this season the ice had started to melt as well so you couldn't cross any rivers, etc.  


There are conflicting statements as to who found the body, the newspaper says:  


&gt;*A road worker knew that something was wrong when he saw footprints along the newly built forest road.*  
*Who had been walking around there? This was not a place where people walked around on foot.*  
*The police were called on June 11th 1979, they started following the footsteps for a few kilometres and then they found him.*

The podcast has a snippet of a radio rapport from 1979 where they say that two fishermen found the body on June 12th 1979.  


The man had long blond/light brown hair, 177 cm tall (5'9""), except for his period-appropriate sideburns, he was clean-shaven.  
Eye colour could not be determined due to decomposition. It is estimated that he was there for about a month, there was fly/larvae activity on the body.  
One of his front teeth were knocked out.  
He was dressed in cowboy boots, jeans, an anorak shirt, six t-shirts and a blue windbreaker which is very unusual since it gets very cold during the spring nights in Kiruna.  
In his left jean pocket, there was both Swedish and Danish currency.  
In total, he had 134 SEK (14 dollars).  


Beside the body were the remnants of a campfire, bloody teabags, a bloody toilet-roll, a glass, a coffee pot, two broken matchboxes, a strong rope that was 5 mm (0,1 inches) broad 6,5 metres (21 feet) long, burned blue finger gloves, some sugar and a pack of band-aids.  
The man had no ID or other papers that could help with the identification.  
The police were shocked because people that hike there aren't usually poorly equipped especially when they hike as long as he did.  


When they moved his body upside down there was a white box with Gillette razor blades in it. Two of them were used, and on the white box, there were bloodstains.  
The box was found on the ground under the left hip.  
On the right wrist, there was a cut about 5 cm (almost 2 inches) long and 1 cm (0,3 inches) wide. There were cuts on the left arm as well.  
The cuts were too superficial to cause his death.  
The coroner determined that he had died of hypothermia.  
It's estimated that he was closer to the younger end of the age range.  
There were no signs of foul play.  
He was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  


Conflicting information again.  
According to the article, there were no cars around the area and no one came forward about giving the man a lift despite the case being highly publicised.  
A policeman said: ""If he had not walked there, perhaps all the way from Kiruna, someone would've noticed him. People are very vigilant in these areas and it's quite noticeable if someone is walking there along the way but no one had seen the man"".  


The podcast says that some people thought they saw him and that a couple had offered the walking man a ride to which he just answered ""go"" (as in ""get away from me"").  
They thought that something was up because he was hiking without a backpack, just two bags.  
The man had told people that he was from Switzerland and that he was going to be a doctor in that he hadn’t gotten his license yet.  
He spoke with an accent and broken Swedish but people could understand him.  
But sadly, when the couple was shown a picture of the man, despite the decomposition, they said that it wasn't him that they tried to pick up and the cops are back to square one.  


Sometime later a weird letter is left at the train station in Kiruna, addressed to a wanderer that we can call ""Mr Koch"" that back then didn't have an address.  
The train station employees leave it to Swedish authorities and they start following up on the letter. Could the unidentified man be ""Mr Koch""?  
After an investigation, they find out that ""Mr Koch"" is alive and well in another European country.  
He had simply gone home and forgotten the letter.  


According to the article fingerprints and descriptions (probably of the body and crime scene) were sent to Interpol and then to police in Norway, Finland and Denmark.  
The man got cremated, the things around the body were thrown out and the case got closed since they determined that there was no foul play.  
The only thing left is a folder with papers.  


Could the man have been a spy since he was found near the only space base in Sweden (highly unlikely)? Could the man have been the swiss man the couple had offered a ride to? Could he just have been a depressed man that tried to kill himself and the family hasn't made a connection yet?  
So many questions are left unanswered.  


I personally tend to believe that the fishermen found him since that is said in the police report.  
I also do find it odd that a swiss man was seen in the area around that time and was never seen again, maybe he just changed clothes and burned the other ones since there had been a campfire there? Maybe that's why the couple said it wasn't the man they saw?",UnresolvedMysteries,"John Doe, Kiruna, Sweden, 1979",0

39,Afraid-Emotion-5102,1642546733,"Barbara Walsh was a married mother of 7 children, aged 33, who lived on rural County Galway, Ireland (Rusheenamanagh, near Carna), at the time of her disappearance.

The last recorded sighting of her was on June 22nd 1985.

The night before, there was a party, where up to a dozen people were present, including two members of the Gardai and a priest.

The party had initially been in a local bar, and ended up back at the Barbara and Dara's house, as Barbara's husbands siblings, Catherine and Patrick, were back home from the USA and Australia respectively, and were having one last meet up before leaving.

One of her teenage daughters got up at 4am on the 22nd June, and remembers seeing her mother sleeping on the sofa, and put a pillow under her head. Barbaras daughter went back to bed after that.

This was the last confirmed sighting of Barbara. When the morning came, Barbara was gone - when they got up, they presumed she went with their father down to the local shops.

When their father Dara returned by himself, they realised that she was missing - a search was begun, but she never turned up.

The police believe that the answers lie in the local gaeltacht community there.

The evidence suggests that Barbara is no longer alive, and going by the interviews that family members have given, they feel its extremely unlikely that she would've walked out on her family.

It seems that many more searches have been done in recent years, but unfortunately no real progress has been made.

Investigators say the victim had skeletal asymmetry that, in life, may have been visible in her facial features.

Additionally, she may have experienced issues with her neck.

The sheriff’s office investigated the victim’s homicide and has worked to identify her for nearly three decades.

They said, recently, new ways of identification for “Ina Jane Doe” have been tried, including anthropological re-analysis from University of New Hampshire assistant professor Dr. Amy Michael, DNA extraction and sequencing by Astrea Labs, and forensic genetic genealogy by Redgrave Research Forensic Services.

JEFFERSON COUNTY (WSIL) -- The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is renewing their efforts to identify the victim from a murder 29-years ago.

On January 27, 1993, the decapitated head of a presumed white female was discovered on the side of a wooded roadway within Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park in Jefferson County. 

The victim, estimated to have been 30-50 years old at the time of her death, had likely died 2-3 days prior to discovery.

She had long, reddish hair and a pin-shaped mole in her left ear. She'd had extensive dental work, including a silver point filling and she had possibly worn braces at some point. The victim had skeletal asymmetry that, in life, may have been visible in her facial features. Additionally, she may have experienced issues with her neck.

The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office has investigated the victim’s homicide and worked to identify her for nearly three decades.

Recently, new avenues of identification for ""Ina Jane Doe,"" have been pursued, including anthropological re-analysis from University of New Hampshire assistant professor Dr. Amy Michael, DNA extraction and sequencing by Astrea Labs, and forensic genetic genealogy by Redgrave Research Forensic Services.

[Beverly Ozuna-Ulrich](https://uncovered.com/cases/beverly-ann-ozuna-ulrich), the mother of eight children, was living in Belle Fourche, South Dakota in 2003. A small town of less than 6,000 residents, Belle Forche is about 13 miles from the Wyoming border. A member of the Lakota tribe, Beverly was the youngest of 16 siblings in a large, close-knit family. 

Roughly 14 months [before Beverly disappeared, she had separated from her husband](https://charleyproject.org/case/beverly-ann-ozuna-ulrich). However, she would regularly return to the home to cook and clean for the children. Beverely was last seen leaving her South Dakota home on October 17, 2003 by her estranged husband, Steven. Ten days later on October 27, 2003, her family would report her missing. While Beverly was known to travel unannounced from time to time, she always kept in close contact with her children and her siblings. 

**Two major leads.** In February 2004, authorities were [alerted to a body](https://www.bhpioneer.com/local_news/family-of-missing-belle-fourche-woman-still-searching-after-14-years/article_5bf148ce-b999-11e7-b03a-d31e5a143208.html) that was found along Interstate 90 in South Dakota. Believed to be Beverely, DNA would prove it was another woman who was never publicly identified. Then, in October 2008, five years after she disappeared, [a tip was called in to the Belle Forche Police Department](https://rapidcityjournal.com/news/vigil-planned-for-belle-fourche-woman-missing-since-2003/article_5f6ae20a-f481-11e0-b4ce-001cc4c03286.html) which resulted in a canine-led search of a 20-acre site on the outskirts of the city, but there was no sign of Beverely. 

**What we know about Beverly’s case today.** With little left to go on in her case, investigators and family members believe it is likely that Beverely is deceased. However, they still hold annual vigils in hopes to find out what happened. If you have any information regarding Beverely’s case, please contact the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation at 605-391-6661.

Unfortunately, Beverly is one of the numerous indigenous women who go missing or are murdered throughout the US. Recently, the [formation of a new unit dedicated to missing &amp; murdered indigenous people](https://www.doi.gov/news/secretary-haaland-creates-new-missing-murdered-unit-pursue-justice-missing-or-murdered-american) was enacted within the Bureau of Indian Affairs by Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland to increase resources and cooperation related to cases involving missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives.

The Monkey Man of New Delhi was an ape like creature that terrorized the capital city of New Delhi, India in 2001.

In May of that year, stories began to circulate in New Delhi of a strange, nocturnal, monkey-like creature that was attacking people. Eyewitness accounts were often inconsistent, but tended to describe the creature as about four feet (120 cm) tall, covered in thick black hair. It supposedly wore a metal helmet, had metal claws, pants, glowing red eyes (sometimes beneath goggles) and three buttons on its chest. Some suggest the Monkey Man is an avatar of the Hindu deity Hanuman, while others claim it is a version of Bigfoot.

Many people reported being scratched, and two (by some reports, three) people even died when they leapt from the tops of buildings or fell down stairwells in a panic caused by the Monkey Man. Eventually, police even issued artist impressions in an attempt to catch the creature.

Shining a bright light in the Monkey Man's face was said to ward him off, as it renders his ""night vision glasses"" ineffective. It was also thought that throwing water on the simian's chest would short-circuit his ""motherboard heart."" In similar fashion, it was believed that the creature could turn invisible with the press of one button on his panel. These theories portray the Monkey Man as something more mechanical than natural.

**Beatriz Joana Von Hohendorff Winck** was 77 years old, she lived in the city of *Portão*, South of Brazil, with her husband Delmar. The couple, who had four children, had been together for about 60 years. One of their favorite activities was participating in excursions.

In October 2012, Beatriz and Delmar went to Aparecida on an excursion with more than 30 people. Before traveling, Beatriz had a check-up and the doctor stated she had no health problems. Her family assumes she was fit to travel. *She didn't have Alzheimer's or any disease that left her with memory lapses*.

**THE PLACE OF DISAPPEARANCE**

The Catedral Basilica Santuário Nacional de Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida, known as ‘Santuário de Aparecida’ is a Catholic religious temple located in the Brazilian municipality of Aparecida, inside the state of São Paulo. It is the largest Catholic temple in Brazil and the second largest in the world, only smaller than the Basilica of Saint Peter, in the Vatican. Aparecida receives around 1 million visitors per month.

[Aparecida's Sanctuary](https://imagens.ebc.com.br/nXP0kPvWgEWceemqGJBPzeG91JA=/1170x700/smart/https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/basilica_of_the_national_shrine_of_our_lady_of_aparecida_2007.jpg?itok=7CiMXyIt)

**The day Beatriz vanished**

When they arrived, Delmar and Beatriz went to the hotel, dropped off their things and went to take a walk around the city. They took a tour of the Sanctuary, which on that day had many visitors. During this tour, they decided to enter a store called ‘Casa das Velas’ which sells religious items inside the Basilica.

“They chose the candles they wanted and headed towards the cashier. But as there was a line, my father asked my mother to wait at the store's exit door, because he would get in line and pay. He saw my mother standing outside, waiting. When it was his turn, he paid and left, but he couldn't find my mother anymore"", says their eldest son, João.

Delmar tried to find his wife, then he spoke to one of the temple’s guards and spoke to acquaintances who took the tour inside the Basilica with them. One of the elderly women said that Beatriz complained of being tired and said she would ""go home"". However, João does not believe that Beatriz has left the sanctuary.

""She wouldn't go to the bathroom without telling my dad. He wouldn't do anything without my mom either. They were very close. When my dad told her to wait outside the store, I'm sure she stood there waiting, but disappeared for some reason"", says João.

Delmar then looked for his wife at the hotel. Only at the beginning of the night did he contact his children to inform them about the disappearance. João took a flight to Aparecida and registered a police report the next day.

**Searches**

The day after the disappearance, João began to lead the search. “We made pamphlets and distributed them in hospitals, nursing homes, under the bridge and everywhere you can imagine within a 100 km radius of Aparecida”. Beatriz’s son even talked to a drug dealer of the region in hopes of finding any clues.

The Sanctuary of Aparecida reported that there were no records that could show the moment when Beatriz disappeared. ""We only got access to the Sanctuary's cameras after 15 days of her disappearance. And that didn't help us at all, because we discovered that the filming there was made one on top of the other. So, nothing was recorded"", explained João.

Some hypotheses about Beatriz's disappearance were raised. First, that she could have gotten lost in the city, boarded another tour bus, or decided to return to her family home in Portão. Over time, however, all were discarded.

Regarding the possibility of kidnapping, the lack of a ransom demand discourages the hypothesis, and there are no indications of any other crime.

Nine years have passed and no one knows where Mrs. Beatriz might have went. If she’s still alive she’s 86 years old. Her son travelled around the country to see elderly women in hospitals and homes but none of them turned out to be his mother. Human bones found in the region sometime later were also ruled out.

Her family is still looking for answers and her son believes she’s still alive. This is a website dedicated to finding Mrs. Beatriz: [http://www.ondeestadonabeatriz.com.br/](http://www.ondeestadonabeatriz.com.br/)

56,ThisICannotForgive,1642473775,"Tuesday night, Miami-Dade Police Cold Case detectives announced they had solved and closed the brazen kidnapping and murder 55 years ago of Danny Goldman, a 17-year-old banker’s son from Surfside. For a group of his friends and a former mayor of the city where the crime occurred, it was a “Mission Accomplished” moment. Outside of the collapse of the Champlain Towers South in June, the Goldman kidnapping in 1966 was the biggest story to hit sleepy Surfside. Most South Floridians likely have no idea who Goldman was or his horrible end. 

But one local attorney and a group of five Miami Beach High grads who knew Goldman from school and the neighborhood could not forget about the case that shook up their the years of their youth. They became volunteer sleuths and worked the case for 10 years, uncovering a Mafia connection and much more. Impressive work. And homicide detectives agreed. In a video clip, Miami-Dade Det. Jonathan Grossman of the cold-case unit said that, while working the case, they contacted the lead volunteer sleuth, attorney Paul Novack, a former Surfside mayor, and the “volunteer investigation team,” as Novack calls them. They “provided critical information” that helped identify a man named George Defeis as Goldman’s kidnapper. Defeis is long dead. A partial fingerprint, a handicapped gait to his walk and the taxi he took to the crime scene all helped build a case against Defeis years later, Goodman explained in the video. And the group of friends — Novack, along with Anthony Blate, David and Joe Graubart and Harvey Lisker — unearthed a startling revelation.

 According to the sleuth team, Goldman’s abduction was a retaliation murder, a Mafia hit, made to look like a kidnapping. It had nothing to do with ransom money and everything to do with Goldman’s father testifying days before the kidnapping in front of a federal grand jury in Miami about fraud at a bank where the elder Goldman was on the board of directors. The Miami Debate Novack said some involved with the fraud at the bank had ties to Meyer Lansky, Santo Trafficante Jr., Joe Cacciatore and Jimmy Hoffa, all who had connections to South Florida at the time. Defeis was linked to the Trafficante organization, the volunteer sleuths determined by poring through documents, interviewing relatives and friends and chasing leads that detectives back then had ignored. “We uncovered an enormous amount of hidden information. This case has tentacles like you would not believe,” Novack told the Editorial Board. Among the findings is that corrupt sheriffs, with links to organized crime, may have “lost” evidence in the case. 

So why the interest in the kidnapping of Danny Goldman? Novack says he was 8 years old and also living in Surfside when Danny was kidnapped. “The crime affected the entire community. No one locked their doors before this happened,” he said. That changed because the Goldman kidnapper entered the home at 4:30 a.m. through an unlocked sliding glass door. He tied up Aaron and Sally Goldman, dragged Danny out and told the parents he wanted $50,000 and would be calling them later in the day. No call ever came. Danny’s body was never found, but the theory is that his body was dismembered and dumped in the ocean. No arrests were made. Both Goldman parents have since died. Novack and the volunteer sleuths kept the case alive and shared their findings to cold-case detectives. This was a gratifying team effort. Volunteer sleuths were tenacious, and cold-case detectives listened. The result is some justice for Danny Goldman.

58,PrimeVector19,1642464961,"On November 17, 2003, at 6:30 pm, Matthew Colter was seen for the last time before he disappeared. 

The last person to see Colter alive was his sister, who had said he was acting oddly at the time - which is a telling sign being that Colter was schizophrenic. Yet, the circumstances surrounding his disappearance may rival his behavior at the time he vanished. 

Colter’s last known whereabouts begin and end at his residence in the 1100 block of Erika Road in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

Colter’s sister went to his home the following day, and she saw some… uncanny things, to say the least. 

Colter’s door was unlocked; there were pry marks on the door, some appliances were damaged, and someone had even defecated on the floor. There was no sign of Colter at the scene, and he has not been heard from. 

There were some reported sightings of Colter in the days subsequent to his disappearance, but none of the accounts were verified. Foul play is suspected. 

Could Colter have been lured out of his home? Could be have disappeared by his own volition? Was the unsettling scenery at his home a foreboding sign? 

It seems to me that this case - like many - has been thoroughly disregarded by authorities, and it has not gained much attention. 

Matthew Colter is a black male who was 46 years old at the time of his disappearance. He is 6’0, 160 pounds. He wears glasses. Colter suffers from schizophrenia, and needs medication - which he did not have with him when he disappeared. He may be a danger to himself.

60,Main_Initiative,1642460397,"**One of the most covered unsolved cases in a college town, the disappearance of Lauren Spierer at Indiana University is still cold 10 years later.**  

[Lauren Spierer](https://uncovered.com/cases/lauren-spierer) was a junior at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, studying apparel merchandising in 2011. A native of Scarsdale, New York, Lauren had a tight group of friends on and off campus. That makes her now-10-year disappearance even more baffling.

Lauren's case has received a lot of media attention since she went missing, including national coverage from the likes of Nancy Grace and People Magazine. But there are still so many unresolved questions from that night, including the biggest—*where is Lauren?* 

**The day Lauren went missing.** On the late evening of June 2nd, 2011, [Lauren was seen leaving her apartment](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled) with a friend, David Rohn. The two went to another mutual friend’s apartment, Jay Rosenbaum. Lauren, David and Jay had plans to meet up with Jay’s neighbor, Corey Rossman. There were approximately 10 people at Corey’s apartment with [reports of heavy drinking and drug use.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/lauren-spierer-case-years-vanished-hope/story?id=40084230) By midnight, David heads back to his apartment at Smallwoods Plaza and per surveillance footage, he isn’t seen leaving the apartment again around 11AM the next morning. 

[By 1:46AM, Lauren goes to Kilroy Sports Bar](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled) and is later seen leaving the bar with Corey Rossman by 2:27AM. Lauren leaves behind her shoes at the bar because the bar has a sand- covered patio. After leaving the bar, there is a lot of back and forth from various friends homes before she is last seen: 

* By 2:30AM Lauren and Corey are seen at Smallwood Plaza but are confronted by Zach Oates, and 3 others who are concerned about Lauren. [Zach Oates and Corey have a verbal altercation before Zach punches Corey in the face. ](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled)
* Lauren and Corey leave Smallwood Plaza. A security camera shows Laurnen and Corey exiting the alley near Smallwood at[ 2:51AM and walking toward the 5 North Townhomes](https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-and-opinion/crime/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled)–where mutual friends live.
* When they return back to Smallwood Plaza, at Corey’s apartment where his room tries to convince Lauren to sleep over instead of walking back to her apartment, she refuses. 
* Lauren then heads over to Jay’s apartment next door by 4:15AM, where she borrows Jay’s phone to call David and another unidentified friend, but neither of them pick up the phone. By 4:30AM on June 3, 2011, Jay says he last saw Lauren at the intersection of 11th Street and College Ave, headed south on College Ave.; barefoot, wearing black leggings and a white shirt she was last seen barefoot, wearing black leggings and a white shirt.

**When she was reported missing.** By the afternoon of June 3, Lauren’s boyfriend tries to get in contact with her, but is contacted by an employee of Kilroy’s Sports Bar to let him know that Lauren left her phone there. Lauren’s roommate meets up with her boyfriend to try to find Lauren. Her friends called to report her missing to the Bloomington Police Department shortly after that. Lauren’s sister, Rebecca calls around to family to let them know that Lauren has been reported missing. Lauen’s mother, Charlene, starts calling local hospitals while her father, Robert, calls her boyfriend, [who is at the police station. Lauren’s parents arrive in Bloomington the very next day.](https://uncovered.com/cases/lauren-spierer) 

Three days later, the community gathered to search for Lauren throughout the Bloomington area including Smallwood Plaza—where she was last seen. Two days later, police reveal that there are 10 people of interest. Volunteers continue to coordinate search efforts but there is no sign of Lauren. 

**Where the case stands today.** Lauren’s family is still searching for her. Shortly after she went missing, Lauren was featured in a segment of “America’s Most Wanted” which brought in 350 tips but unfortunately no breakthroughs in the case. [National pleas from celebrities](https://nypost.com/2011/06/08/star-search-3/) such as Denise Richards and Donnie Wahlberg were made for anyone with information to come forward. Last year, a TikTok surfaced to say they had information on her disappearance. While nothing credible was found, Lauren’s mom shared that she forwards all leads to authorities in hopes that one will lead to answers.

WIth so much construction in a college town, the area where Lauren disappeared is almost unrecognizable from 10 years ago. Did you attend Indiana University in 2011? Did you see someone matching her description the early morning of June 3 at the corner of 11th Street and College Ave?

If you have any information regarding Lauren’s disappearance please contact policetips@bloomington.in.gov,  Bloomington Police Department at 812-339-4477, or Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317-262-TIPS.

61,jordenjorden11,1642444307,"Simon de Vries is a 21-year old Dutch student. By all accounts, Simon comes from a normal family, was not known to be depressed and had never run away from home. He was studying a degree in Industrial Product Design in The Hague, Netherlands. Although he had mentioned that he wanted to stop his studies, a month before his disappearance, he had still paid the tuition for the coming school year.

Saturday, October 3, 2020: Simon is spending his school holiday in his hometown Heerhugowaard, in the north of the country. He finished working his shift at Action, a discount store. He then ate dinner at home. In the evening, he left home with a cooler of beer, to meet with friends for a drink. According to his parents, he was in a cheerful mood. Because of corona restrictions, the group of friends decides to split up into two groups instead of meeting altogether, and therefore no one notices that Simon is actually never seen that evening. One group thinks he is with the other group and vice versa.

His parents only find out the next morning on Sunday that he is not at home. He hasn't sent a message and his bike isn't there either. Normally Simon would always be communicative. His father is worried, but can't get hold of Simon. His friends don't know where he is either. Via an old phone from Simon, his father finds out that his son checked in on Saturday evening at Hotel Bastion in Maastricht. That would be a very long 3-4 hour journey from his hometown, with no direct train, and Simon had no reason to go there. The father calls the police and decides to travel there himself.

Police did indeed locate Simon at the hotel. They speak with him for a long time, but do not notice anything suspicious. Simon claimed he just wanted a weekend away. When his father arrives some time later, Simon tells him the same. His father tries to persuade him to go home, but Simon wants to relax and promises to be home the following Wednesday. When asked why he chose to go to Maastricht, Simon said that was the furthest place he is allowed go during corona restrictions (Maastricht is at the far south of the country). He also says he will keep his mother informed. But he would never keep either promise. After Simon left the hotel around noon the next day, all traces are missing.

After a few days, Simon is no longer heard from, his father decides to call in the police again. But because Simon is an adult and the police previously spoke to him in good health just before that, no action is taken.

After two weeks, the police conduct an investigation which shows that Simon has no longer withdrawn any money from his bank account and also does not have a passport with him. To the frustration of the family, Dutch authorities does not give permission to trace his phone. He no longer uses his phone, but the device can be traced via the IMEI number. But tracing is not allowed, because there is no indication of a crime committed. It also becomes clear that Simon has not used his public transport student card. He doesn't have a car, but he does have a driver's license. His bicycle is also missing. Simon may have had at most 100 euros with him.

The police have added him to the register of missing persons, as an ""unexplained disappearance"".

The parents elaborated more about Simon's mental state. They said Simon was an active person, however due to the corona restrictions, he was spending more time indoors at his laptop. Simon's mother did remark that Simon had earlier asked ""can someone's location be tracked if they use their bank card?"". The parents have two scenarios in mind. First, Simon could have left for a warmer country. Second, Simon was not happy and his mother has ""doubt if he is still alive today"".

70,mintwolves,1642415699," Ike Ibeabuchi abducted his estranged girlfriend's 15-year-old son one night in 1997 and was driving along the Interstate 35 in Austin with him in the car when he decided to ram it into a concrete pillar in an attempt to both their lives. 

Ibeabuchi was only 24, an undefeated heavyweight boxer in the prime of his career, but who was slowly being consumed by his inner demons. As he was dragged away from the wreckage, covered in blood and dust, wide-eyed and delirious, he thought he had ended his nightmare.

It had only been a couple of months since he outgunned David Tua in an epic fight that still boasts the record for most punches thrown in a heavyweight contest (1,730). The win had catapulted him into contention for a world title fight.

The teenage boy in the passenger seat of Ibeabuchi's car suffered severe injuries and would never walk the same again. Ibeabuchi was sentenced to just 120 days in jail for false imprisonment and forced to pay $500,000 in a civil settlement.

Upon his release from prison Ibeabuchi returned to the ring the following year, picking up two easy knockout wins over Tim Ray and Everton Davis.

Then on March 20, 1999, Ibeabuchi truly announced himself into boxing's mainstream with a vicious knockout victory over Olympic silver medallist Chris Byrd.

Now 20-0 it seemed inevitable that would go one to fight for the heavyweight title but this would never happen.

Ibeabuchi's mental health was deteriorating 'President' persona was getting out of hand. At times when he was being churlish or refusing to complete a simple requirement such as attending a weigh-in, his handlers would appeal to 'The President's' regal nature by convincing him it was the noble thing to do. ""There were times when he thought he was really a president"", boxing promoter and former [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO) Sports executive Lou DiBella said. ""He would get into these mental states where he insisted on people calling him 'The President'. It was his alter ego, where 'I am The President,' not of the United States, but President of the world.""

Once, Ibeabuchi wielded a knife during a dinner meeting in New York to discuss a possible three fight HBO deal. ""We were having a fine meal at a nice restaurant"", Promoter Cedric Kushner said, ""and mid-course Ike picked up a big carving knife, slammed it into the table and screamed 'They knew it! They knew it! The belts belong to me! Why don't they just give them back?'"" ""That was a peculiar experience"", Kushner said. ""That wasn't the type of conduct I expected to romance the guy from HBO. He (Ibeabuchi) was like a Viking.""

In July 1999, Ibeabuchi was staying at The Mirage Hotel and Casinoi in Vegas when he phoned a local escort service and had a woman sent to his room. The 21-year-old woman said later she was there to strip and nothing else. She claimed Ibeabuchi attacked her after she demanded to be paid up front. Ibeabuchi barricaded himself in the bathroom and police discharged pepper spray under the door until he surrendered.

Ibeabuchi's legal defense faced the further difficulty of the Clark County DA's reopening of a similar sexual assault allegation against him from eight months earlier which took place at another hotel. Ibeabuchi was released on bail and placed under house arrest, able to train and fight again until his trial. He was remanded after two more similar allegations surfaced from Arizona.

Ibeabuchi was deemed incompetent to stand trial and was sent to a state facility. Medical experts concluded he exhibited bipolar disorder and a judge granted permission to force-medicate him. Eight months later, TWO AND A HALF YEARS after his arrest, he was ruled cogent enough to plea.

Ibeabuchi subsequently entered an Alford Plea, pleading guilty while not admitting guilt to avoid going to trial. Ibeabuchi was sentenced to two to ten years for battery with intent to commit a crime (from which he was later paroled), and three to 20 years for attempted Sexual Assault, with the sentences to be served consecutively.

While incarcerated, Ibeabuchi earned three college associate degrees in General Studies, Business, and Management. He also earned a paralegal certificate by correspondence from Blackstone Career Institute in Allentown, Pennsylvania. His Las Vegas conviction was overturned by the Nevada Supreme Court in 2007 and he was expected to be released, but the lower courts abandoned the ruling. The Nevada Supreme Court subsequently affirmed its earlier ruling of its overturning of Ibeabuchi's Las Vegas conviction again, and Ibeabuchi's Nevada conviction was eventually overturned, vacated (cleared as innocent) and discharged.

THE RELEASE &amp; PLANNED COMEBACK

Ibeabuchi completed his sentence in the Nevada Department of Corrections. Prior to this, Ibeabuchi was moved to the Washoe County Jail on February 28, 2014, and then he was transferred by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Eloy Detention Centre in Eloy, Arizona.

Ibeabuchi was released by USCIS in November 2015 as a free man when Nigeria declined to provide travel documents. Ibeabuchi enlisted the help of Mike Koncz, an adviser of Manny Pacquiao, in an attempt to make a boxing comeback. In good health, Ibeabuchi hoped to fight his first comeback bout in the near future, but he was waiting to resolve his immigration and United States citizenship status with USCIS first. He holds a green card and his citizenship was pending only the formal swearing in. However, in April 2016, Ibeabuchi was arrested for violating the conditions of his probation in Gilbert, Arizona, based on an old warrant dating back to 2003 that he claimed to be unaware of.

Ibeabuchi was released on September 23, 2020, from the Arizona State penal system after serving required time, and his probationary status was overturned on appeal. He was thought to be being held at the United States Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) in Eloy, Arizona, during the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus period until his swearing in ceremony and the formal awarding of U.S. citizenship can be scheduled, either while in detainee custody or after final release.

but....

WHERE IS IKE IBEABUCHI NOW ?

Here is some info from Luke G. Williams (the author of 'The President Of Pandemonium' the biography on Ike Ibeabuchi) 

"" Rumours that former heavyweight contender Ike Ibeabuchi had been released from prison first surfaced in Feb 2014. Actually he had been transferred to ICE custody .

After appearing before an immigration judge, an order was made to deport Ibeabuchi back to Nigeria. But his homeland refused to issue travel documents for his return.

With Nigeria unwilling to take him back, in November 2015 Ibeabuchi was freed from ICE and returned to everyday life in Arizona.

While a free man again, Ibeabuchi began training for a comeback fight. With Michael Koncz as his advisor, a possible showdown was even mooted with Andy Ruiz Jr, then a 25-0 contender on the Pacquiao vs Bradley undercard. Ike was in pretty good physical shape too.

In Feb 2016 I spoke to Ike Ibeabuchi by telephone and corresponded via email. He was excited about his comeback and told me: “I have unfinished business in boxing. I have to redeem myself. I want to be a world champion before day turns to dusk.""

However as part of ‘Operation Justice’ in Arizona, Ibeabuchi was re-arrested on 7 April 2016 for failing the terms of his probation. A further 3 1/2 year sentence was imposed, with 505 days of time served applied.

On 23 September 2020 Ibeabuchi was released from prison but once again returned to ICE custody at Eloy, Arizona (pictured). When my book was completed Ike’s future was unclear. So what has happened in the months since ?

First of all ICE’s Eloy facility had serious Covid issues, It seems Ike just had to stay put for a while.

Then, sometime between April and 11 August 2021, Ibeabuchi’s name no longer appeared in the ICE detainee locator database. What this meant was either a: he had DIED b: he had been released back into the USA or c: he had been deported to Nigeria. ICE wouldn’t say what happened…

Until last week ( posted 29th October 2021) Ike Ibeabuchi’s whereabouts were unclear. But I now understand that he was indeed deported back to Nigeria and at one point was being held and his case processed in the Nigeria Immigration Service in Abuja.

**Questions Remain**. Is Ibeabuchi still in Nigerian immigration custody or is he finally free again? ""

If Ike is free surely he would have made contact with his advisor, management or boxing media like he did on his 2014 release? and how can one man be detained for such a long time after his sentence has been served? At 49 years old is Ike's career in boxing finally over ?

73,PrincessNutNut,1642407959,"Shannan Gilbert’s grave in Amityville cemetery lies eight miles from where she went missing in May 2011 after visiting a client at Oak Beach, a spit of sand dotted with holiday homes on New York’s Long Island, three miles short of Gilgo Beach, where her remains were found eight months later.

Gilbert’s final resting place, with a simple headstone at the back of the cemetery inscribed with her dates – 24 October 1986 – 13 December 2011 – speaks to an enduring mystery of how she, along with 10 or more other women, mostly sex workers who advertised on Craigslist, ended up dead along the same stretch of scrubby barrier marshes more than a decade ago.

13 December is not the date Gilbert went missing. A year and seven months earlier – 1 May 2010 – she’d made a frantic 22-minute call to 911 from the area and reportedly said: “They are trying to kill me.” She knocked on two neighbor’s doors, before disappearing back into the night. Three other 911 calls were made that night. One call was from Gilbert’s client Joseph Brewer and two were from the neighbors.

During the search for Gilbert, police found four more sets of remains later identified as Melissa Barthelemy, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Megan Waterman, and Amber Lynn Costello. The Gilgo Four, as they became known, had been discarded in a similar fashion, 500ft apart, each swathed or covered in burlap sack cloth.

Six more bodies were found in the same area at about the same time. Their dates of death, too, speak to the uncertainty that pervades the case of the Long Island serial killer. Police initially said they believed Gilbert drowned by accident, which few believed, and a medical examiner’s autopsy proved inconclusive.

In the 11 years since, Gilgo Beach has become synonymous with violent death and law enforcement failures rooted in incompetence or, worse, institutional disregard. But now, it seems, concrete steps are finally being taken to try to solve the mystery once more.

Last week Rodney Harrison, the new police commissioner of Suffolk county, inherited the case – which has become one of the most notorious unsolved crimes in the US. It goes back to 1996, when body parts of the earliest-known victims were found on the shores of Fire Island, a holiday destination.

It was Harrison who said he would release Gilbert’s 911 call “as long as it doesn’t impede the investigation”. Last week, Harrison went further, saying a ring of people could be possibly connected to the murders. “I’m feeling confident that we’re getting closer to making an arrest,” he told a [local news outlet.](https://pix11.com/news/local-news/long-island/new-suffolk-police-commissioner-plans-on-solving-gilgo-and-inspiring-black-recruits-who-look-like-me/)

If that’s correct, it will have taken Harrison about two weeks to move a case forwards that hadn’t advanced much in 11 years. And that raises several questions, not least why would it require a police commissioner from New York City to get things going.

Among the theories that have circulated was that police did not call in the FBI because they had elements of their own to hide. But Harrison said that linking the Gilgo murder investigation to local police misconduct was a disservice to the investigation. “I can reassure everybody that there’s no coverup in this case,” he said.

According to the Suffolk district attorney, Ray Tierney, who worked with Harrison in Brooklyn, the case is now a firm priority. Tierney has called in FBI investigators as well as running a team of detectives of his own.

“I go into it with no expectations, but there is a voluminous amount of evidence that’s been collected. We’re going to review and go where it leads us,” Tierney told the Guardian. “It matters to the victims’ families and the people of Suffolk county. They want to see it solved.”

But Gilgo Beach residents last week professed a striking level of indifference. “Bad things happen all over, but some make the headlines. Other than gosh, who’d have thought that would happen here, all the talk seems to be coming from people who don’t come from here,” noted one man parked in a pick-up.

The sense that the case has gone cold, and of official indifference over the last 11 years, vexes John Ray, the Gilbert family’s lawyer. Ray has been a consistent advocate for the family’s efforts to find justice for Gilbert, along with the other women who were found along the coastline. 

“Police incompetence, along with certain willful conduct by members of the police department, was a bad mix that destroyed the ability to solve this case,” Ray told the Guardian.

Ray has pursued, through civil litigation and by applying pressure to investigators, a local resident of Oak Beach whom he believes is a prime suspect in Gilbert’s murder and those of the other women found along the beach. The man, a former senior official in the local emergency medical services, made several calls to Gilbert’s mother in the days following Gilbert’s disappearance as well as calls to regional police, her boyfriend, her driver and the client “to learn what he could about Shannan”, Ray has alleged in a civil suit.

Police said initially said Gilbert had probably died accidentally in the marsh behind the man’s house, but that was before they had a body. Later they said she was calm on the 911 call. While Ray is bound by the court to not discuss what he heard on the call, he allows that what police reported “appears to be a deliberate misrepresentation of what happened”.

“It starts to give you pause about what the police’s view of all this was,” he added.

The man later denied his involvement in Gilbert’s disappearance and denied he’d made the calls. “So he did all of these things to try to get serious information. He had no reason to do that if he wasn’t involved,” Ray said.

But other suspects are also in the frame, according to Ray. In essence, murder on this scale takes place in a context of local corruption, Ray said, and that context is what police have been unwilling or unable to expose.

“All of that adds to the problem of defining the circle of guilt. The corruption involved sex and drugs, and these people are involved in either or both of those behaviors. That’s what unites them, but it’s also what makes it so difficult to pin the culprit down because there are so many people with different liabilities.”

Phil Boyle, state senator for Long Island’s fourth district, has asked the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, for an outside investigation of the investigation, believing that figures in the local police force hampered the inquiry and prevented investigators, including the FBI, from looking at cellphone records. “Nobody in their right mind would remove the FBI from a serial killer investigation.”

Where this may lead it is too soon to know.

Melissa Cann, sister of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, told the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/01/10/new-leads-could-finally-solve-gruesome-gilgo-beach-murders/) on Monday she felt hopeful. Lorraine Ela, mother of Megan Waterman, said she had been “kind of skeptical” prior to Harrison’s press conference, but that she now felt the police chief would “work this case with dignity”.

“I am tired of hearing the same crap come out of everyone’s mouth,” she told the outlet via email. “\[But\] I was very pleased with the words from Mr Harrison. He seems to care for the victims.”

Many people involved, on a deep personal level or on a professional level that has become deeply personal, anticipate that a new police chief and district attorney from outside the region, together with FBI, can bring some hope for a resolution to a series of profoundly bleak crimes.

John Ray believes that ultimately the police will identity a suspect and bring charges. But, he cautions, regardless of a conviction, “nobody will believe they are the only killer. The police bungled this case so badly and for so many years, we’ve got a Jack the Ripper situation. It will never be solved even if it is.”

She was between 5'1 and 5'3, of Afro-Caribbean descent. She was dressed smartly and wore distinctive jewelry. In her possession were a handful of items - including an oil painting and a bus pass - yet she has remained unidentified for more than seventeen years.

On Friday, October 29th, 2004, a woman was seen to jump from a rooftop restaurant in the North London area. By the time help arrived, it was too late and she was declared dead.

Police assumed that her identity would be shortly discovered. She jumped from Wembley Point, a building hosting many offices at the time. Perhaps she was one such office worker.

She also had numerous items with her, including:

1. £5.20 in cash
2. a Guardian newspaper for that day
3. a black disposable lighter and a used packet of 10 Marlborough cigarettes 
4. a black carrier bag with clear lettering CPNY
5. a bus pass valid from Oct. 26 to Nov. 1, issued at Seven Sisters Road station, Tottenham, London at 7:07 am
6. an oil painting of, ironically, a woman looking at a faceless figure

**The Carrier Bag**

Police eventually identified the lettering on the bag to have stood for Central Park New York. They explored the possibility that Wembley Point Woman may have been a tourist from America, but this line of questioning never produced any solid leads. Investigators now believe it's more likely she was from the local area, and even more specifically from the Tottenham (North London) area close to where she bought her bus pass.

Side note: sources seemed fairly confident that CPNY stood for Central Park New York. I'm not sure if other options have been conclusively ruled out though.

**The Bus Pass**

According to investigators, it is very likely that Wembley Point Woman was from the area where she purchased the bus pass and may have even been a frequent commuter on that particular bus route. We also know that she bought the ticket early in the morning; that factor, along with the fact that she was smartly dressed, may suggest she had a professional office-type job. 

In my opinion, that just makes the case even more puzzling because she seems as if she might have had a routine, and therefore, people to notice if she strayed from her routine. One factor that might go against the ""routine"" theory is that Wembley Point Woman bought a weekly bus pass, which seems  strangely short-term to me if she was a regular commuter.

**The Oil Painting**

This seems to be the most baffling of the things carried by the Wembley Point Woman: an oil painting measuring 2ft x 1ft, that is so unique that I wonder how we have gone seventeen years (!) without someone recognizing it. There is yet no consensus on what the painting represents or who might have painted it. It's very possible that it could be a work of art by Wembley Point Woman herself.

I'm no art expert, but the painting seems influenced by Afro-Caribbean culture, which is why I think it might have held some special meaning for Wembley Point Woman. This is total speculation on my part, but the painting seems to focus on themes around identity. If that's true, it definitely is quite a cruel and ironic situation that the owner of the piece remains unidentified to this day.

**Current Investigation**

In partnership with law enforcement, this case is now being examined by Locate International, a community interest company of investigators, specialists, and volunteers. With advancements in technology, especially with the reach of social media, there is renewed hope that soon Wembley Point Woman will be identified and remembered by her proper name as she should be.

79,woolfonmynoggin,1642371542,"Shelby Wright was born in 1990 and was 14 in 2004. He lived with his mother, Lisa Wright, and her parents, Dennis and Yvonne Wright, in Snohomish, Washington; his father was not in his life. He was very good with electronics and was known to buy old computers to dissect for parts. He was able to rig cameras and computers together from parts by the time he was 10. He had a lot of interests, including cats and rare diseases like Mad Cow Disease (krefeld jacobs disease in humans). He seemed to be an animal lover and loved to write, even making his own newsletter for family and friends. 

In the summer of 2004, Shelby spent most of the summer at his uncle's house, helping to care for his great grandmother who was suffering from dementia and going to summer school. He found caring for his great grandmother too much and came home to his mother at the end of July. His grandparents that also lived in the house were out of town. Shelby seemed pretty independent, allowed to roam and get himself to summer school and friends' houses on his scooter. 

On July 26th, 2004, the girlfriend of Rob Wolf rode on her bike to the family home because she was worried about Shelby's whereabouts. Rob Wolf was a very close family friend that was fatherly toward Shelby. He is also described as a ""drug user"" by police and took Shelby to sweep parking lots. This visit sparked an anxious search that went from Snohomish to Machias and uncovered Shelby's scooter on Wolf's property. The last time anyone had contact with Shelby was July 27th when a police officer gave him a ride home and his mother later saw him on his scooter. There is some discrepancy between whether it was the 26th or the 27th the last time someone saw him between the newer news articles and the older ones. The only thing missing was his laptop after his scooter was found at Rob Wolf's house. 

At first, his disappearance was treated like a runaway case but there was no sign of Shelby for years and police began to lean more towards foul play. Searches were conducted on the properties of Shelby's uncle who he had been staying with and Rob Wolf. Nothing turned up. After Wolf's death, further searches were conducted of his former property, this time more thorough as the property was now less cluttered, and still there was no sign of Shelby. This leads us to today; it seems like nothing much has happened in the years since the searches were conducted. Yvonne Wright still looks out her window hoping to see Shelby walking up the driveway but she knows that it isn't likely. His family have all come to believe that he is deceased and was a victim of foul play but questions obviously still remain. What happened to Shelby? 

Police have hinted that they believe Rob Wolf had something to do with Shelby's disappearance but he  and his girlfriend died not that many years after the disappearance and there simply isn't a lot to go on. Their property was littered with rusted out cars when the first search was conducted but they were gone before the second. Was there any evidence in these cars that was lost? Why did Rob's girlfriend ride her bike along a highway to look for Shelby? Shelby's uncle is also a possibility but it is unclear if that was a real suspicion or more perfunctory clearing all men in the boy's life. A stranger or a grooming abduction is also possible but much more unlikely, though without the laptop to search it is impossible to rule out an internet grooming situation. Was there an accident or death by misadventure? Did he actually run away? Again, these are both unlikely but not impossible. Unfortunately, unless someone comes forward or the remains are found, we won't know what happened to Shelby. I believe his mother and grandparents are all still alive as I was unable to find any obits for them. If you have any information on the disappearance of Shelby Wright, call the sheriff’s tip line at 425-388-3845 or Crime Stoppers of Puget Sound at 800-222-8477.

CAMBRIA COUNTY, Pa. (WTAJ) – On the afternoon of Jan. 6, 1996 Forest Hills Ambulance was dispatched to a home in Summerhill, Cambria County where a woman was found dead in her bedroom.

Beth Ann Bodenschatz was discovered with a gunshot wound to her head. 25 years later, her son who was five at the time remains the only witness to the crime.

At the time of the murder, Bodenschatz’s son recalled hearing his mother yelling and seeing a man with a gun shoot her. The shooter was described as having brown hair and wore a brown jacket.

Several other witnesses observed a brown/beige Subaru car parked at the end of Bodenschatz’s driveway where a male had been seen walking from the residence to the vehicle.

The murder weapon has never been found and Ebensburg State Police continue their investigation of the homicide.

I have thought about this case for the last 25 years. I was a junior in high school when this happened. It was a few towns over from where I lived, however in Central Pennsylvania the small towns are very close knit. 


It was heartbreaking when the billboard was put up (in the links), just to think that an innocent 5 year old saw his mother gunned down is almost too much to wrap your head around. 


There were rumors back in the day that it was a murder for hire, but the hit man got the wrong house as it was supposedly intended for a neighbors wife. Again, with small town PA also comes big time rumors. I have no idea if there is any truth to that theory. 


What I do know is that the PA State Police are no closer to solving this cold case then they were in 1996.


I moved out of PA a long time ago, but I never forgot this case. I would absolutely love for a podcast to be made about it to bring it back into the light. Someone knows what happened and someone got away with a horrific murder that day. Let's get the word out.

83,daniel-rago,1642334498,"On January 22, 1993, two seventeen-year-old girls came to Zakopane: Ernestyna Wieruszewska, born on May 14, 1975, permanently residing in Legionowo near Warsaw, and Anna Semczuk, born on February 4, 1975, from the capital district of Praga-Północ. 

The girls were not friends from elementary school, they started to be friends only in September 1992, and they considered the winter break a great opportunity to strengthen their friendship. They both loved hiking in the mountains, so there could be only one goal of their escapade. From January 22, the girls stayed in a private room in Kościelisko, a town adjacent to Zakopane, Poland.

The room was chosen by Wieruszewska, who had already lived there on one of the oasis trips and was clearly satisfied with the hospitality she received there. Over the weekend, the teens hiked in the mountains. The pace of the trips must have been quite strenuous, because in a postcard that Anna sent to her family home, she wrote: ""I'm staggering, but God is my witness, this is what I dreamed about."" According to the findings of the subsequent investigation, the girls visited, among others, Gubałówka, Mroźna Cave, Czarny Staw, Kościeliska Valley, Ornak and Jaworzynka. This is due to the testimony of witnesses, including the landlady of the accommodation, which is also confirmed by entries in the diary kept by Anna.

On Tuesday, January 26, 1993, the two girls woke up around 9 am. They paid the owner of the accommodation for the stay so far, told her that they had made an appointment with their friends at the Zakopane train station, and that they also intended to buy a return ticket to the capital. The woman advised them not to go hiking in the mountains, the day was extremely frosty and snowy.

When the clocks showed 7pm, the landlady began to worry about the prolonged absence of the Warsaw students. 

It was a new day, Wednesday, January 27, 1993. The landlady was surprised and anxious to say that the girls had not returned to their accommodation for the night. She decided to notify the District Police Headquarters in Zakopane and the parents of both seventeen-year-old girls. On Thursday, January 28, 1993, the parents of the missing girls appeared in Kościelisko, who officially reported the missing girls to the Police and TOPR. As it was found unofficially, when the girls' parents appeared in their room, it was cold, as if the heating had been turned off many hours ago.

The first activity carried out by the officers of the Zakopane KRP was the inspection of the rented accommodation. It turned out that the teenager's documents were left on the spot, including passports, warm clothes, a camera, money... 

The Zakopane Police have adopted several hypothetical versions of the events: In the first one it was suspected that, despite the warnings of the hostess, the girls went on a trip to the mountains, during which they had an accident. This version was also considered probable by the hostess and her son, pointing out that in the previous days the girls wandered in the mountains despite clearly unfavorable conditions. The police considered this version unlikely, because all the warm clothes were left in the room, and thus the girls were dressed too lightly for such an expedition. Moreover, the period of time between the girls waking up and the possible departure from the room is only about 20 minutes, which justifies the assumption that they would not have had time to prepare sandwiches or even tea necessary for such an escapade. 

Another version that was considered was homicide. It was supposed that the landlady's son, who was supposed to have had a conflict with Ernestyna during her previous stay and allegedly threatened her, could have done it. This hypothesis was reinforced by the fact that hardly anyone had been established who would confirm with certainty the meeting with the girls after they left their room. The entire property was searched, but no trace of this version of events was found. However, it should be assumed that if the landlady's son had actually made any threats against the girl, she would rather not have chosen this place as her room. 

Another hypothesis emerged, namely that both girls could have been kidnapped to work in an escort agency in Western Europe. Apparently, in the winter of 1993, the Slovak police broke up a gang engaged in this type of activity. Police reached two witnesses. The first of them was supposed to see two young girls getting into a car with foreign registration numbers at the PKS bus stop in Kościelisko on January 26. It can be assumed with a certain degree of probability that they were Ernestyna and Anna. Another witness claimed that at the beginning of March 1993 he witnessed a conversation between two men, during which one of them told about the kidnapping of two young girls in Zakopane. Finally, another argument in favor of this hypothesis is that on March 4, 1993 there was a break-in in Anna's stepfather's car. There would be nothing special about it, if not for the fact that nothing of value was stolen from the car except... a passport and a high school girl's diary. 

Intensive operational activities were carried out, but they did not bring any results. The family asked for help from clairvoyants. Their ""visions"", however, were very contradictory. One of the clairvoyants stated that both girls were dead - one of them due to a skull injury, the other died of fear. Another clairvoyant claimed that high school students went on the trail with the boys they were supposed to meet at the Zakopane train station and were thrown into the abyss during the trip. Another claimed that both girls were alive: Ernestyna is still a resident of Zakopane, and Anna lives north of Warsaw. 

At the beginning of November 1994, the prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office in Zakopane appeared in Warsaw, who received notifications of suspected crime from the parents of high school students. By the decision of November 18, 1994, an investigation was initiated into the deprivation of liberty of both teenagers.

The collected evidence was analyzed, requests for help were sent to Interpol, and witnesses were interrogated. The version of the mishap has been ruled out as unlikely on the grounds that it seems impossible to have a simultaneous accident of two healthy people without leaving any trace. The kidnapping of high school girls and taking them abroad was considered the most likely version. On October 28, 1996, the investigation was suspended due to the lack of premises for its continuation.  The presumption of the disappearance of Ernestyna and Anna will be statute-barred on January 26, 2023.

89,wyldcynic,1642266264,"I’ve become consumed with the Ellen Greenberg case and I’m wondering what theories others may have about her death? I feel there’s really strong evidence against her fiancé. I don’t suspect anyone else and suicide seems ridiculous to me. I’m not sure if it was premeditated but I’m leaning towards no. There are an abundance of red flags in my opinion…here are a few that particularly bother me. 

1- The fiancé’s 911 call. I don’t buy it. Yeah everyone reacts differently and you can’t judge someone in the moment, I get that. BUT. How did he not see a knife protruding from her chest through her clothing? I can’t imagine that would not be clearly evident from the moment he saw her body even from across the room. However, he didn’t notice the knife until he was asked to do CPR, until after he was asked to look directly at her chest to see if she was breathing? And then his first reaction is “Oh, she stabbed herself!” and not something more like “OMG she’s been stabbed?” He’s already putting the suggestion out there that she stabbed herself. That’s the very first assumption he has?

2- The fiancé’s texts to her while he’s locked out. They are increasing ANGRY and even threatening by the end (“you better have an excuse” and “u have no idea”). This really underscores, in addition to multiple bruises at various stages of healing that were found on her body, a potentially abusive personality. If all was fine and well when he left, why would he be so pissed off as opposed to concerned for her welfare? Then of course there’s the obvious question of why he didn’t try to call her rather than just sending texts that she may not hear. And why he took 20 minutes to stand there and text while fuming before going to apartment security for assistance. 

3- Why did he lie and say the security guy was with him when he busted down the door? Unless he wanted a witness upon finding her to lessen the suspicion towards him as the perp. The security guy claims he never accompanied him, never went into the apt, never went up to the 6th floor. No reason for lies unless you are hiding something. 

I’m pretty convinced her fiancé did it but I wonder what theories folks may have about the way it played out?

I believe Ellen’s recently increasing anxiety was the result of her questioning whether the marriage was a good idea, perhaps because the closer they got to the wedding, the more comfortable he became with showing abusive tendencies. Hence the bruises on her body, and her vagueness about the reasons for her mental health issues that she was seeking help for. Domestic abuse victims are often ashamed and don’t even tell their family. Perhaps she wasn’t sure she was “really” being abused and was embarrassed to admit it during the wedding planning. Perhaps she was gaslit and full of self doubt and a little scared. Yet the save the date cards were dropped in the mail, increasing the pressure and making it harder to back out. She spoke to her family about wanting to move home for a while. That’s unusual for a happy couple planning a wedding in just a few months. I think she was scared and knew she needed to get away from him to be safe but was too embarrassed to reveal she had been abused. 

I suspect they got into an argument that afternoon and she - or he - may have threatened to call off the wedding. But at that point my theory sort of splits. Either he was enraged and killed her, catching her off guard while she was making her fruit salad  with such a blitz attack she would not have had defensive wounds, then came up with the idea to rig the lock so it was easy to break down later, and jimmied the lock closed from outside on his way to the gym. At the gym he cleaned up and composed himself, then went back up to find he was “locked out.” In a panic, the only way he could think to make it look like he didn’t do it was to lock her inside where it would be “impossible” for anyone but her to have inflicted the wounds.

Alternately, they argued and he left. Either she told him to leave (angering him) or he stormed out on his own. She locked him out, possibly scared of him or what he may do. He shows back up and sends the increasingly angry texts as she ignores him, which infuriates him to the point of breaking down the door OR she eventually lets him in and goes back to making her salad at which point he’s so furious he attacks her from behind. Then rigs the lock, goes down to the gym, etc from that point. 

Sorry for the length but interested to hear others thoughts on how things played out. Thanks!

90,SteampunkJester,1642263865,"I'm looking for very particular types of unsolved crimes/mysteries where an individual or group:

- Commits a crime whose main purpose isn't murder (or, if a murder does take place, it isn't/perceivably isn't the main motivation for the crime being perpetrated)

- Gets away with said crime and disappears with either very little or no trace as to what happened to them.

- The individual, or if a group, the members' identity isn't known (or at least not concretely proven)

- The individual's or group's actions either don't have a body count or the body count as a result of their actions is very low (single digits)

I don't think I'm going to get a lot of mysteries because this is a very specific type of mystery I'm looking for, but I figured I might as well ask since I'm very interested in these types of unsolved crimes/mysteries where the crime is either outlandish or normal, but yet doesn't focus on murder and the person/people still get away with it completely or relatively unscathed.

92,prajitoruldinoz,1642253431,"On Feb. 27, 1993, Twin Peaks Sheriff’s Station deputies responded to a call for service at a residence for a shot man. 

The 35-year-old man was immediately rushed to San Bernardino Medical Center, but unfortunately was pronounced dead from the gunshot wound. 

According to an article published in 1993 by San Bernardino County Sun, that call was made by an unidentified woman who had called authorities to report she had shot her boyfriend after a dispute.

The man was later identified as 35-year-old Rick Hafty. He was a native of Alhambra and worked as a driver for S.E. Pipeline Construction out of Santa Fe Springs. Hafty was Dad to two daughters. 

Deputies have later arrested Diane Elizabeth Cook, then 41, for investigation of murder, according to the same article from the Sun, but for some reason, Cook was released soon after. Authorities have never disclosed details of the original investigation, so that reason is unknown.

Long story short, with all leads exhausted there was nothing more to be done, so the case went cold.

Fast forward to June 2021: investigators from the Sheriff’s Cold Case Homicide Team have re-examined the case and reopened the investigation. This effort lead to the arrest of the same person arrested 28 years earlier - Diane Elizabeth Cook, who is now 70-year-old.

Authorities have not mentioned what new evidence led to Cook's latest arrest.  

Diane Elizabeth Cook, a resident of Crestline, remains in custody at West Valley Detention Centre in Rancho Cucamonga, with bail set at $1 million.

96,Rustamchik228,1642246667,"During the years of the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995), 45 journalists were killed on the territory of Yugoslavia. The first victims of the armed conflict were employees of the USSR State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinnoy. 30 years ago, on September 1, 1991, their car was shot down near the village of Hrvatska Kostajnica on the Belgrade-Zagreb highway. Their bodies were never found, but in March 2017, despite their status as missing, President of Russia Vladimir Putin awarded them the Order of Courage posthumously. It was only in 2021 that the case got off the ground, but there are still more questions than answers.

On a formal level, the war on the territory of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia began only in the summer of 1991, after on June 25, following Slovenia, it declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). But the first conflicts between the Croatian authorities and local Serbs, of whom more than 600 thousand lived there, began in the summer of 1990. The language was the source of contention.

The fact is that the Croatian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which won the first multi-party elections in May 1990, led by Franjo Tudjman, immediately renamed the Serbo-Croatian language into Croatian, changed its grammar, and banned the use of Cyrillic on the territory of the republic. Any mention of events from the history of Serbia, as well as Serbian writers and poets, were excluded from the school curriculum.

In addition, public discrimination against Serbs began in Croatia. Thus, one of the leaders of the CDU, later President of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, said that the local Serbs own as much land as they can carry on the soles of their shoes. And Franjo Tudjman called the Independent State of Croatia created by Hitler, where more than a million Serbs were killed by local Ustashe fascists in 1941-1945, the result of *""thousand-year aspirations of the Croatian people.""*

Discrimination was also formal: all Serbs working in the power structures, primarily militsiyamen, were forced to sign a humiliating “letter of loyalty” (nothing like this was required from Croats and representatives of other nationalities). As a result, in May 1990, parallel power structures began to form in Serb-populated areas of Croatia. In early July 1990, the militsiya of the city of Knin, led by Milan Martic, refused to obey the Ministry of the Interior of Croatia, after which militsiya units in other areas where the majority were Serbs began to announce the same thing.

On August 17, 1990, special forces moved out of Zagreb into the recalcitrant areas. The military was ordered to remove all weapons from the rebellious militsiya stations. This was done only in the town of Benkovac. The response of the Serbs was the ""Log Revolution"" - the widespread construction of barricades on the territory of Serbian communities. Because of this, communication between the northern and southern parts of Croatia was effectively terminated. Later, this day in the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina was celebrated as a public holiday - the Day of the Uprising of the Serbian people.

In March 1991, the first armed clashes began between Serbian self-defense units and units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard, and the Armed Forces of Croatia. According to the laws of the SFRY, all of the above structures were illegal armed formations. Weapons and ammunition came to Croatia from abroad, mainly from Hungary. At the same time, the Yugoslav People's Army did not intervene in these clashes for a long time, only creating separate zones of demarcation between the conflicting parties in the hottest spots.

Even after the declaration of independence of Croatia, parts of the Yugoslav People's Army were in no hurry to oppose the separatist armed units, most likely due to the indecision of Belgrade and the lost ten-day war in Slovenia in July 1991. This made it possible for the Croatian troops to consolidate their forces and establish general control, which was also helped by foreign military forces. Already on September 19, there was a massive attack by Croatian armed units on the Yugoslav People's Army barracks, which were completely captured within a month. But as of September 1, 1991, clashes in Croatia were still local.

At the time of the business trip to Yugoslavia, the USSR State Radio and Television correspondent Viktor Nogin already had experience in the combat zone in Afghanistan. However, the Balkans were his love, because in 1972 Nogin graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of the University of Zagreb. But the flourishing and peaceful Yugoslavia, which he remembered from his youth, no longer existed.

Throughout August 1991, Viktor and his cameraman Gennady Kurinnoy traveled to the battlefields in Croatia almost every day, filmed, returned to Belgrade, and transported materials to Moscow. In the evening they watched the story on the *Vremya* program, after which they talked with colleagues until midnight. Yugoslav television often invited Viktor as a guest on their air to show exclusive footage of the fights.

On the morning of September 1, 1991, having filmed a celebratory assembly at the school at the USSR Embassy in Belgrade, Nogin and Kurinnoy left in the direction of Zagreb. They were going to shoot a material about the Serbo-Croatian armed conflict, to then overtake it to Moscow from the capital of Croatia. The journalists left in a dark blue Opel Omega car, which traveled many fronts of the Yugoslav war. Huge white letters TV were stuck on its hood and doors - such ones can be seen from afar. The license plates on the car were diplomatic - 10-A-155. But the journalists never made it to Zagreb.

Their relatives and colleagues, who then worked in the Balkans, got used to the frequent trips of Nogin and Kurinnoy, so at first, they were not worried. Only three days after his departure, when Nogin did not go on the air from Zagreb at the appointed time and did not call anyone, close correspondents sounded the alarm. After that, the search began.

Initially, the missing journalists were searched for by their colleagues who worked in the Balkans. Sergei Gryzunov, former chairman of the Russian press and mass communications committee, who headed the bureau of the Novosti Press Agency in Belgrade in 1991 and, together with colleagues, conducted a journalistic investigation into the incident, said: *“In the Serbian internment camp on the mountain of Manyacha, we found Croatian policemen, who were the last, except for the killers, who saw our guys alive.”*

According to him, the policemen confirmed that Russian journalists arrived in the morning of September 1 in Kostajnica, which was occupied by Croatian units, filmed there and headed towards Petrini, despite the warning that it was dangerous to go to Zagreb. One of the policemen said that ""the car was driven by the bigger one.""  Gryzunov explained: *“So this was Viktor, he was a head taller than his operator and 25 kilograms heavier.”*

*""We discovered the place of the tragedy on September 11th. A couple of kilometers from Kostajnitsa, a dark oil stain and traces of a burned-out car remained on the pavement. Also, we found the remains of the dark blue Opel: a gas tank cap, burnt tires, and moldings. There were furrows on the pavement - the car was pulled off the road.""*

At the same time, colleagues of the missing journalists were faced with the fact that the Serbian authorities were not eager to cooperate with the investigation. Their representatives hinted that ""it is not worth digging deep, because this could damage Serbian-Russian relations."" And witnesses who saw the missing journalists or knew something about what happened, in the presence of the Serbian police, as a rule, began to deny everything. In off-the-record conversations, residents of villages in the Kostajnica area already in September 1991 confidently asserted: *“Russian journalists were killed by the Serbian military.”* By a strange coincidence, many eyewitnesses who expressed a willingness to speak disappeared.

In the fall of 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Yugoslav side with a request to search for journalists. However, two months later, the Soviet Union and hope for government assistance in the investigation collapsed. After Gorbachev's appeal, the military prosecutor's office of Yugoslavia nevertheless opened a criminal case, and in April 1992 a burned car was even found, but there were no remains of journalists in it.

In the end, the prosecutors issued a ruling that the Yugoslav military was not involved in the disappearance of journalists, and transferred the case to the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. For more than a year, it lay motionless, until a Russian journalist, Nogin’s friend in Afghanistan Vladimir Mukusev, who was then a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, intervened again in the situation.

Mukusev said: *""In March 1993, I proposed the creation of a special parliamentary commission of inquiry. The Supreme Council voted unanimously in favor. At the suggestion of Khasbulatov, I was appointed chairman.”* Soon, in response to requests, Mukusev received a mountain of documents from various departments. It turned out that several structures were interested in the search for journalists: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Embassy, ​​which even appointed a premium of five thousand marks for any information. The Foreign Intelligence Service under the leadership of Yevgeny Primakov and the office of Vice President Alexander Rutskoy were also involved in the case.

At the same time, according to Mukusev, Primakov did not just respond to the request. *“We began to meet regularly, but not at his headquarters in Yasenevo, but at various secret addresses. He kept asking how things were going. But suddenly, at the end of the summer, he called himself and asked to come along with Galina Nogina. Primakov said that in 1991, most likely, a tragedy occurred. And then he asked me to talk in private. The head of intelligence showed the documents, from which I realized that not just a witness appeared, but an accomplice to the murder.”*

This witness was part of a group of 13 militsiyamen who were following orders from Milan Martić, then Minister of the Interior and later President of Serbian Krajina. The order was to get the source files of the videos that were filmed by journalists who worked on both front lines. 12 of those policemen, including the commander, then died under various circumstances.

Only one remained alive, and only because shortly after those events he was convicted of hooliganism, and when he came out a year and a half later, he learned from his wife that a prize had been appointed for information about the missing journalists. They hoped to get money and go to Germany. The wife of the former OMON agent went to the Russian embassy in Belgrade and told everything. According to her, her husband was ready to testify on record. Russian television journalists went to meet him.

As follows from the eyewitness account, the policemen were instructed to obtain information from journalists who worked on the Croatian side at any cost. The soldiers were told that they were Croatian spies. A special forces detachment took control of the road, along which a car with a conspicuous TV identification mark was supposed to go.

As the witness said: *""When the car appeared, they fired at the wheels, but the bullets passed at the level of the doors. Nogin was injured. Journalists were finished off with shots in the head, then they doused the car with gasoline and set it on fire.""*

They ordered a tractor driver from a nearby village to drag the remains several kilometers away, throw them into the river and crush the roof sticking out of the water with a bucket. After the beginning of the investigation, he again dragged the car to the side and buried the remains of journalists.

Mukusev said: *“We went to the witness with Primakov's employees. We traveled by train and found out in Belgrade that he had been killed the day before. All I had left was a diagram drawn by him, without reference to a place, and a video recording of his testimony. With this, we ended up in Serbian Krajina. For several days they tried in vain to get through to someone. But they didn't really want to talk to us. Suddenly, they told me that Martić wanted to see me alone in Banja Luka (now the capital of the Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina). He said that he was giving us a day to get out, otherwise, they would look for us even longer than those journalists.”*

In 2002, Milan Martić was handed over to the Hague Tribunal on charges of organizing ethnic cleansing. In court, in particular, he testified that he personally ordered to obtain materials from Russian journalists.

After a conversation with Martić, Mukusev went to the town of Glina (which was part of the Serbian Krajina, now the territory of Croatia), where the headquarters of the Yugoslav army and the Serbian military prosecutor's office were once located. *“When I appeared there in the investigator’s office and asked if they had any traces left, literally a minute later they brought me a search file. The investigator immediately wrote a decision to initiate a criminal case on the fact of the disappearance of journalists and a paper on the need to provide me with all kinds of assistance.”*

With documents, he again went to the area where the journalists were killed. On September 19, 1993, the local police began excavations based on the scheme that Mukusev had, but a day later the well-known decree of Russian President Boris Yeltsin No. 1400 was issued on the dissolution of the Supreme Council. *“Just now I was a deputy and suddenly turned out to be a completely private person, a foreigner. I was immediately given to understand that the search was ending. In Moscow, several high-ranking officials whom I addressed upon my return directly said: “We don’t need new problems in the Balkans. Forget it. Now, if only the Croats did it…”*

In 1995, after Operation Storm, Serbian Krajina became a territory of Croatia. And a couple of years later, a message was received from Zagreb that the Croatian army had seized documents about the interrogation by the military prosecutor's office of the Yugoslav People's Army of the captain and ensign of the army of Serbian Krajina, eyewitnesses of the attack on Nogin and Kurinnoy. These statements were forwarded to the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

However, requests from the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia for the transfer of materials about these two witnesses remained without a concrete answer. Federal Yugoslav authorities made it clear to Russian prosecutors that ""their investigation is undesirable"" and ""the past is dead."" At the beginning of 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ceased to exist, turning into the Community of Serbia and Montenegro, which, three years later, peacefully dispersed, becoming independent states. There has been a long lull in the case of the murder of Russian journalists.

In 2010, Mukusev approached Croatian President Ivo Josipović with a proposal to install a memorial sign at the site of the death of Russians, create a joint Russian-Croatian commission to finally find the remains and bury them, and also establish a personal scholarship at the University of Zagreb, which graduated from Viktor Nogin. So far, only one wish has been fulfilled: in May 2011, a memorial plaque was installed at the place of death of journalists. The ceremony was attended by Mukusev and the son of Gennady Kurinny.

The commemorative inscription on the tablet is in two languages, but their texts are radically different, and this is not a matter of subtleties or translation errors.

The inscription in Russian reads: *“On this spot on September 1, 1991, Russian journalists of the USSR State Radio and Television Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinnoy tragically died in the performance of their professional duty. Never forget""*. Caption in Croatian: *""Here on September 1, 1991, in the first months of the Patriotic War, members of the Serbian paramilitary units villainously killed Russian journalists Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurinny.""*

On March 20, 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded journalists the Order of Courage ""for courage and dedication shown in the performance of official and civic duty"" posthumously. Despite the wording “posthumously,” the journalists are listed as missing because their remains have not yet been found.

However, the chances of finding the burial place of the journalists still remain. In February 2021, the Croatian Ministry of the Interior opened a criminal case against the perpetrators of the murder of Nogin and Kurinny. Without disclosing names, the prosecution announced that it had decided to investigate a citizen of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, born in 1957, as well as a citizen of BaH, born in 1965, on suspicion of committing a crime against humanity and international law.

According to the investigation, the attackers were 26 and 33 years old at the time of the crime, they were members of a Serbian paramilitary group. At the moment they are outside of Croatia.

Local media immediately reported that the suspects were named Ilija Cizmich and Zdravko Matiyasevic-Zabac and they lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Croatian Interior Ministry noted that the investigation was conducted with the international assistance of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Russia.

According to Croatian law enforcement officers, on September 1, 1991, Nogin and Kurinnoy entered the village of Hrvatska Kostajnica, which at that time was under the control of Croatian units. There, journalists recorded interviews with residents, members of the Croatian militia, and the police. The interlocutors warned them that the road from Kostajnica to Petrinja was not safe, but Nogin replied: *""Don't worry, I have experience in the Afghan war, you Croats are good people, and the Serbs are our brothers.""*

However, when a car with diplomatic plates drove up from Kostajnica, a group of criminals opened fire on the car with small arms. The wounded Viktor Nogin shouted *""Don't shoot, we are your brothers,""* but that didn't help.

When the car stopped, the shooters approached, and the 26-year-old suspect demanded that the wounded show their documents: passports and press cards. He then killed the journalists by shooting them in the head with a pistol. Most of the members of the unit, including its commander, the second suspect, became witnesses.

The Interior Ministry said in the statement: *“Although the 33-year-old suspect, as a commander, was obliged to prevent the shooter, he did nothing and, together with members of the group, took several actions to conceal the circumstances of the crime.”* Later, the journalists' car was looted and burned along with the corpses. The charred remains were hidden in the territory, which was then controlled by the Serbs. Most of the described facts have been known since 1992. The only news is that the perpetrators have been identified and are still alive.

Information about whether Croatia applied to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a request for the extradition of the suspects in the murder of Nogin and Kurinnoy is not publicly available. Thus, in this case, instead of a dot, there is still an ellipsis...

The Javanese court poet Raden Ngabahi Ranggawarsita spent decades researching and writing a sprawling history of Java entitled the *Book of Kings*, the first edition of which was published in 1869. Side note: this book is thousands of pages long and it was said that Ranggawarsita wrote three pages of it per day for thirty years. A reference to the eruption appears in the early part of his history called ""The Book of Ancient Kings"" and reads as follows:

&gt; The whole world was greatly shaken, and violent thundering, accompanied by heavy rain and storms took place, but not only did not this heavy rain extinguish the eruption of the fire of the mountain Kapi, but augmented the fire; the noise was fearful, at last the mountain Kapi with a tremendous roar burst into pieces and sank into the deepest of the earth. The water of the sea rose and inundated the land, the country to the east of the mountain Batuwara, to the mountain Raja Basa, was inundated by the sea; the inhabitants of the northern part of the Sunda country to the mountain Raja Basa, were drowned and swept away with all their property.

A second edition of *Book of Kings* was published in 1885 and provides a much more detailed account of the eruption, as well as including the year of the event this time, which you can see in the following short excerpt:

&gt; In the year Saka* 338 (AD 416) a thundering noise was heard from the mountain Batuwara, which was answered by a similar noise coming from the mountain Kapi, lying westward of the modern Bantam. A great glaring fire which reached the sky came out of the last-named mountain. The whole world was greatly shaken and violent thundering accompanied by heavy rains and storms took place.

It is unknown to which mountain ""Kapi"" is referring, since that name is no longer used, but due to certain geographical clues in the text, it is thought that ""Kapi"" is actually Krakatoa. 

It is believed that Ranggawarsita likely referenced primary source material in the writing of his book, but there is a question as to which sources he used, since we know very little about his bibliography. However, it can be surmised that he most likely referenced ancient Javanese manuscripts that had been written on palm leaves, and of which the Kraton library in Solo (in Java) possessed many. Ten thousand of these palm leaf texts, written in a variety of manuscript styles, survive today. Though relatively few of them actually relate to the ancient history of Java.

Ranggawarsita's book also mentions a man named Jayabaya, the monarch who supposedly oversaw the documenting of the accounts of this volcanic eruption. According to this story, Jayabaya was visited by a Hindu god named Naraddha, who informed him of this eruption and encouraged him to make a record of it. Naraddha told Jayabaya that this event took place in the 338th year of the Shaka Calendar (AD 416). Jayabaya was a real Javanese king in the 12th century. So, was this myth built around a real event? 

Beyond the aforementioned sources, there is no further evidence that this eruption actually happened. 

**Did he get the date wrong?**

There is both ice core and tree ring evidence for a massive eruption having occurred in either Java or Sumatra around AD 535. Possibly an eruption of Krakatoa? Going back to the *Book of Kings*, Ranggawarsita included entries relating to a large portion of the days covered by the book. However, there are notably far fewer entries for the eighteen years following the eruption of AD 535, suggesting that something happened that was a big enough deal to disrupt the palm leaf writings of the scribes for nearly two decades. 

It's also important to note the years following AD 416 hint at no such disruption in the writing of the palm leaf histories.

**Conclusion**

Were these two supposed early eruptions of Krakatoa actually just one eruption?

*The Shaka Calendar was the Hindu dating system used exclusively on these islands and which began in the year AD 78.

Anyway, it seems many people speculate poor mental health, from manic episodes to suicide ideation, to be a major factor in some unresolved disappearances / deaths.  
Sometimes, a victim’s mental distress is evident like with the all famous Elisa Lam case, but what are other cases yall know of where extreme mental distress was speculated but overlooked? 

The case that makes me ask this question is pasted here:

I’m interested in this topic because I know many people who are actually ashamed of their mental health issues and only talk about it in the form of (cynical) “jokes” or when they’re blackout drunk.  
Not that I’m worried they’ll just disappear or something, I’m just interested in how our culture’s perceptions of mental health may impact breaks in unsolved mysteries.   Do investigators consider it a factor even if the victim’s despair or plan to leave isn’t incredibly
 evident?

On the other hand, another consideration of the subject is the internet’s normalization of expressing mental distress- I’d like to learn about more cases where investigators took to a victim’s social media to pick up any clues.

A massive search took place of both the mill and other areas where he may have been to, but Jim has never been found. His car was initially thought to be gone from site but was eventually located parked far from his usual car park.

5 days later, his hard hat was found next to an industrial acid bath on the mill site, and when drained his palm pilot, identification card and his work key was in the acid bath. No human remains were found, and his home and car keys have never been located.

They arrived in the city on Dec 30th, in the late afternoon hours. Shortly after they unpacked, they contacted their families just to check in with them. Then, they went into a restaurant to have a dinner, and shortly after decided to go into a famous club named ""Gotik"" at around 10pm. 

They were partying and having fun for a few hours, when suddenly, at around 1:30am, his friends noticed that Matej was missing. They didn't sweat it at first, because they thought he just got lost in the crowd and would eventually show up, being that they also noticed his jacket was still in the club's wardrobe. After a night out, they returned to their apartment, still thinking that Matej would show up. 

The following morning, he was still nowhere to be found so they contacted police at around 6pm the following day and the investigation began. What they found out was quite... bizarre, to say the least.

In [this video](https://youtu.be/kG8D3b4tCyQ) of the latest press conference from Serbian police, you can see complete footage from the CC cameras around the city. It was found out that he seemingly, out of nowhere, rushed out of the club around 1:43am and kept running aimlessly throughout the city for the next 10 to 15 minutes, behaving very strangely. He runs in the middle of a road and intersection, tries to stop and forcefully get into a taxi, jumps over fences and ultimately vanishes into thin air at the shore of Sava river, near restaurant ""Savanova"", just a few hundred meters south of the club. He was wearing a T-shirt even though it was barely several degrees outside, yet he left his jacket at the club. 

Since this video is in Serbian language, I'll just list here the most important things the officer says:

* the footage showed that there was no one chasing after him, or anyone that he was chasing. He seemed to be on his own for the whole duration of the trip.
* the part where he tries to holler a taxi was the only confirmed time he was having an interaction with someone else since he went missing. Apparently, the taxi driver didn't let him in the car because he already had a reservation for someone else. He didn't seem drunk or drugged to him, but rather like he was in a hurry and just wanted to get somewhere fast.
* the footage at 7 minutes and 30 seconds was the last known confirmed footage of him, after that he was nowhere to be found. He didn't return back to the club, he didn't go any other way, he just climbed down to the shore and disappeared.
* it is known he was drinking alcohol at the club with his friends, but it is unclear whether he was on drugs, with some suspecting he indeed consumed something. It is also unclear whether he had an interaction with someone at the terrace of the restaurant and met foul play, or whether he jumped into the river by accident and drown under the influence of the supstance he was consuming.
* the last known location of his mobile phone matched the location of the object that was seen floating through the river in the last two clips, but it is unclear whether that is a person, or something else. They don't know whether Matej ended up in the river at all. They just know his last known location was at the terrace in front of the restaurant, directly in front of the river.
* all of his friend passed polygraph questioning and they, including many other eyewitnesses, said that they haven't noticed anything unusual at the club that would result in him disappearing. Some of them noticed a conflict between two groups of people, but nothing out of the ordinary, they thought it was typical nightclubbing-alcohol induced behaviour.
* the last known interaction of him before disappearing is a phone call he made shortly before exiting the club. He called his female friend that was also in the city and wanted for to get together with her group of friends in order to party together.

A 70-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of killing a man in Crestline after authorities reopened a 28-year old cold case, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s officials reported.

Diane Elizabeth Cook remained in custody Thursday at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, with bail set at $1 million, sheriff’s booking records show.

The San Bernardino County Superior Court on Tuesday charged Cook with murder, according to court records, which show no scheduled court date.

Cook was arrested at 1:52 p.m. Wednesday in the 24600 block of Bernard Drive in Crestline on suspicion of killing 35-year-old Rick Hafty, sheriff’s officials reported.

On Feb. 27, 1993, Twin Peaks Sheriff’s Station deputies responded to a call for service at a residence for a shot man. The victim was later identified as Hafty, sheriff’s officials said.

Hafty was transported to San Bernardino Medical Center and was pronounced dead from the gunshot wound. Homicide investigators responded to the location and conducted an investigation. At the time, investigators exhausted all leads and the case remained open.

Sheriff’s deputies reported that Hafty was shot in the 23500 block of Lake Drive in Crestline. An unidentified woman had called authorities to report she had shot her boyfriend after a dispute, the San Bernardino County Sun reported in 1993.

Hafty was a native of Alhambra and worked as a driver for S.E. Pipeline Construction out of Santa Fe Springs.

His survivors at the time were his two daughters, his parents and a sister. A memorial service for Hafty was held at Green Acres Chapel Bloomington.

114,ArtemisDax,1642190800,"**How awful is** ***My Immortal*****, anyway?**

The mystery of Tara Gilesbie and Raven.

**What is** ***My Immortal***?

*My Immortal* is a ‘Harry Potter’ fan fiction written by Tara Gilesbie and edited by Raven in 2006 and 2007. It consists of 44 chapters and over 22,000 words. The author of chapters 39 and 40 claimed to be a troll who hacked Tara’s account, and exhibits a significantly different style of writing. The author of chapter 41 claims to be Tara once again in control of her own account, but curiously she left the ‘hacked’ chapter on her account as she posted 41-44. [Fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/) removed *My Immortal* in 2008. Tara Gilesbie and Raven subsequently abandon their Fanfiction.net accounts and despite several debunked claims over the years, there has never been a confirmed contact with either one since.

**Who are Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

While there has been some limited discussion of very early internet sightings of Raven and/or Tara, the saga really starts when Raven first appears first on [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/). Her real name may be Jennie, and she wrote a bad Harry Potter fic called *I'm Not Okay.* No one has ever been successfully connected to any of the ‘real names’ of either of the authors. Most people believe that they are American, despite references to *dubya* (read: Dubai or “W”) and visiting Transylvania. They claim to be goths who shop at Hot Topic, love My Chemical Romance, hate preps and Hillary Duff, and have never read any of the Harry Potter books.

**The Worst Fan Fiction in the World!**

Although there are a handful of other popular contenders, *My Immortal* is generally believed to be one of the worst works to ever grace the internet. The writing is juvenile, the plot is inscrutable, and the characters overdone to the point of being charactures. The spelling and grammar are borderline illegible in places. The author’s notes specifically are written in an over the top early aughts texting lingo that makes your eyes bleed. *I’m Not Okay,* purportedly authored by Raven, features many of the same traits including the absolutely hilarious physical descriptions of characters, but is slightly better executed. This meshes with the fact that the dubious quality of the work takes a nosedive without her editing, a break usually traced to a stolen sweater after chapter 15. The only really legible chapters were written by the hacker.

**A work of trolling genius?**

Many people look at these traits and decide that no one could possibly write such an awful fic seriously. It is so bad, it’s not only good, it was bad on purpose. Additional points frequently mentioned include Harry Potter references not found in the movies, humorously misused SAT words, and references to pop culture that do not seem to fit with either the persona of Tara Gilesbie or Raven, such as Tom Bombadil a character only found in the Lord of the Rings Books. Others think that the fic was started at least somewhat on the level and devolved over time. Some go as far to say that the entire network of Raven and Tara accounts were built over time by a single, unusually dedicated, troll.

**But is it actually all that bad?**

*My Immortal* has been a meme for over a decade, and quotes drawn from the worst passages are constantly being passed around. But I realized I’d never sat down and actually \*read\* any of it. I’m not going to tell you it’s good. It’s not. The tone is incredibly juvenile and little of the plot structure or characters make much sense. But the actual writing isn’t significantly different from many other less than stellar fics I’ve seen. The grammar and punctuation is imperfect, but perfectly reasonable in most places given how frankly bizarre the rules of English are. If the sentence was readable and not too far off from common usage I gave them a pass. I counted the errors in three categories: text/slang(obviously intentional), wrong word, and true mistakes.

**No one ever knows the ending: The First Era of My Immortal**

Chapters 1-10

I think people forget, distracted by the beautiful dumpster fire it became, that there was a time when *My Immortal* wasn’t *My Immortal*. It was just another bad Harry Potter fic. Getting the attention of the internet, good or bad, isn’t easy. Most bad fics get a few negative reviews and slowly fade out of memory. This is what happened to *I’m Not Okay,* Raven’s fic. Despite having many of the hallmarks of its more famous sibling, no one paid much attention. If *My Immortal* was always intended as an extended trolling joke, it would have been a lot of work to set up all the accounts for little hope of a real payoff. In fact, the first three chapters of *My Immortal* has just *one* misused word. It’s stupid and silly, but perfectly readable English. This pattern continues through the first ten chapters. And many of the errors are understandable. Off written as of. Forhead instead of forehead. All of the characters are spelled correctly (including Hogsmeade, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Voldemort) and all in their correct capacity. For a pair of trolls, this is remarkably tame. In fact, there are only a bare handful of things that would even be catchable by spellcheck. My Immortal appears to have been *spellchecked*.

Chapters 11 and 12

And then everything goes insane. The error rate jumps from a little under 1%, most of it obviously intentional or understandable to a whopping 7.2%. Most people think that these chapters were reviewed by Raven before posting. The author’s note from 11 even thanks her: *AN: i sed stup flaming up prepz! c if dis chaptr is srupid!1111 it delz wit rly sris issus! sp c 4 urself if itz ztupid brw fangz 2 ma frend raven 4 hleping me!

This matches with the marked deterioration of these two chapters. This is also where two of the classic features of *My Immortal* are introduced. The texting lingo from the author’s notes has crept into the story itself, and the character names are now all over the board.

Chapters 13-15.

Raven’s back! And the mistakes are being fixed again. But Tara and Raven seem to have learned something. I wish the original comments section had been preserved. But based on what the internet is still fixated on, I’d say they got a lot of attention for both the texting slang and the character names. Those are here to stay. Like most creators, Tara and Raven are learning from feedback what gets them comments.

**So who** ***are*** **Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

I believe it is an underestimated possibility that, at least at the beginning, *My Immortal* is exactly what it appears to be on the surface. An earnest, but bad, first attempt at fic written by two very young authors. I think that most people also overestimate their age. The awkward sex scenes and increased mistakes in these paragraphs indicate to me that Tara and Raven are in early middle school. Claiming not to have read Harry Potter is complete bullshit. But they are exploring other interests and developing the Tara and Raven personas, using a previous interest to do so. They still like Harry Potter, but it's not cool anymore. Goths, vampires, sex, and angsty music are cool. What are goths, vampires, sex, and angsty music? They're not sure yet. I think this explains some of the oddities of their interests and references. They're trying too hard even in the author's notes. Fairly intelligent girls trying to distance themselves from childhood things like fantasy. What's more 12 than writing a Harry Potter fic to prove you're goth and cool?

Ignoring everything that came later, what does the first era of *My Immortal* mean to you?

**Richard Clements** was a 72-year-old double amputee living alone in his apartment on 13F, 1 Coin St in the suburbs of Etobicoke, Toronto. On Dec 3, 2008, his body was found at his apartment. He was lying on the ground over a large pool of blood. Beside him was his overturned wheelchair and a ""non-functional"" cellphone. Richard was pronounced dead at the scene.

A small amount of cash was missing. Some quarters and nickels were found scattered on the staircases of the apartment block, which seems to indicate a low-level robbery. There was no sign of forced entry. Richard's prosthetic limbs were found on his motorized scooter, which had been left in the hallway. A set of bloody footprint (later identified to be Nike Air Edge) led right out of Richard's apartment, went across the hall, down a flight of stairs to 12F and to the apartment directly underneath Richard's. However, the footprints never stepped inside the 12F apartment.

Post-mortem examinations determined Richard died of multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest. Toronto case files currently list his date of death as Dec 2, the day before his body was discovered. There were traces of blood across different floors of the entire apartment building. However, it was found out in 2021 (see below) that the DNA profile of the scattered blood did not match the DNA profile retrieved from the immediate crime scene. There is a possibility of more than one perpetrator.

**The victim**

Richard was described by his friend as someone who ""had a heart bigger than his brain."" Police described him as having a ""blind trust in others."" He often left his door unlocked for his neighbors, possibly explaining the lack of sign of forced entry. He had a habit of lending money to others. Before the amputation, Richard worked as a hairdresser for a short while, before operating his own copy shop. Richard was openly gay, and did a lot of free printing for LGBTQ-owned businesses. According to his friends, Richard operated the shop at a loss. Most of his employees were LGBTQ. He also volunteered at Casey House, the only stand-alone hospital for people with HIV/AIDS in Canada. In the mid-2000s, both his legs were amputated after a botched gallbladder removal surgery. He was forced to move out of his disability-unfriendly home and to 1 Coin St. By the time of his death, he had been living in the apartment for one and a half years. During this time, he ""lived on a modest disability pension and volunteered.""

**The 12F apartment**

The 12F apartment belonged to **Michael Edge**, a fellow double amputee and a close friend of Richard. In fact, the last time Richard was seen alive was by Michael - when Richard was walking Michael's dog on the day of his death. The building’s property manager recounted that, a few days before the murder, Michael visited his office and gave him a peculiar warning. “He came into my office and said that something is happening that he does not like, and he's afraid somebody would get injured.” When the property manager advised Michael to notify the police, Michael responded that he was too scared to make the call.

Detectives now believe that the killer was trying to frame Michael with the footprints. (Because he is also a double amputee, the footprints could not have been his.) Detectives believe that Michael knew who the perpetrator was. Michael never named the perpetrator, though police described him as ""co-operative."" Detectives believe Michael was afraid of meeting the same fate as Richard. After the murder, the property manager noted that Michael started carrying a hammer with him. Michael died a year later, in 2009, of natural causes. His body was thoroughly examined to rule out any foul play.

**The witness who discovered the body**

The body was found by **Raymond Hicks**, a close friend of Richard's. Raymond was a heroin user who apparently would steal from Richard, even ""his mother’s diamond ring, or paintings off his walls."" Raymond would also, according to one eyewitness account, threaten Richard when he refused to give him money. Despite this, Richard still kept Raymond around as a friend. DNA evidence has ruled out Raymond as the killer. Raymond went to visit Richard shortly after midnight (Personal note - though police case files list police respond time at 12:18 p.m. Probably some discrepancy) and found the door open. When Raymond found the body, he attempted to call 911 with the apartment phone, but ""it was not working,"" so he went to Michael's apartment. Michael called 911, relaying what Raymond told him. Raymond died in 2011.

**Investigation progress**

Police theorized the following:

* The perpetrator was acquainted with both Richard and Michael
* Michael knew who the perpetrator was
* The perpetrator was familiar with the apartment building and the surrounding area

In 2009, police offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.

In 2021, DNA from the crime scene was re-examined. A DNA profile, believed to be the killer's, was extracted, though no match was found through the national offender databank. Police were retrieving DNA from people involved with the case.

My questions:

* Why frame a double amputee with footprints if the killer knew Michael?
* Why rob and murder if the picture of the victim as a generous man is true?
* Why escalate a low-level robbery to a murder? It was unlikely that the victim could resist or fight back.

The mystery of Tara Gillesbe and Raven.

**What is** ***My Immortal*****?**

*My Immortal* is a ‘Harry Potter’ fan fiction written by Tara Gilesbie and edited by Raven in 2006 and 2007. It consists of 44 chapters and over 22,000 words. The author of chapters 39 and 40 claimed to be a troll who hacked Tara’s account, and exhibits a significantly different style of writing. The author of chapter 41 claims to be Tara once again in control of her own account, but curiously she left the ‘hacked’ chapter on her account as she posted 41-44. [Fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/) removed *My Immortal* in 2008. Tara Gilesbie and Raven subsequently abandon their Fanfiction.net accounts and despite several debunked claims over the years, there has never been a confirmed contact with either one since.

**Who are Tara Gilesbie and Raven?**

While there has been some limited discussion of very early internet sightings of Raven and/or Tara, the saga really starts when Raven first appears first on [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/). Her real name may be Jennie, and she wrote a bad Harry Potter fic called *I'm Not Okay.* No one has ever been successfully connected to any of the ‘real names’ of either of the authors. Most people believe that they are American, despite references to *dubya* (read: Dubai or “W”) and visiting Transylvania. They claim to be goths who shop at Hot Topic, love My Chemical Romance, hate preps and Hillary Duff, and have never read any of the Harry Potter books.

**The Worst Fan Fiction in the World!**

Although there are a handful of other popular contenders, *My Immortal* is generally believed to be one of the worst works to ever grace the internet. The writing is juvenile, the plot is inscrutable, and the characters overdone to the point of being charactures. The spelling and grammar are borderline illegible in places. The author’s notes specifically are written in an over the top early aughts texting lingo that makes your eyes bleed. *I’m Not Okay,* purportedly authored by Raven, features many of the same traits including the absolutely hilarious physical descriptions of characters, but is slightly better executed. This meshes with the fact that the dubious quality of the work takes a nosedive without her editing, a break usually traced to a stolen sweater after chapter 15. The only really legible chapters were written by the hacker.

**A work of trolling genius?**

Many people look at these traits and decide that no one could possibly write such an awful fic seriously. It is so bad, it’s not only good, it was bad on purpose. Additional points frequently mentioned include Harry Potter references not found in the movies, humorously misused SAT words, and references to pop culture that do not seem to fit with either the persona of Tara Gilesbie or Raven, such as Tom Bombadil a character only found in the Lord of the Rings Books. Others think that the fic was started at least somewhat on the level and devolved over time. Some go as far to say that the entire network of Raven and Tara accounts were built over time by a single, unusually dedicated, troll.

**But is it actually all that bad?**

*My Immortal* has been a meme for over a decade, and quotes drawn from the worst passages are constantly being passed around. But I realized I’d never sat down and actually \*read\* any of it. I’m not going to tell you it’s good. It’s not. The tone is incredibly juvenile and little of the plot structure or characters make much sense. But the actual writing isn’t significantly different from many other less than stellar fics I’ve seen. The grammar and punctuation is imperfect, but perfectly reasonable in most places given how frankly bizarre the rules of English are. If the sentence was readable and not too far off from common usage I gave them a pass. I counted the errors in three categories: text/slang(obviously intentional), wrong word, and true mistakes. 

**No one ever knows the ending: The First Era of My Immortal**

Chapters 1-10

I think people forget, distracted by the beautiful dumpster fire it became, that there was a time when *My Immortal* wasn’t *My Immortal*. It was just another bad Harry Potter fic. Getting the attention of the internet, good or bad, isn’t easy. Most bad fics get a few negative reviews and slowly fade out of memory. This is what happened to *I’m Not Okay,* Raven’s fic. Despite having many of the hallmarks of its more famous sibling, no one paid much attention. If *My Immortal* was always intended as an extended trolling joke, it would have been a lot of work to set up all the accounts for little hope of a real payoff. In fact, the first three chapters of *My Immortal* has just *one* misused word. It’s stupid and silly, but perfectly readable English. This pattern continues through the first ten chapters. And many of the errors are understandable. Off written as of. Forhead instead of forehead. All of the characters are spelled correctly (including Hogsmeade, McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Voldemort) and all in their correct capacity. For a pair of trolls, this is remarkably tame. In fact, there are only a bare handful of things that would even be catchable by spellcheck. My Immortal appears to have been *spellchecked*.

Chapters 11 and 12

And then everything goes insane. The error rate jumps from a little under 1%, most of it obviously intentional or understandable to a whopping 7.2%. Most people think that these chapters were reviewed by Raven before posting. The author’s note from 11 even thanks her: *AN: i sed stup flaming up prepz! c if dis chaptr is srupid!1111 it delz wit rly sris issus! sp c 4 urself if itz ztupid brw fangz 2 ma frend raven 4 hleping me!

Podcast version [https://unsettledtruecrime.podbean.com/](https://unsettledtruecrime.podbean.com/)

This is an update on Episode 1, Deanie Peters, which had its first major break since 1981. This episode will not only cover the arrest of JF, but will include additional and clarifying information mostly from the WZZM13 Investigates Facebook page. I will be covering all of the original information again in this episode. 

**INTRO**

The year is 1981. Ronald Reagan takes office, the first test tube baby is born, and MTV hits the airwaves.

That’s how long ago Deanie Peters disappeared. 

**THE DISAPPEARANCE**

Deanie was a 14 year old eighth grader attending her 6 year old brother W’s wrestling practice with her mom, M. M’s good friend A saw Deanie coming down the stairs at about 4:45 p.m as she arrived to pick up her son P, who had ridden to wrestling practice with the Peters family. Deanie waved to A and said she was going to the restroom and would be right back. 

That’s where this forty year old mystery begins.

The disappearance took place on February 5th 1981, at Forest Hill Central Middle School, which is in one of if not the safest neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I previously said elementary school, but that was not accurate. Even today people let their kids wander on bikes throughout the suburb. It’s a desirable area. This area is referred to in the news by many names, the general area of the city is called Forest Hills. Cascade is a prime street running through Forest Hills. The middle school is not far from Cascade.

The day of the disappearance, campus was busy. One facebook comment says they were there that day, and whatever happened must have been quick with all the activity.

There were about 75 people in total in the two level gym. The upper level held the wrestling meet. Photos of the wrestling team cannot be found in yearbooks because it was not a Forest Hills Public School System event. Their wrestling program wasn’t large enough, so children from any district were allowed to join. Matches were random rather than by school. 

The lower level of the gym had an aerobics class taking place.

The highschool, which shares a campus with the middle school, had a ‘donkey basketball game’ about two hours after the disappearance, which is where you actually dress up as donkeys and play basketball. There is no solid record of who participated in the game. 

**THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION**

**RUNAWAY**

Initially when Deanie did not return, not too much alarm was raised. It was thought she might have stopped to view another school event. The school was thoroughly searched. 

Police were called at 6:42p.m. This would have been roughly when the donkey basketball game was beginning at the high school. Police, though, thought Deanie might have run away to go live with her father and four siblings in California, despite her leaving pretty much everything behind including her savings. The lead detective assigned to the case, KK, had spent 5 years tracing runaway children. A classmate of Deanie’s said back in 1981 that Deanie did spend the night at a friend's house after arguing with her parents on more than one occasion. 

**NOT A RUNAWAY**

After 24 hours without contact from Deanie, search efforts intensified. Volunteers scoured nearby areas. Searches were conducted by helicopter and horseback. Parents waiting in the parking lot said they did not see Deanie, or anything out of the ordinary. Children from the school were interviewed in groups. Some children had not been aware anyone had disappeared until the following day. The community tied ribbons around trees and organized searches. 

After two weeks, no evidence had been found. A drawing of a possible suspect was made but never released to the public. 

**HYPNOSIS SIGHTING**

A woman on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class that day and says she saw Deanie and another girl walk across the gym heading to the girls room. This may be the same person who told investigators under hypnosis that they saw Deanie at 5:10p.m. walking inside the school with another girl, who had dark, shoulder length hair. This girl has yet to be identified. 

Rumors about the school incinerator were dispelled. Deanie’s stepfather J, and the school custodian AD were ruled out as suspects. 

**AD**

AD was approached by M and J at the school, and offered his condolences. He said he told them the same thing he told investigators; That three high school aged boys, one in a green and white Forest Hills Central letter jacket, banged on the locked doors of the school to be let in during the practice. AD did not recognize the boys as students, and refused. M said she does not remember this conversation. AD passed away in 2013. 

**MAN WATCHING AEROBICS**

A tip was received about a man standing in the doorway watching the aerobics class. Police found this man, who said he was waiting for his girlfriend, a part time music teacher at the school. Police could not connect him to Deanie. Witnesses disagree on if this was actually the man seen that night. One person on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class and not have seen any unusual man, suggesting he may have looked like he fit in. 

**PHONE CALLS**

Two odd phone calls were received by friends of Deanie’s, three days apart. One was around 8:30p.m.on a Wednesday to a close family friend. There was only a whimpering sound. When asked if it was Deanie, the caller hung up.

The second call was on February 28th to GD. GD was the nickname of Deanie’s boyfriend, Larry, who she mentioned in a letter to her dad. He was 17 at the time of dating Deanie, but told the papers he was 15 to avoid looking bad. The call was long-distance, from a girl who called herself “Beth”. GD wasn’t home to take the call and his mother declined to accept the charges. 

A close friend of Deanie’s also claims to have received several hang up calls, primarily late at night. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION**

In 2008 the Kent County Metro Cold Case Team was formed thanks to efforts by A. Some people asked how A is connected to this case. She’s the last person left in Grand Rapids to push the case. Deanie’s family ultimately moved away from the area.  

Over 400 interviews were conducted, 7 states visited, and up to 15 possible burial sites were searched. These include a Young Marines camp in Keene township, an area in Montcalm County, an area near Whitneyville and 92nd Ave, a shallow pond along Grand River Drive, and a mound of rocks. 

An age progression of Deanie is available in our source material.

Initially it was believed no one saw Deanie on her way to the restroom. However, a student may have said hello to her as she walked toward the bathroom. Deanie may have also been seen walking near the back door of the school with another girl. Someone reportedly saw a girl matching Deanie’s description willingly get into a car in the middle school parking lot. 

The disappearance was reconstructed. Efforts were focused on JF, KF, and SO. All three graduated from Caledonia High School. 

**J.O.F &amp; J.E.F.**

One woman claimed while canoeing in 1989, a man named J.O.F. talked about how he and two others hit a girl named Deanie with their car in a school parking lot. They put her in the trunk, and buried her along the Flat River. The two other men are rumored to be J.E.F. of the same last name and DM. According to rumors all three were friends of a man named BB. One person believes Jeff F and someone named GP  were involved, and mentions a long winding road that takes you to a property by a forest with a pond owned by one of the two men, who travelled often for work in a truck. J.E.F. allegedly has a violent history and a history with law enforcement. J.E.F. was married to MO. MO’s brother allegedly knew Deanie. 

This person also says that after Brent’s interview with M, M could no longer find Deanie’s horse collection from her bedroom. I’m not sure, but they may be referring to Brent Ashcroft who covered Deanie’s story with WZZM 13. 

**BB**

J.O.F. told detectives in the early 90s that he heard BB talk about killing Deanie while drunk and crying at a kegger near the sod farms off Grand River Drive near Lowell, and that she was buried near the old one room schoolhouse. This tip was investigated with no luck. 

BB may have been married to J.O.F.’s relative, Beth. Beth is the same name as the girl who called GD collect in the weeks after the disappearance, it’s unknown if that is connected. 

Investigators were never able to rule BB out as a suspect. He was 17 and living in Lowell at the time. The common rumor is that BB saw Deanie and drove his car at her to scare her, hit a patch of ice, and accidentally ran over and killed her. It’s thought Deanie may have left the school to smoke a cigarette.

BB reportedly confessed to the killing to somewhere between 20 and 30 people who did not believe him. 

His first wife called BB violent and abusive, and said he would sometimes black out after drinking with no memory. She claims he once pushed her out of a moving vehicle and broke her ankle, and another time threatened to run her off the road. 

In a phone interview, BB said he had a dream about Deanie after seeing her story on TV, but said he had never actually met her. He couldn't remember details about the dream, only that he told friends about it, and it somehow snowballed into how he had killed Deanie, maybe hit her with his car or truck, and buried her. 

A facebook comment claims BB had to leave to Somerset after being harassed by police and possibly refused to come back even for a family funeral. 

Here’s a quote from BB, back when he owned a repair shop: quote ""When I was a kid, I used to have this mental telepathy thing. I could tell things, like when a bird comes into your house and tells you someone's going to die. Everybody just keeps carrying it different ways."" end quote.

I looked up the bird comment, and a bird flying into a closed window is considered to be a bad omen, typically that someone will die. I believe BB was saying he had a sense for bad omens. 

BB died of a heart attack in 2008 before being questioned by the Cold Case Team. I previously said BB had never been interviewed in regards to Deanie, that was not accurate. KK received a tip about BB a few weeks after the disappearance, and interviewed BB two or three months after the disappearance. BB said he had nothing to do with it, and they had nothing to hold him. 

**THE ALTERCATION**

It was discovered that two days before her disappearance, Deanie had an altercation with at least two other girls over a boy, possibly BB, where they told her to stay away from him. It may or may not have been physical. Those involved were identified and interviewed by police. 

**THE DIARY**

In 2008, KK was subpoenaed for the return of Deanie’s Diary. After retirement, KK had focused his efforts on solving Deanie’s case, along with A. He says the diary was returned to M, but M does not recall receiving it. KK also says he read the diary very closely and there was nothing useful in it. However, that comment was made before KK learned of the confrontation Deanie had in the days before her death. 

KK alleged that several witnesses claim they gave statements, and that information was never passed on to him. Detectives repeatedly took statements, but did not file reports. 

**CORRUPTION**

**AD**

Sgt. CB says he was unable to track all potential leads in Deanie’s case. This includes being unable to fly to Arizona to interview Deanie’s mother and stepfather, and being unable to interview the school custodian AD. However, the press found AD living about a mile from the Sheriff's department, where he had lived for the past 15 years. 

AD believed the police targeted him for being hispanic. He was locked in a cell overnight and made to testify in front of a grand jury about a month after the disappearance. His only criminal record at the time was for drinking and driving. He stated he was cleaning a school office the night of the disappearance and never saw Deanie. AD said he was never asked to give a description or look at mugshots regarding the three boys he refused to let in the building.

**FRYLING**

Sgt. CB also claimed to have faced roadblocks in the investigation of the 1993 murder of millionaire Robert Fryling. There is essentially nothing online about the case, I had to reach out to the local library to get details. 

Robert Fryling was the well connected and influential owner of Fryling Construction in the 90s. His stepdaughter Maria married Doug DeVos, son of Amway’s Rich DeVos Sr.  Robert had a reputation as a loving husband and family man, when he was suddenly murdered in his 6,400 square foot home. 

The Fryling case went unsolved for eight years until Pietro Terrel and Christine VanMeter were arrested in 2001 with the help of a retired FBI agent, who was reportedly paid the equivalent of $54,000 per year as a cold case investigator. Officials said in 2001 that the same investigator would be looking into Deanie's case. 

It came out that the pimp of a prostitute Fryling frequented decided to rob the millionaire client. 

Rumors say, detectives solved the high profile case right away back in the 90s, but intentionally left it publicly unsolved to prevent embarrassment to the influential family. 

Detective JC was quoted in 1995 as saying quote ""After two years,

nothing has surfaced to show anybody was mad at him.” End quote.

However, in Pietro’s 2004 appeal, the state of Michigan refers to interviews with Christine from 1993 about their plan to rob the home, as well as statements that seem to directly implicate they were involved in the murder. 

A commenter on facebook claims a woman connected with her to say she believed her father was involved in the disappearance of Deanie. They said the man was in the construction business and spent a lot of time at a hotel and bar in the 28th and East Paris area, possibly called the Spinnaker. His name may have been Rob. They say this tip was given to Silent Observer. 

The Spinnaker is a bar at the Hilton hotel at 28th and Patterson, which is not too far from the Fryling mansion near the corner of Kraft and Burton. However, it’s unclear if this person was referring to Fryling. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION**

The Cold Case team was disbanded in 2016. They believed there were several people living in West Michigan who knew what happened, but were unwilling to cooperate. They strongly believed a woman still living in the cascade area had knowledge of the disappearance. There were rumors the Cold Case Team had more information about what happened that could not be released to the public. According to a facebook comment, a Freedom of Information Act request could not be made because the case is still open.

**Facebook**

What you’re about to hear next, is all speculation I found on the WZZM 13 Investigates Facebook page for Deanie. 

It’s alleged that four high school girls were involved in the altercation with Deanie at the middle school. S, LM., LL, and DD. who is GD’s sister. 

**S**

S still lives in the area. She failed a lie detector test. Some rumors say she was in the car when BB ran over Deanie. S was not BB’s girlfriend at the time, a girl named Patty was. S has an Aunt S, who knows NB, BB’s mother.

S’s husband is the nephew of Detective JC. S allegedly called JC ‘uncle’ growing up. 

KK claimed that in 1981 three KCSD detectives, JC, CB, and JP searched a pond off Grand River Drive without him and never filed a report for the search. KK said Jack wanted to solve the case by himself without KK’s help. 

**KB**

KB is BB’s cousin and went to church with S and Aunt S. She says BB was not involved. He had no motive, and detectives tracked him for years to no avail.  It’s a small town and there are going to be connections between people. BB never owned any trucks as suspected by some, and the car he owned at the time was never in any accidents. He only got rid of the car because a cousin had used it in a B&amp;E. KB says Bruce did not have a crush on S. KB posted on facebook that S lives on the same property she grew up on which is near all her relatives, and says S, DD, and the L’s are still close friends. 

Below that post is a picture of some snow and sticks which says it is the Golf course down from Snow road and says quote “I know what it is and so do you.” This is likely the Snow Ave that was searched in 2020 by KK, the Michigan Paranormal Alliance, and Michigan SAR with canine handlers. They saw no change in the dogs.

KB goes on to say the picture is a 3x5 foot perfectly rectangular hole that has been untouched for 33 years, and says this was a party spot back in the day. They continue to say that Deanie is ‘of course’ not there, so I don’t know what KB believes the spot to be. 

BB and GD worked together at Metric Manufacturing in Lowell. This was confirmed by GT the V.P. of Metric according to KB. BB and GD were not friends and GT remembered BB being there in 82 or 83 before marrying Beth, but was unsure about 1981. It’s alleged that GT and GD were both upper management and are close friends. KB claims GT may have protected GD by not mentioning in 1981 that GD and BB worked together and by claiming to not have employment records from 1981. It’s also possible that GD had a previous relationship with one of the girls from the altercation. 

**FJ**

One facebook commenter, FJ, has a few bold blaims. Someone told him that he was with BB while moving the body. He says the local police are involved and corrupt. A human skull was found in the Detroit River, FJ wondered if it could be Deanie. They go on to suspect the Detroit case is being kept quiet. FJ continues to say that a man named KH. changed his name. He was the GD with the beagle in the photo on the front page of the Grand Rapids Press.Apparently KH was friends with BB and is the one who threw the skull into the Detroit River. A man named Eric M. is also involved. FJ claims to run “the knights page” and has access to information from KH. FJ also accuses Deanie’s sister of lying about random bits of her past, so he may be a terrible source of information. 

**MISC INFO**

Here are some miscellaneous details and theories about Deanie’s case. 

**TUNNELS**

There are reportedly tunnels under one wing of Central Middle School for heating access. 

**PRETTY COMMENTS**

The woman claiming to have seen Deanie with another girl mentioned on facebook that Deanie was particularly noticeable because she was pretty. AD made a similar comment, as well as several of Deanie’s classmates.

**BOX TRUCK**

A woman named J asked on facebook if anyone can recall a short box side step brown truck on the night of the disappearance, but there were no responses. 

**DK.**

Another person on facebook mentions DK. as a name possibly involved.

**CONSTRUCTION WORKERS**

A facebook thread was deleted over comments that Deanie may have flirted with construction workers and bummed cigarettes from them. There was some construction going on at the school at the time. 

**MISC THEORIES**

**PARTY**

One story is that Deanie ended up at a party on Cascade road. From there, one girl and three men took Deanie away, potentially to the old schoolhouse, and killed her there. I’m not sure this adds up, because the night Deanie disappeared, she was supposed to babysit for the Hart family. She had babysat in the past for A as well.

**ZAK**

Killer EZ, called Zak, was rumored to be romantically involved with Deanie since he attended the same school. This is unlikely as he did not live in Michigan at the time.

**RA**

Serial Killer RA is not believed to be involved.  

**JANE DOES**

Here are some potential Jane Doe’s.

Vidor Jane Doe was white, between ages 12 and 20, between 4 foot 6 and 5 foot 6. She was found in Vidor, Texas in 1984, believed to be around a year after her death in 1983. Sketches of Vidor look similar to Deanie.

Jane Doe 1985 from missingkids.org  was found in Jellico, Tennessee in 1985. She is estimated to be 10-14 years old and is believed to have passed away between 1981 and 1984. She had several silver fillings. Jellico is a straight shot down I-75 from Grand Rapids, and again the sketches look similar to Deanie. 

I-96 Jane was identified and is not Deanie. 

**JF**

A man on facebook named T posted information he claims came from a man named BP. BP worked with JF at JF Sign Co. and heard James tell KF not to worry about taking a lie detector test, that “she” passed hers by thinking of something else. A jealous girl was involved and a woman named Kathy said she spent time with KF and his mother on Kettle Lake back in the Day, and that KF considered Deanie his girlfriend. BP says he asked KF directly about Deanie in the early 2000’s, and with a trembling voice he said ‘I’m not the one that hurt that girl, BP.’ “ 

The same BP left a comment asking to put pressure on JF. He also says he thinks JF murdered KF. 

EF commented that she  was there when her father, KF, died and says the death was an accidental overdose. She says she never heard the name BB from her father and defended her father saying he ‘would never hurt a soul’ and never even hunted or fished.

On July 2nd, 2021, 40 years after Deanie Peters disappeared, JF was arrested for perjury in connection to her case. This is the first arrest investigators have made. There is no evidence connecting JF to the disappearance, however the assistant prosecutor is using investigative subpoenas to force witnesses to testify.

JF reportedly changed his story about SO, who he has known since childhood. JF testified that he never thought SOe had killed Deanie. However, he told detectives back in 2008 there were rumors about SO strangling and raping women. JF told detectives quote “SO might have been the one who did it.”end quote. SOe denied these claims. 

JF also denied telling anyone about the potential involvement of KF. KF worked off and on at JF’s sign shop in Caledonia. KF was Deanie’s boyfriend at one time, and according to his ex wife, he had a photo with a detailed love letter written on the back and signed by Deanie. ST, KF’s girlfriend from about 1999 to 2004, told the court that JF called her the day KF died in 2008 and told her, ‘Yeah, I think he (meaning KF) lived his life with drugs and alcohol because he felt guilty about killing Deanie Peters.” 

JF’s attorney argued that JF simply did not remember things clearly and did not knowingly lie. The judge said evidence showed JF had a “lengthy pattern” of false statements to investigators.

JF’s phone showed six calls and 201 texts between JF and SOe from May 24, 2021, to June 24, 2021. One call was one day before JF’s testimony and lasted eight minutes. Another call on June 1 waszz shortly after JF learned investigators were again interviewing witnesses in the case.That call lasted just over an hour and had been deleted from SO’s phone and did not appear on JF’s phone at all. During a call while JF was in jail, his son told him “SO ratted you out.” JF responded with, “How do you know?”

Court documents also allege that JF told other witnesses not to bring their cellphones when they appeared under subpoenas.

JF told investigators in 2002 that he was told by a friend that two other men were in a car in 1981 when Deanie Peters ran out from between parked cars and they struck and killed her, and that she was buried “in a shallow grave with her head toward the river.”

**WZZM**

The person maintaining the WZZM 13 Investigates facebook page retired on December 23rd, 2021. It’s unclear if the page will be maintained. 

WZZM interviewed several key people in this case, including KK, A, M, and RA, who was the last known person to speak to Deanie on her way to the bathroom. However, the web page hosting these interviews has been taken down. Several of my source articles from Episode 1 were also removed. I tried contacting the station to see if they were still available but received no response. 

Investigation Discovery was reportedly going to pick up the case, but it was dropped when producers changed. 

John Walsh picked up Deanie as a February Missing Child. 

**ENDING**

Deanie is remembered as being bubbly and encouraging. Although she wanted to be a model, M believed Deanie would have been a veterinarian. Deanie had a short article published about her eighth grade trip to camp. She says of her peers, quote “They learned the importance of simply trying, trusting their friends, and overcoming their fears.” end quote. 

KK reportedly kept Deanie’s photo in his wallet until he passed away. Students at FHC still write papers about Deanie. William said of his sister's unknown killer, “I think it’s almost worse than prison, because they’ve had to live with it their whole lives.” 

Deanie was declared legally dead in 1991. Her father D passed away in 2017. M and J have moved to Arizona, where they still have a bedroom for Deanie recreated exactly the way she left it. They desperately want to lay Deanie to rest. 

The investigation is open and active as of 2021.

The statute of limitations has expired on all charges except murder. There is a $25,000 cash reward for any credible information about what happened or Deanie’s remains. You can contact CrimeStoppers to remain completely anonymous at 1800 Speak Up, or the Kent County Sheriff’s Department at 616-632-6100.

&amp;#x200B;

This is an update on Episode 1, Deanie Peters, which had its first major break since 1981. This episode will not only cover the arrest of James Frisbie, but will include additional and clarifying information mostly from the WZZM13 Investigates Facebook page. I will be covering all of the original information again in this episode. 

**INTRO**

The year is 1981. Ronald Reagan takes office, the first test tube baby is born, and MTV hits the airwaves.

That’s how long ago Deanie Peters disappeared. 

**THE DISAPPEARANCE**

Deanie was a 14 year old eighth grader attending her 6 year old brother William’s wrestling practice with her mom, Mary. Mary’s good friend Ariadyne saw Deanie coming down the stairs at about 4:45 p.m as she arrived to pick up her son Paul, who had ridden to wrestling practice with the Peters family. Deanie waved to Ariadyne and said she was going to the restroom and would be right back. 

That’s where this forty year old mystery begins.

The disappearance took place on February 5th 1981, at Forest Hill Central Middle School, which is in one of if not the safest neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I previously said elementary school, but that was not accurate. Even today people let their kids wander on bikes throughout the suburb. It’s a desirable area. This area is referred to in the news by many names, the general area of the city is called Forest Hills. Cascade is a primary street running through Forest Hills. The middle school is not far from Cascade.

The day of the disappearance, campus was busy. One facebook comment says they were there that day, and whatever happened must have been quick with all the activity.

There were about 75 people in total in the two level gym. The upper level held the wrestling meet. Photos of the wrestling team cannot be found in yearbooks because it was not a Forest Hills Public School System event. Their wrestling program wasn’t large enough, so children from any district were allowed to join. Matches were random rather than by school. 

The lower level of the gym had an aerobics class taking place.

The highschool, which shares a campus with the middle school, had a ‘donkey basketball game’ about two hours after the disappearance, which is where you actually dress up as donkeys and play basketball. There is no solid record of who participated in the game. 

**THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION**

**RUNAWAY**

Initially when Deanie did not return, not too much alarm was raised. It was thought she might have stopped to view another school event. The school was thoroughly searched. 

Police were called at 6:42p.m. This would have been roughly when the donkey basketball game was beginning at the high school. Police, though, thought Deanie might have run away to go live with her father and four siblings in California, despite her leaving pretty much everything behind including her savings. The lead detective assigned to the case, Ken Kleinheksel, had spent 5 years tracing runaway children. A classmate of Deanie’s said back in 1981 that Deanie did spend the night at a friend's house after arguing with her parents on more than one occasion. 

**NOT A RUNAWAY**

After 24 hours without contact from Deanie, search efforts intensified. Volunteers scoured nearby areas. Searches were conducted by helicopter and horseback. Parents waiting in the parking lot said they did not see Deanie, or anything out of the ordinary. Children from the school were interviewed in groups. Some children had not been aware anyone had disappeared until the following day. The community tied ribbons around trees and organized searches. 

After two weeks, no evidence had been found. A drawing of a possible suspect was made but never released to the public. 

**HYPNOSIS SIGHTING**

A woman on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class that day and says she saw Deanie and another girl walk across the gym heading to the girls room. This may be the same person who told investigators under hypnosis that they saw Deanie at 5:10p.m. walking inside the school with another girl, who had dark, shoulder length hair. This girl has yet to be identified. 

Rumors about the school incinerator were dispelled. Deanie’s stepfather John, and the school custodian Arthur Diaz were ruled out as suspects. 

**ARTHUR DIAZ**

Arthur was approached by Mary and John at the school, and offered his condolences. He said he told them the same thing he told investigators; That three high school aged boys, one in a green and white Forest Hills Central letter jacket, banged on the locked doors of the school to be let in during the practice. Arthur did not recognize the boys as students, and refused. Mary said she does not remember this conversation. Arthur passed away in 2013. 

**MAN WATCHING AEROBICS**

A tip was received about a man standing in the doorway watching the aerobics class. Police found this man, who said he was waiting for his girlfriend, a part time music teacher at the school. Police could not connect him to Deanie. Witnesses disagree on if this was actually the man seen that night. One person on facebook claims to have been at the aerobics class and not have seen any unusual man, suggesting he may have looked like he fit in. 

**PHONE CALLS**

Two odd phone calls were received by friends of Deanie’s, three days apart. One was around 8:30p.m.on a Wednesday to a close family friend. There was only a whimpering sound. When asked if it was Deanie, the caller hung up.

The second call was on February 28th to Guy. Guy was the nickname of Deanie’s boyfriend, Larry, who she mentioned in a letter to her dad. He was 17 at the time of dating Deanie, but told the papers he was 15 to avoid looking bad. The call was long-distance, from a girl who called herself “Beth”. Guy wasn’t home to take the call and his mother declined to accept the charges. 

A close friend of Deanie’s also claims to have received several hang up calls, primarily late at night. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION**

In 2008 the Kent County Metro Cold Case Team was formed thanks to efforts by Ariadyne. Some people asked how Ariadyne is connected to this case. She’s the last person left in Grand Rapids to push the case. Deanie’s family ultimately moved away from the area.  

Over 400 interviews were conducted, 7 states visited, and up to 15 possible burial sites were searched. These include a Young Marines camp in Keene township, an area in Montcalm County, an area near Whitneyville and 92nd Ave, a shallow pond along Grand River Drive, and a mound of rocks. 

An age progression of Deanie is available in our source material.

Initially it was believed no one saw Deanie on her way to the restroom. However, a student may have said hello to her as she walked toward the bathroom. Deanie may have also been seen walking near the back door of the school with another girl. Someone reportedly saw a girl matching Deanie’s description willingly get into a car in the middle school parking lot. 

The disappearance was reconstructed. Efforts were focused on James Frisbie, Kyle Fate, and Steve Osborn. All three graduated from Caledonia High School. 

**JOE &amp; JEFF F.** 

One woman claimed while canoeing in 1989, a man named Joe F. talked about how he and two others hit a girl named Deanie with their car in a school parking lot. They put her in the trunk, and buried her along the Flat River. The two other men are rumored to be Jeff F. of the same last name and Dean M. According to rumors all three were friends of a man named Bruce Bunch. One person believes Jeff F and someone named Greg P  were involved, and mentions a long winding road that takes you to a property by a forest with a pond owned by one of the two men, who travelled often for work in a truck. Jeff F. allegedly has a violent history and a history with law enforcement. Jeff F. was married to Margo. Margo’s brother allegedly knew Deanie. 

This person also says that after Brent’s interview with Mary, Mary could no longer find Deanie’s horse collection from her bedroom. I’m not sure, but they may be referring to Brent Ashcroft who covered Deanie’s story with WZZM 13. 

**BRUCE BUNCH**

Joe F. told detectives in the early 90s that he heard Bruce Bunch talk about killing Deanie while drunk and crying at a kegger near the sod farms off Grand River Drive near Lowell, and that she was buried near the old one room schoolhouse. This tip was investigated with no luck. 

Bunch may have been married to Joseph F.’s relative, Beth. Beth is the same name as the girl who called Guy collect in the weeks after the disappearance, it’s unknown if that is connected. 

Investigators were never able to rule Bunch out as a suspect. He was 17 and living in Lowell at the time. The common rumor is that Bunch saw Deanie and drove his car at her to scare her, hit a patch of ice, and accidentally ran over and killed her. It’s thought Deanie may have left the school to smoke a cigarette.

Bunch reportedly confessed to the killing to somewhere between 20 and 30 people who did not believe him. 

His first wife called Bunch violent and abusive, and said he would sometimes black out after drinking with no memory. She claims he once pushed her out of a moving vehicle and broke her ankle, and another time threatened to run her off the road. 

In a phone interview, Bunch said he had a dream about Deanie after seeing her story on TV, but said he had never actually met her. He couldn't remember details about the dream, only that he told friends about it, and it somehow snowballed into how he had killed Deanie, maybe hit her with his car or truck, and buried her. 

A facebook comment claims Bunch had to leave to Somerset after being harassed by police and possibly refused to come back even for a family funeral. 

Here’s a quote from Bunch, back when he owned a repair shop: quote ""When I was a kid, I used to have this mental telepathy thing. I could tell things, like when a bird comes into your house and tells you someone's going to die. Everybody just keeps carrying it different ways."" end quote.

I looked up the bird comment, and a bird flying into a closed window is considered to be a bad omen, typically that someone will die. I believe Bunch was saying he had a sense for bad omens. 

Bunch died of a heart attack in 2008 before being questioned by the Cold Case Team. I previously said Bunch had never been interviewed in regards to Deanie, that was not accurate. Ken Kleinheksel received a tip about Bunch a few weeks after the disappearance, and interviewed Bunch two or three months after the disappearance. Bunch said he had nothing to do with it, and they had nothing to hold him. 

**THE ALTERCATION**

It was discovered that two days before her disappearance, Deanie had an altercation with at least two other girls over a boy, possibly Bruce Bunch, where they told her to stay away from him. It may or may not have been physical. Those involved were identified and interviewed by police. 

**THE DIARY**

In 2008, Ken was subpoenaed for the return of Deanie’s Diary. After retirement, Ken had focused his efforts on solving Deanie’s case, along with Ariadyne. He says the diary was returned to Mary, but Mary does not recall receiving it. Ken also says he read the diary very closely and there was nothing useful in it. However, that comment was made before Ken learned of the confrontation Deanie had in the days before her death. 

Ken alleged that several witnesses claim they gave statements, and that information was never passed on to him. Detectives repeatedly took statements, but did not file reports. 

**CORRUPTION**

**ARTHUR DIAZ**

Sgt. Chet Bush says he was unable to track all potential leads in Deanie’s case. This includes being unable to fly to Arizona to interview Deanie’s mother and stepfather, and being unable to interview the school custodian Arthur Diaz. However, the press found Arthur living about a mile from the Sheriff's department, where he had lived for the past 15 years. 

Arthur Diaz believed the police targeted him for being hispanic. He was locked in a cell overnight and made to testify in front of a grand jury about a month after the disappearance. His only criminal record at the time was for drinking and driving. He stated he was cleaning a school office the night of the disappearance and never saw Deanie. Arthur said he was never asked to give a description or look at mugshots regarding the three boys he refused to let in the building.

**FRYLING**

Sgt. Chet Bush also claimed to have faced roadblocks in the investigation of the 1993 murder of millionaire Robert Fryling. There is essentially nothing online about the case, I had to reach out to the local library to get details. 

Robert Fryling was the well connected and influential owner of Fryling Construction in the 90s. His stepdaughter Maria married Doug DeVos, son of Amway’s Rich DeVos Sr.  Robert had a reputation as a loving husband and family man, when he was suddenly murdered in his 6,400 square foot home. 

The Fryling case went unsolved for eight years until Pietro Terrel and Christine VanMeter were arrested in 2001 with the help of a retired FBI agent, who was reportedly paid the equivalent of $54,000 per year as a cold case investigator. Officials said in 2001 that the same investigator would be looking into Deanie's case. 

It came out that the pimp of a prostitute Fryling frequented decided to rob the millionaire client. 

Rumors say, detectives solved the high profile case right away back in the 90s, but intentionally left it publicly unsolved to prevent embarrassment to the influential family. 

Detective Jack Christensen was quoted in 1995 as saying quote ""After two years,

nothing has surfaced to show anybody was mad at him.” End quote.

However, in Pietro’s 2004 appeal, the state of Michigan refers to interviews with Christine from 1993 about their plan to rob the home, as well as statements that seem to directly implicate they were involved in the murder. 

A commenter on facebook claims a woman connected with her to say she believed her father was involved in the disappearance of Deanie. They said the man was in the construction business and spent a lot of time at a hotel and bar in the 28th and East Paris area, possibly called the Spinnaker. His name may have been Rob. They say this tip was given to Silent Observer. 

The Spinnaker is a bar at the Hilton hotel at 28th and Patterson, which is not too far from the Fryling mansion near the corner of Kraft and Burton. However, it’s unclear if this person was referring to Fryling. 

**THE COLD CASE INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION**

The Cold Case team was disbanded in 2016. They believed there were several people living in West Michigan who knew what happened, but were unwilling to cooperate. They strongly believed a woman still living in the cascade area had knowledge of the disappearance. There were rumors the Cold Case Team had more information about what happened that could not be released to the public. According to a facebook comment, a Freedom of Information Act request could not be made because the case is still open.

**Facebook**

What you’re about to hear next, is all speculation I found on the WZZM 13 Investigates Facebook page for Deanie. 

It’s alleged that four high school girls were involved in the altercation with Deanie at the middle school. Sue, Lori M., Lori L, and Debbie D. who is Guy’s sister. 

**SUE**

Sue still lives in the area. She failed a lie detector test. Some rumors say she was in the car when Bunch ran over Deanie. Sue was not Bunch’s girlfriend at the time, a girl named Patty was. Sue has an Aunt Sandy, who knows Naomi Bunch, Bruce’s mother.

Sue’s husband is the nephew of Detective Jack Christensen. Sue allegedly called Jack ‘uncle’ growing up. 

Ken claimed that in 1981 three KCSD detectives, Jack Christensen, Chet Bush, and Jim Porter, searched a pond off Grand River Drive without him and never filed a report for the search. Ken said Jack wanted to solve the case by himself without Ken’s help. 

**KIRBY**

Kirby is Bruce Bunch’s cousin and went to church with Sue and Sandy. She says Bunch was not involved. He had no motive, and detectives tracked him for years to no avail.  It’s a small town and there are going to be connections between people. Bunch never owned any trucks as suspected by some, and the car he owned at the time was never in any accidents. He only got rid of the car because a cousin had used it in a B&amp;E. Kirby says Bruce did not have a crush on Sue. Kirby posted on facebook that Sue lives on the same property she grew up on which is near all her relatives, and says Sue, Deb, and the Lori’s are still close friends. 

Below that post is a picture of some snow and sticks which says it is the Golf course down from Snow road and says quote “I know what it is and so do you.” This is likely the Snow Ave that was searched in 2020 by Ken, the Michigan Paranormal Alliance, and Michigan SAR with canine handlers. They saw no change in the dogs.

Kirby goes on to say the picture is a 3x5 foot perfectly rectangular hole that has been untouched for 33 years, and says this was a party spot back in the day. They continue to say that Deanie is ‘of course’ not there, so I don’t know what Kirby believes the spot to be. 

Bunch and Guy worked together at Metric Manufacturing in Lowell. This was confirmed by Greg Thomas the V.P. of Metric according to Kirby. Bunch and Guy were not friends and Greg remembered Bunch being there in 82 or 83 before marrying Beth, but was unsure about 1981. It’s alleged that Thomas and Guy Dalke were both upper management and are close friends. Kirby claims Thomas may have protected Guy by not mentioning in 1981 that Guy and Bunch worked together and by claiming to not have employment records from 1981. It’s also possible that Guy had a previous relationship with one of the girls from the altercation. 

**FACEBOOK JOE**

One facebook commenter, Facebook Joe, has a few bold blaims. Someone told him that he was with Bunch while moving the body. He says the local police are involved and corrupt. A human skull was found in the Detroit River, Facebook Joe wondered if it could be Deanie. They go on to suspect the Detroit case is being kept quiet. Facebook Joe continues to say that a man named Ken H. changed his name. He was the guy with the beagle in the photo on the front page of the Grand Rapids Press.Apparently Ken H. was friends with Bunch and is the one who threw the skull into the Detroit River. A man named Eric M. is also involved. Facebook Joe claims to run “the knights page” and has access to information from Ken. Facebook Joe also accuses Deanie’s sister of lying about random bits of her past, so he may be a terrible source of information. 

**MISC INFO**

Here are some miscellaneous details and theories about Deanie’s case. 

**TUNNELS**

There are reportedly tunnels under one wing of Central Middle School for heating access. 

**PRETTY COMMENTS**

The woman claiming to have seen Deanie with another girl mentioned on facebook that Deanie was particularly noticeable because she was pretty. Arthur Diaz made a similar comment, as well as several of Deanie’s classmates.

**BOX TRUCK**

A woman named Jennifer asked on facebook if anyone can recall a short box side step brown truck on the night of the disappearance, but there were no responses. 

**DONNY K.**

Another person on facebook mentions Donny K. as a name possibly involved.

**CONSTRUCTION WORKERS**

A facebook thread was deleted over comments that Deanie may have flirted with construction workers and bummed cigarettes from them. THere was some construction going on at the school at the time. 

**MISC THEORIES**

**PARTY**

One story is that Deanie ended up at a party on Cascade road. From there, one girl and three men took Deanie away, potentially to the old schoolhouse, and killed her there. I’m not sure this adds up, because the night Deanie disappeared, she was supposed to babysit for the Hart family. She had babysat in the past for Ariadyne as well.

**ZAK**

Killer Edward Zakrzewski, called Zak, was rumored to be romantically involved with Deanie since he attended the same school. This is unlikely as he did not live in Michigan at the time.

**ANDREWS**

Serial Killer Ralph Andrews is not believed to be involved.  

**JANE DOES**

Here are some potential Jane Doe’s.

Vidor Jane Doe was white, between ages 12 and 20, between 4 foot 6 and 5 foot 6. She was found in Vidor, Texas in 1984, believed to be around a year after her death in 1983. Sketches of Vidor look similar to Deanie.

Jane Doe 1985 from missingkids.org  was found in Jellico, Tennessee in 1985. She is estimated to be 10-14 years old and is believed to have passed away between 1981 and 1984. She had several silver fillings. Jellico is a straight shot down I-75 from Grand Rapids, and again the sketches look similar to Deanie. 

I-96 Jane was identified and is not Deanie. 

**JAMES FRISBIE**

A man on facebook named Tyler posted information he claims came from a man named Bob P. Bob worked with James Frisbie at Frisbie Sign Co. and heard James tell Kyle Fate not to worry about taking a lie detector test, that “she” passed hers by thinking of something else. A jealous girl was involved and a woman named Kathy said she spent time with Kyle and his mother on Kettle Lake back in the Day, and that Kyle considered Deanie his girlfriend. Bob says he asked Kyle directly about Deanie in the early 2000’s, and with a trembling voice he said ‘I’m not the one that hurt that girl, Bob.’ “ 

The same Bob P. left a comment asking to put pressure on James Frisbie. He also says he thinks James Frisbie murdered Kyle Fate. 

Emily Fate commented that she  was there when her father, Kyle, died and says the death was an accidental overdose. She says she never heard the name Bruce Bunch from her father and defended her father saying he ‘would never hurt a soul’ and never even hunted or fished.

On July 2nd, 2021, 40 years after Deanie Peters disappeared, James Frisbie was arrested for perjury in connection to her case. This is the first arrest investigators have made. There is no evidence connecting Frisbie to the disappearance, however the assistant prosecutor is using investigative subpoenas to force witnesses to testify.

Frisbie reportedly changed his story about Steve Osborne, who he has known since childhood. Frisbie testified that he never thought Osborne had killed Deanie. However, he told detectives back in 2008 there were rumors about Osborn strangling and raping women. Frisbie told detectives quote “Steve might have been the one who did it.”end quote. Osborne denied these claims. 

Frisbie also denied telling anyone about the potential involvement of Kyle Fate. Fate worked off and on at Frisbie’s sign shop in Caledonia. Fate was Deanie’s boyfriend at one time, and according to his ex wife, he had a photo with a detailed love letter written on the back and signed by Deanie. Susan Timmer, Fate’s girlfriend from about 1999 to 2004, told the court that Frisbie called her the day Fate died in 2008 and told her, ‘Yeah, I think he (meaning Fate) lived his life with drugs and alcohol because he felt guilty about killing Deanie Peters.” 

Frisbie’s attorney argued that Frisbie simply did not remember things clearly and did not knowingly lie. The judge said evidence showed Frisbie had a “lengthy pattern” of false statements to investigators.

Frisbie’s phone showed six calls and 201 texts between Frisbie and Osborne from May 24, 2021, to June 24, 2021. One call was one day before Frisbie’s testimony and lasted eight minutes. Another call on June 1 waszz shortly after Frisbie learned investigators were again interviewing witnesses in the case.That call lasted just over an hour and had been deleted from Steve Osborne’s phone and did not appear on Frisbie’s phone at all. During a call while Frisbie was in jail, his son told him “Steve ratted you out.” Frisbie responded with, “How do you know?”

Court documents also allege that Frisbie told other witnesses not to bring their cellphones when they appeared under subpoenas.

Frisbie told investigators in 2002 that he was told by a friend that two other men were in a car in 1981 when Deanie Peters ran out from between parked cars and they struck and killed her, and that she was buried “in a shallow grave with her head toward the river.”

**WZZM**

The person maintaining the WZZM 13 Investigates facebook page retired on December 23rd, 2021. It’s unclear if the page will be maintained. 

WZZM interviewed several key people in this case, including Ken, Ariadyne, Mary, and Robert Alexander, who was the last known person to speak to Deanie on her way to the bathroom. However, the web page hosting these interviews has been taken down. Several of my source articles from Episode 1 were also removed. I tried contacting the station to see if they were still available but received no response. 

Investigation Discovery was reportedly going to pick up the case, but it was dropped when producers changed. 

John Walsh picked up Deanie as a February Missing Child. 

**ENDING**

Deanie is remembered as being bubbly and encouraging. Although she wanted to be a model, Mary believed Deanie would have been a veterinarian. Deanie had a short article published about her eighth grade trip to camp. She says of her peers, quote “They learned the importance of simply trying, trusting their friends, and overcoming their fears.” end quote. 

Ken Klienheksel reportedly kept Deanie’s photo in his wallet until he passed away. Students at FHC still write papers about Deanie. William said of his sister's unknown killer, “I think it’s almost worse than prison, because they’ve had to live with it their whole lives.” 

Deanie was declared legally dead in 1991. Her father Duane passed away in 2017. Mary and John have moved to Arizona, where they still have a bedroom for Deanie recreated exactly the way she left it. They desperately want to lay Deanie to rest. 

The investigation is open and active as of 2021.

The statute of limitations has expired on all charges except murder. There is a $25,000 cash reward for any credible information about what happened or Deanie’s remains. You can contact CrimeStoppers to remain completely anonymous at 1800 Speak Up, or the Kent County Sheriff’s Department at 616-632-6100.

121,ImTheFuckinCommander,1642154223,"Hi

Are there killers who hadn't killed innocent people and instead focused on

 bad guys like abusers other killers murderers 

Killed their abusers.

I watched dexter and I'm curious if this type of killer is possible cause he is clearly a sociopath. One of the driving factors of his narrative is his inability to feel normal, human emotions. He does care for people, but on a distant level. Heck, several times in the novel he refers to himself as a sociopath. 

For example gypsy rose killed her abuser technically gypsy Rose Blanchard's mother, Dee Dee, falsely claimed her daughter was suffering from different illnesses until Gypsy arranged for her boyfriend to kill her mother in 2015.


Aileen Wuornos

Peter Sutcliffe, the serial killer known as the Yorkshire Ripper, is expected to die any moment, I think about monsters like him, and how his murderous reign of terror left its stamp not just on the victims and their loved ones, but on women everywhere.

There are monsters, though, and there are misrepresentations. Can we even begin to compare a man who rapes, murders and defiles the bodies of his female victims to Aileen Wuornos, a woman who perfectly fit the profile of a victim of a serial killer such as Sutcliffe —  but who, instead, has been represented as his female counterpart? They even made a film about her: Monster.

127,LeVraiNord,1642145243,"27 year old [Kelly Morrisseau](https://meurtresetdisparitions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kelly-Morrisseau-4-1.jpg) was killed on 10 Décember 2006 in Gatineau, Quebec.

She was found naked in parking lot P3 in Gatineau Park, north of the intersection of Prom. de la Gatineau and Gamelin Street, at 5:40 am by a man walking his dog. She was still alive, but died in the hospital later that morning from stab wounds. Police say that she fought for her and her baby's life 'vigorously', so much so that they believe her killer may have been wounded. [Here is a very good poster with her information, maps, and a summary.](https://i0.wp.com/www.mollymatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kelly-morriseau-map-molly-matters.jpg)

She had been living in Vanier, an area in Ottawa, Canada and was last seen leaving a Montfort Street apartment in the area at 4 am. Police say she was with a man, and was seen getting into his car, possibly a 1985 to 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera or Calais. The police believe the suspect could have been seen in the area in the days leading up to the murder, looking for prostitutes. The police released [a sketch](https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2021/12/10/morrisseau-composite-suspect-1-5702593-1639162807998.jpeg) of this man in 2007. On [this map](http://www.worldeasyguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Map-of-Gatineau.jpg) you can see Vanier (eastern side of Ottawa) and Gatineau. [Here is a close-up map](http://ncc-website-2.s3.amazonaws.com/images/GP-Parkways_nightly-closures-map.jpg?mtime=20190415163225) of the park, where you can see P3 in the lower right quadrant. Ottawa is in eastern Ontario, Canada, and borders Gatineau, western Quebec.

Authorities tracked the suspect's movements and believe he used a lane reserved for emergency vehicles between Prom. de la Gatineau and Boul. Saint-Raymond. Some items belonging to her were found on Rue des Frenes, near Boul. du Plateau, and behind Starcite Cinema, at 115 Boul. du Plateau. Additional items were recovered from a nearby brook. Police believe the suspect drove around the area and likely stepped out of his vehicle multiple times during that time.

Morrisseau was originally from Sagkeeng First Nations in Manitoba. She had 3 children and was 7 months pregnant at the time of her murder. Before she was killed, she was trying to turn her life around so she could be reunited with her children, who'd been taken by the province's child services in October 2005 (\~a year earlier). An acquaintance had introduced Morrisseau to crack cocaine, forcing her into prostitution, and her life had spiraled into drugs/alcohol. Evidence suggests she may have exchanged money with the suspect and that he may have solicited other women before/after the murder.

The suspect is described as a white male aged 24-30 with an athletic build. He would now be 40-46 years old. He had short, blond, curly hair. He was 5'8 - 5'10 and weighs 180-200 lbs. He speaks English and French without an accent. To me, this suggests a fully bilingual person, but this is not uncommon in Northern and Eastern Ontario, some of Manitoba and New Brunswick, and parts of Quebec.

This is the first of some posts I'll be sharing on francophone disappearances/murders in Canada (possibly other francophone countries as well).

ANDOVER — It has been nearly a decade since Holly Senykoff and John Magee’s parents, John and Geraldine Magee, were found murdered in their Andover home.

As the anniversary nears, Senykoff and Magee are once again asking for assistance from anyone who might recall even the smallest detail to help solve the case.

“It’s been almost 10 years since the tragic deaths of Jack and Jeri Magee. Our family has lost 10 years of love, smiles, wisdom, support and happiness with them. For the past decade, we have hoped and prayed for answers and closure to this horrible crime,” Senykoff and Magee said in a statement through Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett’s office.

“We hope that the 10-year commemoration of this terrible event will encourage those who have information on this crime to come forward. The time is now and this injustice should not continue. We support the authorities in their investigation, and hope that they will be able to bring this case to a clear conclusion soon,” they stated.

“Jack and Jeri will live forever in our hearts and memories,” they continued. “But the people who committed this act are still at large, and they need to be brought to justice. We ask that anyone who has any knowledge of what happened to Jack and Jeri immediately come forward to the Andover Police Department. Please help us solve this crime.”

Over the past decade law enforcement from the Andover Police Department, Massachusetts State Police and FBI have chased down leads to try and solve the mysterious double homicide, The Eagle-Tribune previously reported.

On the morning of Dec. 14, 2011, John “Jack” Magee, 69, and Geraldine “Jeri” Magee, 67, were both found shot dead in their home at 7 Orchard Crossing. Their bodies were discovered that morning by their daughter, Holly Senykoff, who was dropping off her children at the time.

In the initial police log entry for the incident, a police dispatcher noted “they are lying on the ground with blood coming out, she (the daughter) believes they are beyond any help.” In January 2012, two death certificates from the state’s Medical Examiner’s Office asserted that John died of gunshot wounds to the head, neck and chest, from one or possibly more assailants over a period of seconds. Geraldine was killed by a single shot to the head.

The day before the murders, John went to a construction site in Reading where his company was building several houses. While he was there, he spoke with his son John Magee III about picking up building materials in Boston and bringing them to the site the next day. Jack Magee reportedly left the construction site around 3 p.m.

Senykoff told police that on Dec. 13, she spoke to her mother around 4:25 p.m., regarding plans for the next day. Senykoff said her mother agreed to watch her grandchildren while Senykoff went shopping for Christmas presents. Senykoff also said she believed she could hear her father talking in the background and assumed that he was home with Geraldine.

John Magee III was at the Magee Construction office, in the basement of his parent’s Andover home, researching some information about the supplies he had to pick up in Boston. According to Blodgett, he left his parents’ home around 4:30 p.m., Dec. 13.

“At approximately 9:19 the next morning, Andover police received a 911 call from Holly reporting that she found her parents dead in their home,” Blodgett said during a press conference in 2015. “The investigation began immediately.”

On Dec. 13, 2011, the night before the murders, a black Lexus SUV owned by the Magees was found burning on Prince Street in Boston’s North End.

Police conducted dozens of interviews with family, friends and Magees’ employees in Massachusetts and Jupiter, Florida, where the Magees had a second home.

However, the murder has yet to be solved.

Anyone with any information is encouraged to contact the Massachusetts State Police detectives assigned to the District Attorney’s Office at 978-745-8908 or the Andover Police Anonymous Tip Line at 978-623-3560.

Let's look more into this with a few excerpts from Fox 5 Vegas.

For decades, she was known only as ""Jane Arroyo Grande Doe."" Last week, Henderson police finally identified the teen whose body found 40 years ago on the side of the road, stabbed, beaten and nude. FOX5 spoke with the family who never stopped looking for Tammy Terrell of New Mexico. 

Terrell was one of four sisters who grew up in a foster home. Carla Klontz was the youngest and was 13 years old when her sister went missing.

“The police said she was 17 and had ran away a couple times and she was almost going to be 18, so they are not going to look for her. So, they didn’t,” Klontz said.

She looked everywhere she went for her sister for the next four decades.

“Her birthday is on the Fourth of July. You are wondering and you a missing her. It’s not a true celebration with her missing, and we would always look in crowds, look at homeless people in their faces to see if she is one of them,” Klontz said.

From what I read, she was identified through the DNA samples from her sisters. If you want to read more, I'll include the link to the story.

Law enforcement and the media has provided minimal information.  The father's family has made a few statements that were, I would say, not normal.  A video interview of his family had two women who had the demeanor as if they were deciding where to go for dinner.  No sense of grief, no ""I miss my brother"" talk.....just talk about raising money for the kids (it's up to over $120,000 right now!).  Same thing with the family's FB posts.  Very very generic and business-like.  There hasn't been a peep from the mom's side of the family.  Usually in cases like this the media at least announces who is caring for the kids....in this instance they haven't even said ""the children are with relatives"" statement.  The local media has not done any follow up stories since the initial death notification.  This is concerning because people have dumped over $120,000 into this family via GoFundMe.  All indications are there was some type of illegal, or at least immoral activity, going on and with this and the truth is being withheld.

When it was discovered in 2000 an Antarctic researcher had been poisoned, it was too late - seven months had passed since his death and his colleagues had long left the ice. 

The case came before a coroner's court in New Zealand, which determined that Marks had drunk methanol 'unknowingly' on the winter over stationing at Scott - Amundsen South Pole Base.

Having died long, dark season on the base - it was not until Spring that Marks could be returned to Christchurch for autopsy. Until then Australian scientist's death had been ascribed to 'natural causes'.

Due to the period of time between his death and the poisoning verdict, his international colleagues had left the country. They could not be recalled for questioning.

Only five of the fifty overwinter workers ever responded to questions from the coronial hearing.

It remains unresolved.

**Toast juice?**  
It was discovered that there was a culture of alcohol abuse and possibly other substances on the base.

Researchers had begun distilling hard spirits to drink. The home-made spirits were called 'toast juice', but analysis showed that there was low levels of methanol present. 

None of his colleagues suffered from methanol poisoning.  

**Polar politics**   
The case came to New Zealand's courts almost by accident. The US-operated base and run by contractors Raytheon, were not obliged to respond to the NZ court's requests.   
New Zealand has an historic claim to the area in which the incident took place, however - under the [Antarctic Treaty System](https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/avc/trty/193967.htm) \- the US Antarctic Program and National Science Foundation ""do not recognize the claims of other governments"" to Antarctica. 

It has been suggested that the lack of cooperation came from a lack of desire to acknowledge any other country's jurisdiction over the continent. Neither did New Zealand wish to rock the boat, as a host nation to several international Antarctic programmes - the US included.

There was very little appetite for an enquiry into the 'culture' on the base.

So, with these obstacles in the way, no definitive explanation for Marks' death was ever reached.

On the brisk October afternoon of 1973 , two Lebanon county game deputies were on patrol . They were patrolling the fort Indiantown (Pennsylvania) military game reserve , when they noticed a strange decaying odor driving down moonshine road. Poaching had been huge problem in that area, so they went to investigate.

Upon investigation , they found the decomposing nude remains of a young adult female women. She was covered in thick tree branches and a 48'' by 32.5"" sheet of green plastic. On the sheet there was a white seal that read "" National Sanitation Foundation, Testing Laboratory 8505 "". It was estimated that she had been dead for two week, was of Caucasian decent (white), she was 16 - 20 years old , had light auburn hair , and was around 5'7"" in height.

The cause of death has been determined to be homicidal , even though she had no bullet wounds, no bone fractures , no missing limbs , and was not set on fire . Isotope testing indicated she was from the southern united states . She had no clothes or Jewelry , nor where there any clothes or personal artifacts found near by.

The biggest evidence in this case was the white seal that read ""national sanitation foundation, testing laboratory 8505"". There is no direct laboratory with that name, but the National sanitation foundation does exist.

The national sanitation foundation was founded in 1944 , it was started to provide standards and practices to the food industry. It has since evolved into a international company with laboratories in Europe, south America , and Asia.

When researching this case , I found that there was a place called USGS located at ***8505*** *Research Way*,. *Middleton*, WI 5356 . Its a united states geological society office which is contracted with the National sanitation foundation to test ground water used in food processing.

Her body was fond near the indiantown Gap military base, a army staging area that was founded in 1941. It would train troops on how to preform overseas during WW2, the korean war, and other American backed peace-keeping conflicts. During the 1970's it served as the largest ROTC training camp in the country. Getting soldiers ready for the Vietnam war.

The National sanitation Foundation does have contracts with the US military to provide food sanitation services such as dishwashers and autoclaves. They also take samples of the ground water, that is used at the base. It is not know if there is/was a NSF testing laboratory at the base. The green tarp could have been samples that were about to be shipped out to a laboratory.

&amp;#x200B;

She might have been  a runaway , who got in touch with a solider station there during the Vietnam war. A couple of local runaways have been ruled out and her dna has no been matched to anyone in the DNA Doe database .

142,erobin37,1642112542,"On **July 6, 1981**, Theodore Frederick Kampf (46) left his Oaklyn, NJ residence for a long drive to Vancouver, BC to visit a friend. He was driving his recently purchased 1980 brick-brown Chevrolet pickup truck, mounted with a camper shell. It was the last time he was seen by his parents.

Theodore Kampf, known as Teddy, was the son of Theodore Sr. and Mary Kampf, who had lived in Oaklyn for 20 years. Teddy was an ex-serviceman who worked for several major electronics firms in the years before he went missing. His parents described him as ""a bit of an egghead"" and someone who ""never thought people were bad.""

His family received correspondence from him until **July 11**, five days after he departed. On **July 13**, he called his parents and said he was in Mount Vernon, Washington and going to cross the border into Canada. This was the last time anyone heard from him. At first, his parents were not concerned due to an going Canadian postal strike during the summer. 

Unbeknownst to Teddy's parents at the time, soon after some of Teddy’s traveler’s checks were cashed at a British Columbia bank. The checks had forged signatures, though the bank tellers who cashed the forged travelers' checks did not question the signatures and none could recall the person who presented the checks. A camera used to photograph customers at the bank was broken on the day before the person came in.

On **July 27**, Teddy’s truck was involved in a fender bender in Boise, Idaho. The driver identified himself as Teddy. The other driver, Christine Christenson, seeking insurance information, wrote Kampf's parents to say she'd been involved in a traffic accident with their son. When Teddy's parents phoned her, she provided a physical description of the truck driver - a tall, thin man in his 20s. Teddy was in his 40's and this obviously did not match his description.

In **August**, also unbeknownst to Teddy's parents, more of the traveler’s checks were cashed in North and South Dakota by someone other than Teddy.

In **October**, the family alerted the police. The police then found out about the use of forged checks as mentioned above. The FBI, who did not routinely work on missing persons cases, stepped in when the presence of the forged checks were known. ""We're not worried about the damn checks,"" Teddy's father complained. The Canadian authorities also stepped in, as the checks cashed in BC were indication that Teddy made it to Canada.

On **October 29**, Teddy's truck was found in a Flint Creek Pass, Montana ravine by a group of hunters, three months after Teddy initially disappeared. The Montana authorities only reported it to Oaklyn police on **February 22, 1982**.  By then, the truck had been handled by so many people it was useless as evidence.

Both Christine Christenson and the friend that Teddy was supposed to visit was questioned but there were no notable information presented in the media.

For almost 40 years, this case remained a cold case. Surprisingly, in 2021, his remains were identified. The remains were found on **May 21, 1983** though remained unidentified for quite some time. The body, then nicknamed ""Dawson City John Doe"", was found buried by a woodland brush several meters from the North Fork Dam and Dempster Highway, 40 km east of Dawson City, Yukon. The remains were buried in “an apparent attempt to conceal” the remains. Authorities did not disclose a cause of death. The case of this ""Dawson City John Doe"" was identified as a homicide. 

Authorities in Canada believe Teddy was killed shortly after arriving in Dawson City in July 1981. Investigators believe the person who drove Teddy ’s truck and left it in Montana has a connection to Montana, and possibly to mining. RCMP investigators said the Dawson City area is known for gold deposits and mining in the early 1980s, and the area Teddy’s truck was found is also known for mining. RCMP investigators are looking for information on anyone from Montana or the Granite County area who may have gone to Dawson City, possibly to mine in the Yukon or on the way to Alaska. 

Investigation remains open.

In the spring of 1994, Cleashindra “Clea"" Hall was a bright 18-year-old girl with big plans. The Pine Bluff, Arkansas native was just two weeks away from graduating with honors at Watson Chapel High School. She had a summer internship lined up in Boston, and that fall she would’ve been heading off to Tennessee State University’s pre-med program, pursuing her dream of becoming a pediatrician. But that all changed on the evening of Monday, May 9, when after leaving her workplace at an office in town, Cleashindra Hall disappeared. 


 

That Monday was the family’s first day back to their normal routine following an exciting weekend; Clea’s prom had been that Friday, she attended a sorority ball on Saturday, and celebrated Mother’s Day on Sunday. Cleashindra had an afterschool job doing clerical work at the home office of Dr. Larry Amos, who wrote grants allocating resources for childcare facilities. Once  was done with helping out around his office, she would always call her mom to come pick her up. Only that evening, Cleshindra didn’t call. 

Laurell Hall, Cleashindra’s mother, waited for the house phone to ring that night and when it didn’t, her mother called Dr. Amos’ office. He said that Hall clocked out at 8:30 p.m. and was picked up by an unknown individual. 

“I'm thinking, okay, she's never done this before, but she is a teenager and she’s 18, about to graduate, so maybe she's decided that she's gonna flex her independent muscles,” Laurell said. “But I stayed up all night because I'm looking out the window thinking, ‘you're going to be in trouble, young lady, when you come home’…daylight came and she wasn't at home.” 

At first, Hall's family thought she might have gone straight to school that morning. 

“My middle son, when he got to school, he called home. He probably bugged them all day, that office, but he called home and he said she's not at school.”  

That’s when Laurell reported her daughter missing to police. Thus began an enduring search which has lasted to this day. Cleashindra family hung up flyers around town and contacted the news, while police eventually searched the area including Dr. Amos’ office, but found no clues that could point to the whereabouts of Cleashindra Hall. 

“We’re still searching. It’s been 26 years, and 26 years is a long time not to know anything,” said Laurell. If we could just get one tip, one clue, we might be able to break the case open.”


Although Cleashindra was 18 when she vanished, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children is still involved with her case due to a provision of the PROTECT Act of 2003 known as “Suzanne’s Law.” Named after missing 19-year-old college student Suzanne Lyall from Albany, NY in 1998, this law extends to missing young adults 18-20 the same reporting and law enforcement response requirements already provided for children younger than 18. Thanks to Suzanne’s Law, NCMEC is able to use our resources like poster creation, media distribution, family advocacy services, and age progression technology to aid in missing young adult cases. 

Each year on Cleashindra’s birthday: March 30, her missing date: May 9, and Labor Day, Cleashindra’s friends and family release pink balloons to keep her case in the public’s eye, and to let everyone know that they’re still searching. 


“She was somebody that had a light that meant something. She had goals and she had dreams just like everybody else. And our family had dreams and goals for her, too. And so somewhere we're missing out on seeing what our life could have been.”

Hello everyone.

I have been reading a few unsolved cases lately where I realized that the possibility a person was possibily LGBTQ was not even considered and could help the investigation if it had been.

For example,

One of the victims of the Long Island Serial Killer keeps being referred to as ""an asian male"". The forensic portrait clearly makes the victim look like a generic cishet asian man. But the fact is that most of the killer's victims were women, a large portion of them sex workers. So how come investigators never stopped to consider the victim was possibly a trans woman who was assigned male at birth? And also happened to be a sex worker, which is unfortunately work that a lot of trans women turn to when they struggle.

Also, many cases where someone never really had a girlfriend, lived in a strict religious family environment, was acting distant before their disappearance and seem to have planned some sort of getaway and the family is like ""no, I know my child"" despite the fact that most parents don't really know their adult children that well.

Do you have any cases that come to mind in that sense?

This is probably one of the most infamous killings that happened in France. The investigation has an international reach, including countries like Iraq, Sweden and the UK. To this day, we still have no idea for what reason these people had to die and are no closer to finding the killer.  
Most people that know about this mystery on this sub are probably familiar with the [GQ article](https://www.gq.com/story/alps-murder-chevaline) that tells the events of the investigation.

## The discovery  
On September 5th 2012, [William Brett Martin](https://www.faitsdivers.org/brettmartin2.jpg), a retired member of the Royal Air Force, was biking on chemin de la Combe d'Ire (a forest road) in [Chevaline](https://www.map-france.com/town-map/74/74072/small-administrative-france-map-Chevaline.jpg), close to Annecy (east of France, or south-east if you’re from Paris) (note that it is close to Swiss, being in the French Alps). During his ride, he was passed at 3:15 PM by another cyclist (later revealed to be Sylvain Mollier), a “green or dark-colored” 4x4 car, and a few minutes later a motorbike.  
A while later, in a parking lot situated at the end of the road, he finds a little girl that appears hurt falling on the ground. He can see a cyclist laying on the ground and a [BMW 5 Series estate car](https://i2-prod.getsurrey.co.uk/incoming/article5841851.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/french-alps-shooting-gallery-11.jpg)(English car, steering wheel on the right side) wheels still turning. Approaching the car, he notices a few holes on the driver side and a “hot burning engine smell”. He breaks the window and turns off the engine. Looking inside the car, he can see people with “heads with bullet holes in them”. He secured the little girl and moved the cyclist's body from under the car and went to get help, his mobile phone having no signal.  
Going down the road, he crosses a car at 3:44 PM, telling them to call for help, which arrives at 4:03 PM. At around 6 PM, multiple cops and a helicopter are dispatched to secure the area.  
Around 11 PM, another vacationer, spending the holidays at the same camping site, notifies the authorities of the existence of another little girl. She is then found safe around midnight, hidden under her mother’s legs(rear seats) for about 8 hours. She wasn’t found earlier because the policemen were waiting for the forensics.

[The family](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02827/hillisUSE_2827089b.jpg) is from the U.K., of Iraqi origin and has 5 members. [Saad](https://i2-prod.getsurrey.co.uk/incoming/article5841687.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/saad-al-hilli.jpg), the father (50), [Iqbal](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2019545.main_image.jpg), the mother (47) a Swedish dentist from Iraq, their two daughters Zainab(7) &amp; Zeena(4)(both of whom are still alive), and Suhaila al-Hallaf, the mother of Iqbal (74).  
On the 29th of August, they left Great Britain on the 10 PM ferry, for a trip to France (Haute-Savoie) with a planned return on the 7th of September.  
They first reached the “Village Camping Europa” camping site in Saint-Jorioz, on the western shore of Lake Annecy. This is the third time they came here on holidays. They booked the space for one week but left after only two days. They moved their caravan 2.6 km(1.6 mile) from there to another camping site: “Le solitaire du Lac”.  
According to a camper, Saad was seen having a very heated discussion with a visitor wearing a suit. However, different versions of the event exist where the discussion happened on either camping site.  
Each victim was shot twice in the head, and the father was shot 5 times overall. The eldest daughter was hit by the aggressor with the butt of his weapon that resulted in a skull fracture, and shot in the shoulder.  
* Sylvain Mollier  
The cyclist, [Sylvain Mollier](https://www.ulyces.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ulyces-chevalinemeurtreep1-08.jpg), father of 3, was a 45 years old local. He was employed in the Ugine factory of the Cezus company, a member of the [Areva nuclear group](https://www.sa.areva.com/). On a ride during his paternity leave, he was shot seven times.
 
 
## The police investigation  
[**Map of the area**](https://i.imgur.com/jRy6EBj.png)  
[**Crime scene (NSFW)**](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/image/_W63AXgAn-4VBjPZypMldAnVEYU/600x400/regions/2020/06/08/5ede8daad953d_chevaline_vue_aerienne_de_la_scene_de_crime_1.jpg) [Additional](https://images.sudouest.fr/2012/10/29/57ecc94b66a4bdfb7ce38a0f/widescreen/1000x500/le-5-septembre-saad.jpg) [angles](https://i.f1g.fr/media/cms/704x396_crop/2020/09/03/c76880389a5285f4bd23810cbf5ecf7e2d75865f23876ba9926e79414fccd0d3.jpeg)  
The Combre d’Ire road is accessible by car for 12.7 km (7.9 miles) and ends in a small parking lot (called Martinet) but continues with a small dirt road only accessible by foot. It is a common spot used by hikers that leads to Jarsy (small city).  
Searching Saad’s past, it appears his dad fled Iraq after his brother was tortured with his wife and his two sons (Zaid and Saad) to move to London. The family owned a home valued at more than 1 million pounds. Their father died in 2011 and the cause of his death isn’t clear.  
Saad’s brother Zaid worked in accounting. In 2001, Saad founded his own engineering company with his brother as secretary until he was replaced by his wife in February 2011. He worked on contracts including some work on the inside of the A380 and on SSTL since 2010.  
Saad’s wife Iqbal is a Swedish dentist. They apparently met in Dubai in 2003. From February 1999 and January 2001, Iqbal lived is the US where she met, married and divorce [James Dudley Thompson](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/11n05dudley-488127.jpg). He died from cardiac arrest September 5th 2012 at 5 PM (local time), meaning he died only 7 hours after his ex-wife. Saad apparently wasn’t aware of this first marriage. It was however believed that he could have been poisoned. Authorities have asked if they could exhume his body, but the family refused to comply. 
As soon as the French detectives started working on the case, they asked for a joint investigation with the British police to be able to bring it on English soil, to search their home and question relatives. After much investigation, the passports were impossible to be found.  
On November 4th 2013, an [Identikit picture](https://images.ladepeche.fr/api/v1/images/view/5c2e16d03e454640eb6934bd/full/image.jpg) was shared of the biker, wearing a GPA type ISR helmet.  
The girls were questioned but the youngest saw nothing, being hidden and the oldest barely spoke, only mentioning that there was only one “bad guy”.  
Ballistic analysis showed the all the victims were shot with 7.65 caliber ammunition from the same weapon, a [Luger P06 Parabellum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Luger-M1900.jpg), which was a weapon issued for the Swiss army at the start of the 20th century. This kind of weapon is most likely owned by local families and collectors. At least 21 shots were fired (although some sources say around 25) and the magazine can only hold 8 bullets, meaning the shooter had to reload at least twice.  
Looking for the 4x4 car, a witness gave a detailed description of the BMW that he saw on the road leading to the parking lot. A very important piece of information he gave was that he saw the steering wheel on the right side, indicating that it was probably an English car.  
During the investigations, two different DNA profiles were taken from inside the car. But it was soon revealed that the crime scene had been contaminated.
 
 
## How the shooting (probably) happened  
Saad parks his car in the parking spot, and goes out with his daughter.  
A shooter coming from the road after the parking lot starts shooting, hitting the father, the French cyclist and one person seated on the rear seats (because of the position of the bullet casings and the broken glass).  
Saad gets into his car, gets into reverse and tries to get away from the shooter. It is believed that he left his daughter outside, explaining why she could get away from the area. Saad does a reverse maneuver with his car (indicated by the tire marks) but drags the body of the cyclist alongside his car. The car gets stuck on the dirt pile delimiting the parking lot.  
The shooter gets closer to the stuck car and starts shooting at the people inside the car (another window broken and more bullet casing on a different spot).  
The shooter gets to the little girl and hits her (most likely with the butt of his weapon) on the head (possibly because he was out of ammo) before leaving the scene.  
The British cyclist arrives at the crime scene, secures the other cyclist’s body, the car and the little, and then goes looking for another car to call the police.

## Dead leads
* A policeman and weapon collector, matching the profile of the biker, was questioned but was soon released, not matching any of the DNA samples taken.
* By analyzing more than 4000 mobile phones, the biker was found. He appeared to be an honest businessman that was doing some paragliding and was coming back home, according to the detectives.  
* In June 2014, a former legionnaire, acquaintance of the murdered cyclist, ended his life, saying in a suicide letter that he couldn’t bear the accusations and the suspicions. He was later cleared from the investigation.  
* Working on new technologies, it could have been possible Saad was killed because of industrial espionage.  
* Haydar Thaher, brother of Iqbal and son of Suhaila al-Hallaf had a history of violence against his parents and was missing from the family home in Stockholm. He was later found hospitalized in England since a few weeks ago, having an alibi for this day.  
* The idea of grand theft auto that turned wrong was put forward, because of previous incidents of the same nature that happened around the same area lately. In November 2013 a similar case happened close to Chevaline where two burglars shot the woman and beat up the man who owned the place.  
* A South African weapon collector was arrested in 2017 in the general area but was soon freed from any suspicion because the only relation was the area and the weapons.  
* A local criminal named Nordahl Lelandais, who was judged guilty of killing an eight-year-old in September 2017 and a 24 years-old soldier in April of the same year, was investigated for this shooting. He was later ruled out, justified partly by the fact that the shooter was very accurate with his gun, something that Lelandais didn’t have the training for, being a dog trainer for the army.  
 
 
## Possible leads  
* The brother of Saad was investigated, their father died recently and apparently possessed a heritage of multiple millions of pounds, including houses in England, France, Swiss and Spain. Multiple witnesses reported that Saad was preoccupied during the last months by a problem of unknown nature. BBC Panorama also found that Zaid had forged documents to withdraw 2 million pounds from his late father's estate.  
* Police also believed Saad could have been targeted over a contract for Airbus, and have investigated whether his murder was a result of contract killing. Supposedly, a 35 year-old Iraqi was hired for a hit on some Iraqi. Shortly before his death, he apparently visited a bank in Geneva. It was believed that Saad could have had access to Saddam Hussein’s missing fortune but was soon denied by intelligence agencies saying the two weren’t linked whatsoever.
* It had been suggested that Sylvain Mollier, the cyclist, was the target instead of the Al-Hilli family. Since he was a welder in a stainless steel factory that was contracted by a nuclear energy company, he could have been targeted for what he could have known. It was later revealed that he had never been exposed to any nuclear secret.  
 
 
## A new turn of events?  
Earlier last year (February 2021), Marie-Hélène Dini, a sports coach, was almost shot by a hit squad that was hired by one of her rivals. Jean-Luc B., a business coach and Freemason was allegedly the one who spent more than $60K for the hit. The men that attempted to kill Ms Dini were arrested and ammunition (apparently rare but 9x19 is very common, we lack a lot of details) that could fit the Luger P06 were found at the home of one of them, although the hitmen were using a different kind of weapon on this day.  
Quite recently (September 30th, 2021), the location of the murders was blocked off by police. They were trying to time the different versions of the shootings to rule out discrepancy. They also did a 3D reconstruction of the crime scene. We can assume the investigation is still ongoing.
 
 
## Still unanswered questions  
* Was it really a hit when the weapon used was a WWII relic and the ammunition for it is hard to find? Should it be a local then or was the weapon acquired locally from what was available? The accuracy indicates a professional hit, but the weapon says otherwise.  
* Who was the target of the attack? The father of the family or the cyclist? It’s likely the cyclist was just at the wrong place at the wrong time, but it’s hard to find a reason for the murder of the father. Was there even a target, and wasn’t this the result of an attack by a psychopath? 
* Why was the little girl spared? Did he run out of bullets and tried to get away fast, or did a quadruple murderer suddenly have morals?  
* Who was the man Saad had a heated discussion with? Where and when did it actually happen? Is this why they changed camps? What was the subject of their discussion?  
* Can the recent developments finally bring an answer to this mystery? But if it was a hit squad, who hired them? The brother? The man who the father had a heated discussion with?

[Stuart Isaac](https://uncovered.com/cases/stuart-isaac) a native of the Republic of Palau, was living in Burtonsville, Maryland with his family in 2010. A stocky man at 5’8” and 215 lbs, Stuart Issac was not usually an outdoorsman, but on September 6, Stuart decided to pack a bag, write a note to his family and leave for a roadtrip to Yellowstone National Park in his 2009, black Lexus Sedan—with no prior experience with hiking or camping. On September 7, 2010, 32 hours after he left his home in Burtonsville, Maryland, Stuart arrived at Yellowstone National Park.Then, 2 weeks later, he phoned an old friend from high school,on September 24th. Since Matsue lives in Guam, typically the two communicate via email or text. The call was unexpected because of the time change—it was 3:30am EST for Stuart. [The call lasted for at least two hours](https://missingnpf.com/listing/stuart-isaac/).Two days later on September 26, Stuart parked his 2009 black Lexus IS-250 sedan with a license plate that read BELLEK at Craig Pass, which[ is approximately eight miles east of Old Faithful Geyser  Yellowstone National Grand Loop Road in Wyoming](https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/stuart-isaac). 

Stuart was discovered missing during a routine night patrol in the Craig Pass area later that night. An officer had discovered Stuart’s abandoned unlocked car with his keys still inside but no other trace of Stuart. [Craig Pass is known to have an approximate elevation of 8,362 feet and has a mountain pass located near Continental Drive.](https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/stuart-isaac) There were no hiking trails in this area. A land and air search began immediately but no sign of Stuart. 

**A timeline of events for Stuart’s disappearance** 

* **September 6, 2010:** Stuart left a note for his family telling them he would be going on a cross-country road trip. The note does not mention when he plans on returning.
* **September 7, 2010** | Stuart arrives at Yellowstone National Park. The drive is roughly 32 hours from his home in Burtonsville, Maryland. 
* **September 24, 2010** | Stuart’s whereabouts are unaccounted for until September 24th when Stuart has a two-hour-long phone call with his friend from high school, Matsue Evens. Typically Matsue and Stuart communicated through text or email, therefore it was odd that he was calling. She lives in Guam, when Stuart called her it was 6:30 PM for her and 3:30 AM EST for him.
* **September 26, 2010** | Stuart parks his black 2009 Lexus IS-250 Sedan at Craig Pass. This area has no hiking trail. [His vanity license plate read BELLEK”. The car was unlocked and the keys were left inside. About eight miles East of Yellowstone National Park Grand Loop Road](https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/stuart-isaac).
* **September 26, 2010** | Later that day, Stuart's abandoned car is discovered by a routine patrol check. Stuart is nowhere to be found. A land and air search begins immediately for Stuart. 

It is still a mystery as to why Stuart went to Yellowstone so abruptly. And to this day he is still missing. Where was he between the time when he arrived at the park and when he called his friend weeks later? Were you in the Yellowstone National Park area on September 24, 2010 and remember seeing a 2009 black Lexus IS-250 Sedan?

While the data is limited, it is estimated that[ approximately 29 unresolved missing people cases date back to the 1950s](https://www.insider.com/several-people-have-gone-missing-national-parks-across-country-2021-9).

150,thenorius_enricheto,1642085985,"Joshua Guimond, a third-year student at St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, attended a party with some of his friends on Saturday night, November 9, 2002. It was a small gathering of less than 10 people, and was held in a Metten Court dormitory.  Josh left the room just before midnight, and friends of his assumed he was heading down the hall to use the bathroom.  When he didn't come back after 15 minutes, they wondered if he'd decided to go back to his apartment on campus.  They tried to call him there;  when they got no answer, they thought he was already asleep.  Josh wasn't sleeping though, and he never came back to his apartment.  He was never seen again.

Josh grew up in Maple Lake, Minnesota.  He majored in political science at St. John's and was a popular student with many friends.  St. John's was a rather small school, with about 1850 students.  Located 120 kilometers northwest of Minneapolis, it provided a peaceful and quiet learning environment.  Surrounded by acres of woods and several lakes, students used to joke that they were separated from the rest of society by a pine curtain.  They saw their campus as a utopian place and rarely thought about security.

Josh planned a future in politics after graduation.  He was the treasurer of the Pre-Law Society and co-captain of the university's mock trial team.  A student of excellence, he was considered responsible, logical and very organized.  He taught other students and loved to spend hours debating political and legal issues.  His grandmother had served two terms in the Minnesota House of Representatives, and Josh wanted to follow in her footsteps.  He even used “Senator Josh” as his email name.

THE DISAPPEARENCE

Josh spent the afternoon before the party working on an article he was writing about Alexander Hamilton.  He then relaxed with some friends in his apartment for a few hours, drinking beer and talking about the future.  Around 11 pm, the group decided to meet up with some other friends, so they left Josh's apartment at St. Maur House and walked the short distance across campus to Metten Court.  There, they continued drinking beer and playing cards.  Friends saw Josh leave the room about 30 minutes after he arrived and assumed he was just leaving to use the bathroom.  No one has reported seeing Josh leaving Metten Court, and no one remembers seeing him walking back to his apartment.  His movements after he left his friend's room are completely unknown.

Josh was scheduled to be at a mock trial meeting the following afternoon at 2:30 pm.  When he didn't show up, several of his companions tried to reach him in his apartment, but got no response.  It wasn't like Josh to miss a meeting, so friends of his were immediately afraid that something was wrong.  After comparing notes, they realized that no one had seen Josh since the night before.  His car was still parked in the designated spot, and nothing seemed to be missing from his apartment.  Concerned, they alerted campus police who believed Josh was missing.

 Campus police were not initially worried.  While it wasn't like Josh to disappear, he was a 20-year-old college student.  They assumed he simply met up with some other friends and went out for the night.  They did a quick search of the campus that night, but found nothing to indicate where Josh might have gone.

Josh's friends and classmates expected him to show up the next day with a good story about where he'd been.  When he missed classes on Monday morning, they knew something was wrong.  They called the Stearns County Sheriff's Department and reported Josh missing.  Deputies conducted a massive search for Josh that day, combing all 2,400 acres of the St. John's campus, as well as 700 adjacent acres of forest.

Search dogs were brought in to see if they could track where Josh might have gone when he left Metten Court.  To get back to his apartment at St. Maur House, Josh would have to cross Lake Stumpf using one of the two bridges.  After tracker dogs appeared to smell him near a culvert on the east end of Lake Stumpf, officers feared Josh might have fallen into the lake.  Although the waters were relatively calm, the water temperature was only a few degrees above zero.  If Josh had fallen, he wouldn't have been able to survive for long.  An extensive search of the lake failed to produce any evidence that Josh was in the water, but police would continue to monitor the area.

A Minnesota State Patrol helicopter flew over the campus using infrared radar but found nothing relevant to the search.  Delegates on horseback scoured the wooded areas around the campus, and volunteers helped search the campus.  Police contacted all the hunters who participated in a controlled deer hunt near the campus on Sunday afternoon, but none of them saw anything unusual in the woods.

 Josh's parents arrived at the university on Monday afternoon and made tearful pleas for information about what had happened to their son.  Brian Guimond would spend the next few nights sleeping in his son's apartment, talking to the students about Josh and gathering ideas for possible search areas.  He attended several press conferences and made a strong appeal to area residents to check their properties for clues to Josh's whereabouts.  He was convinced that Josh had been kidnapped.

The police found nothing to indicate that any crime had taken place and they believed that Josh had likely fallen into the lake and drowned.  They pointed out that Josh had been drinking before his disappearance and may have tripped in the water and gotten too drunk to go out.  His friends, however, noticed that Josh didn't seem to be at all harmed that night.  Although they admitted he had consumed about ten beers, he did so over the course of six hours and appeared to be perfectly sober during the walk to Metten Court less than an hour before disappearing.

Over the course of three days, an area of ​​20 square miles was thoroughly searched several times, but nothing was found.  The police became increasingly convinced that Josh would be found at one of the lakes on campus.  They worked with university officials to lower the water level in Lake Stumpf;  although the lake was very shallow, the water was very murky.  Divers were sent several times without success, so the lake was washed away as the water level dropped.  Once again, nothing was found to indicate that Josh was at Lake Stumpf.  The divers were sent out again a week later, this time with side-scan sonar equipment that gave them a detailed view of the lake floor.  They didn't find any evidence of Josh.

 Detectives interviewed Josh's family, friends and classmates, but found nothing to indicate that he had planned his own disappearance.  He was known on campus for being responsible and sensible, and he was doing well in every class.  A computer search of him turned up nothing;  His research history was free of anything incriminating and he preferred humor sites and political discussion groups.  They found several articles he'd downloaded the afternoon before he disappeared, and they all belonged to his research work on Alexander Hamilton.

Although Josh's parents continued to believe that he had been kidnapped from campus, the police still leaned towards the theory that he had fallen into a lake and drowned.  They noted that if he had ended up in the water, the weather would have played a role in his efforts to get his body back.  If the air temperature remained consistent, they believed it could float to the surface in a day or two.  If temperatures start to drop, however, ice will begin to form on the lake's surface and his body may remain trapped under the water until the spring thaw.

In April, the search for Josh was renewed.  His father took time off work and spent hours kayaking on campus lakes, praying for answers.  He still thought Josh had been kidnapped, but he was keeping an open mind and knew there was a possibility the lake would finally reveal its secrets.  He carefully monitored the water temperature every day, but even the hottest water produced no evidence of his son.

 In May, the Trident Foundation arrived on campus to do its own research on the lakes.  Known as the nation's leading authority on water search and rescue, they were confident they would be able to find Josh if he was actually in the water.  They spent days sending divers to the lakes, using specialized equipment to aid in their search.  One by one, they cleaned up every body of water on the campus and determined that Josh wasn't there.  The executive director told police that his recommendation was to take the search in a different direction;  Josh hadn't fallen into one of the lakes.

 For Josh's parents, the Trident search simply confirmed what they already knew: Josh wasn't on campus.  Something must have happened to him that night that made it impossible for him to come home.  The detectives were lost.  They'd interviewed everyone on campus the night Josh disappeared, and no one had seen or heard anything unusual.  They were confident that Josh hadn't staged his own disappearance, and now the idea that he'd drowned in one of the lakes seemed impossible either.  They were willing to consider the possibility of foul play, but they had no evidence pointing in either direction.  The investigation stopped.

DETAILS

One month before Josh went missing, St. John’s was in the headlines. The college announced a major settlement of a dozen cases of abuse by monks at the Abbey on campus. Josh’s father would also learn that monks, who were credibly accused of past abuse, supervised both his son’s dorm and the one where he was last seen.
He never knew of the school’s history before.

Brian’s persistent questions and trips to campus were met with a restraining order by St. John’s. The college denied WCCO’s request for an interview. But, in a statement said there is “no evidence linking the abbey” to Josh’s disappearance and including the monks in our report is “journalism by … rumor.”
WCCO asked the Stearns County Sheriff’s Office if it thinks St. John’s had something to do with his disappearance.
“We have no hard evidence that leads us to believe or not to believe that anyone is involved or not involved in the reason Joshua is missing or what happened to Joshua,” Sorenson said.
Guimond’s roommate admits whatever may happened to his friend soured his relationship with his alma mater.
“Had there been some kind of accident like you hear about or still do hear about with college students he would have been found by now,” Hydukovich said. “It’s always tough this time of year.”

Brian Guimond suspects that Josh's disappearance could be related to St. John's Abbey, which has been home to a number of monks accused of sexually abusing children. He thinks his son might have been ""set up and grabbed"" and said the Sheriff's Office has been reluctant to look in that direction. ""Well, there was no investigation,"" Guimond said. Officials said he fell into a bog or lake and ""pretty much that was the end of the story as far as the Sheriff's Department is concerned.""

The scent of Chris Jenkins, a missing University of Minnesota student, was traced to St. Johns by Hoover, a man-trailing bloodhound hired by the Jenkins family. Hoover traced the scent to St. Johns Abbey and the dog showed interest of entering. From the apartment where Joshua was last seen, Hoover followed his scent to Stumpf Lake, on to Joshua’s apartment and then on to the Abbey.

Hoover appeared to pick up Joshua’s scent in the back of the Abbey after gaining permission to enter and then to the lake behind the Abbey.

Hoover was brought out again and followed Joshua’s scent to Sagatagan Lake and out onto the lake. Hoover had traced the scent to the center of the lake when St Johns Life Safety staff member asked the group to leave for interfering with the investigation conducted by the Stearns County Sheriffs Dept. and because pets were not allowed on campus. A later clarification by Michael Hemmesch, Director of Communications at St. Johns, stated that both reasons were true but the crew was actually asked to leave because the search was not coordinated through the Stearns County Sheriffs Dept. and their search would impede on the investigation.

The body of Chris Jenkins, the missing U of M student, was found in the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis,in February 27th,2003.The Jenkins and Guimond families had been working together to find their sons after both were reported missing within the same two-week period.

St Johns University Via The Order Of St Benedict take out court Order of restraint against Joshua Guimond’s father to stop him from further searching for his son at St Johns University and St Johns Abbey and they win.

In the hours after Guimond disappeared, and on subsequent days, someone erased items from his computer hard drive. It isn't clear who did this or whether the erasure is connected to his disappearance. Some of the information that was erased, and later recovered, was about making fake identification cards.

At around the time Guimond, disappeared, three other college-aged people disappeared from the Minnesota and Wisconsin areas. They were all Minnesota residents, and all of them vanished on weekend nights after having visited bars or parties.

The bodies of two of them were subsequently found in local bodies of water. The third, Erika Dalquist, was the victim of a homicide. Her remains were found on May 15, 2004 on property owned by the grandparents of William Gene Myears, a long-time suspect in her case, and he was charged with second-degree murder.

None of the missing young adults knew each other. However, it was suggested that the four cases might linked, as it is statistically improbable that four people of similar age would randomly vanish from the same area at around the same time. In addition, all three of the men who disappeared were college students with similar heights and builds, and were described as high achievers.

Police investigated and, citing ""glaring differences"" in the four cases, stated there was no connection.

Guimond's loved ones say it is uncharacteristic of him to leave without warning. They believe foul play may have been involved in his disappearance.

For some reason I feel this is trickier than it actually is to explain. I've been really interested in the last week in the case of **Brianna Maitland**, and among the most interesting tidbits about the case is suspected CCTV sighting of her in Atlantic City, two years after he disappearance. The whole case is eerie and upon a google search I found stills of the video, and a kind of chill came over me. Without context it's a normal still, but even if it's not her, it's still for some reason unsettling to see an unidentified woman attached to the case. Granted, from my deep dive, I'm pretty certain Brianna died shortly after her disappearance. 

Another one is **Amy Lynn Bradley**, who disappeared on a cruise ship in 1998, anyone who's followed the case is probably familiar with photos suspected to be her, post cruise involved in some sort of human trafficking operation.  

**EXTRA:** While no footage or stills are available, there is confirmed footage of a woman appearing to be **Dr. Sneha Phillip** in her apartment lobby, moments before the 9/11 attack, she was last seen on surveillance in a department store the night before. 

Sighting photos below, what do you guys think, do you suspect either to be Amy or Brianna? Personally I think it's likely the photo of Amy could have been her though I believe if it was, she still deceased in the years past, the woman in the Casino however, I don't believe to be Brianna, simply cause of the probability of her death in the case. What are some other cases, with inconclusive photographic or video sightings?

153,-kelsie,1642062766,"# Where is Kara Nancy Nichols?

*by -kelsie*

  
***^(\*\*I do not give permission for my work to be used elsewhere on the internet\*\*)***

*Kara Nichols was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado*, with blonde hair and deep dark brown eyes on May 20th, 1993, the daughter of Julia and Paul Nichols. They were proud to have a beautiful baby like Kara. Her parents adored her. She had an older brother, and a baby sister came along soon after she was born. The family was close and spent a lot of time together. Things appeared picture perfect, and basically were, for quite some time.

All of this changed around the time Kara was 15. She loved the family's pet dog more than anyone or anything in this world and they were best friends. Her dog passed away. This changed her life considerably. The grief seemed overwhelming for Kara, she could not believe how much it hurt to lose her best animal friend. She fell into the a deep depression, and her parents could not pull their teenage daughter out of her misery. 

Julia and Paul made appointments for her with a therapist and a psychiatrist, but Kara resisted the diagnoses she received and didn’t take her prescribed medication. It is said her diagnoses may have included bipolar disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. She fell in with some new friends at school who impressed her by doing 'dangerous' things she hadn't tried yet. It's been said they were a grade or so ahead of her, so she probably felt cool being with them and looked up to her new friends.

Even though Kara did not want to take the prescribed medications because they made her feel weird, her new friends offered her drugs and Kara decided to give it a chance since her friends like it. For a short time after taking the drugs, she would feel alive and as if the sadness had been lifted. She knew drugs were considered to be bad, but this was the first time she had felt happiness since her dog died... why would she want to stop? She worked on keeping her secret from her parents, but Julia and Paul caught on quickly to what was happening.

When Kara started using, she became rebellious and manic and immediately began cycling  between mania and depression. This fast rollercoaster can be very dangerous for an unmedicated bipolar individual, and they may not be able to stop themselves from making impulsive or irrational decisions. Kara's cycling between mania and depressive episodes could have been an aspect of her disappearance, however; it is unknown.

Kara needed a high school that allowed her to work at her own pace, so she decided to attend a local alternative high school, Life Skills of Colorado Springs. She graduated, and her family was very proud of her as she had hopes, dreams, and goals for the future. Her family could breathe again.

After graduation, Kara had 2 jobs: modeling part time and waitressing at a local restaurant. Her modeling portfolio consisted mostly of lingerie shoots, partially because they paid more than clothed shoots. She also created a profile on Model Mayhem, an online modeling site that links models and photographers judging by distance, style wanted, and experience wanted.

In the summer of 2012, Kara quit her jobs and moved with her family to Chicago, Illinois. When Kara fell even deeper into the rabbit hole of addiction, her family tried to lift her up and help her out by enrolling her in a drug treatment program. Unfortunately, she was discharged earlier for not following the rules of the program.

That August, after being kicked out of drug treatment, Kara moved back to Colorado Springs on her own. She had missed her friends there and the atmosphere in general. She lived in a home with three male roommates somewhere along Mission Road in the Cimarron Hills area of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her big brother lived nearby which soothed some of the worries of their mom and dad.

On the evening of October 9, 2012, Kara left the home she shared with 3 male roommates after informing them she was heading out to Denver for a modeling shoot. As Kara walked out the door, a dark sedan was seen, and the roommate assumed it was her ride.

Over the next two days, Kara’s brother, who lived nearby, attempted to call and send text messages to her, but she never picked up her phone. Kara Nancy Nichols never returned home and has not been heard from since. He reported her missing to the El Paso County Sheriff's office three days later on October 12, after a search by family and friends led nowhere.

When authorities searched the room, they discovered Kara left behind items she would need if she planned to sing belongings: her purse, identification, clothes, makeup, laptop, and $300.

Her phone records, bank account, and social media have shown no activity since she vanished.  
The last activity on her phone were text messages sent on the night of her disappearance at 11:45 pm. Her cell phone, which has not been found, last pinged to cellular towers north of her home in the direction of Denver.

The investigation into Kara having disappeared floundered initially due to the harsh criticisms of policemen and detectives on the team. As is so often the case regarding young people struggling with substance use, Kara was being looked at and treated as if she was sub-human for living her life the way she did. It is despicable, and all missing people deserve to be cared for and found. A recording capturing the view of one police officer on the case was leaked in May of 2014 by EPCSD, and it shocked Kara's family and the community. *Here is part of an article from Gazette dot com about what happened when Deputy Porter was confronted by Undersheriff Presley and Sheriff Maketa:*

&gt;In the 50-minute recording, a man identified as patrol deputy Cliff Porter is confronted in by Undersheriff Paula Presley, Law Enforcement Bureau Chief Al Harmon and Sheriff Terry Maketa about statements he made in the Nichols case.  
Porter was taken off the case after a couple of months, but he came under fire after statements he made to his replacement were reported to his superiors. He repeated those statements in meeting apparently recorded in March.  
**""I said you know ... maybe somebody would finally just say, look, this is a cold case, this girl is probably dead, we're going to work the leads but we're going to shelve this thing, and we won't overreact every time Mr. Nichols comes in,"" the man says in the recording.**  
The recording was released in a response to a complaint Porter filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday, alleging that Maketa tried to bully him into supporting John Anderson in a bid for sheriff.  
On Thursday, Julia and Paul Nichols released a statement in response to the recording and Porter's lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**""The fact that Deputy Porter has the gall to use our daughter's case as a way to cover his own ineptitude is infuriating,"" their statement read.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**Julia Nichols said the recording indicates that Porter mishandled the case - something they believed all along.**  
""In the first few weeks, we were wondering why he wouldn't respond to our calls, and when he did, he seemed very cynical, very negative about the possibility of finding our daughter alive,"" Julia Nichols said Thursday. She said the family's requests to meet Porter were dealt with reluctantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
A new detective was assigned to the case in February 2013, she said. But she believes the case has gone cold, and criticizes the Sheriff's Office for being ineffective.  
**""You just wonder what else has gone on. You wonder how many other victims have been treated like this,"" Nichols said. ""It just re-victimized a family who's already suffering.""**

Once the authorities who (actually) investigated her case realized the sort of path Kara was headed down, they immediately believed foul play was involved. Kara did work with a pimp, and knowing all of these details broke her family's heart. 

They had tried everything they could to get her to change: private mental health facilities, detoxes, rehabs. Kara's parents appeared to be ready to do anything to save their daughter. Unfortunately, drugs had a massive hold on Kara by the time she disappeared, and her parents' wishes did not come true.

It is heartbreaking that Kara's parents struggle with a lot of guilt, and berate themselves with questions such as, ""What if we convinced her to go to this place? What if she would've liked California rehab more and would've agreed to go?"".

Shortly before her disappearance, she allegedly had a falling out with her pimp. Lots of people hold this theory as the truth of what happened to Kara. However, on November 20th, 2012, the police announced they were searching for two brunette women - one with a half-sleeve tat on her arm - who reportedly had spent much of the day with Kara before she went missing.

*Neither woman has been identified*, at the time of this writing.

On November 30, 2012, a profile featuring her photos popped up on MyRedBook, an online Las Vegas escort site. When police called the number on the ad, her family was devastated to report that the voice on the other end was *not* their daughter's.

Authorities discovered that escort websites often use random pictures lifted from the Internet to advertise online. They dismissed the profile.

Foul play is strongly suspected in Kara Nancy Nichols’s disappearance. Authorities pointed to a strong possibility that she may have been targeted by a new sort of organized group that seemed to become a noticeable issue in America in the 2000s - groups specially created for the exploitation and basically, slavery of models. They would oftentimes harm models they promised a photoshoot as well as payment to.

These men would get the young model hooked on drugs so they're easier to control, pimp them out, sell them to other men or organized groups, and generally make their lives a living hell... and that's just if someone survives the initial kidnapping. Where do the two women come involved? Many believe the two women were sent by one of these groups as a way to ease Kara into attending her 'photo shoot' in Denver.

Mary Margaret Click was 21 years old when she went missing from Thunder Bay, Ontario in July 1978. Mary an American citizen who went missing in Canada. Mary was from Madison, Wisconsin and was planning to hitchhike to Banff, Alberta when she disappeared.  Mary's family last heard from her when she called them from Isle Royale, Michigan on July 1, 1978.  

Mary crossed the US/ Canada border at the Pigeon River Border Crossing, which is between Northern Minnesota and Northwestern Ontario.  On July 1, 1978, Mary's belongings were found on a dirt road off Riverside Drive in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Witnesses reported seeing someone matching Mary's description walking along Riverside Drive. 

She has never been heard from again. 

On August 1, 1978, more of Mary's belongings were discovered in Raith, Ontario (which is about 92 km  Northwest of Thunder Bay, along Highway 17). 

There are very few details available on Mary's case, unfortaunely. What is interesting to me, is that apparently Mary called her family from Isle Royale MI on July 1st 1978 (the day she went missing). However, Isle Royale is an \*island\* in the middle of Lake Superior. The second source on this case states that some of Mary's belongings were found in Thunder Bay, also on July 1st. Somehow, Mary made it across the lake in the ferry to Minnesota, crossed at Pigeon River, travelled about 63km east to Thunder Bay, wandered up Riverside Drive, lost her stuff somehow, and that same stuff was discovered on the same day. Either Mary had an extremely busy day on the day she went missing; or something has been misreported.

Preface: Most of this information comes from a recent video done by one of my favorite true crime Youtubers, Danelle Hallan, who spoke closely with the mother of Jesse’s children to learn this information.


**BACKGROUND:**
Jesse was 29 years old when he vanished from Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 2015. Jesse was dating a woman named Rachel whomp with they had 2 kids together. He was an amazing father, and loved outdoor activities, including fishing, hiking, and camping. However, prior to his disappearance, his behavior changed.

On August 1st, 2015, Jesse and Rachel got into an argument over money. Rachel had noticed large sums of money vanishing over time. They eventually settled the argument, but Jesse decided to stay at his grandparent’s house a few miles from Tamaqua, rather than where he was living with Rachel in Tamaqua. It’s interesting to note that Jesse did not have a car. Jesse’s behavior also started to change shortly prior to his disappearance, and he seemed exhausted, nervous, and worried. 

August 8th, 2015 was the last time that Rachel saw Jesse. She asked what was going on due to his recent behavior. Jesse responded something odd, saying, “I have to do this on my own, but when it’s over we’ll all be together again.

On August 10th, Jesse ditched work where he worked at an icecream plant. He left his grandparent’s house for work like normal, but rather went into Tamaqua. Witnesses said around 3pm he was seen alone at Burger King. Later that day, he supposedly met with a young woman somewhere for an unknown reason and she ended up stealing some of his money. After that, he met up with some friends and played video games all night. One friend mentioned he was irritated the woman took his money, and was Facebook messaging her boyfriend. Her boyfriend was allegedly apologizing and offered to repay him.

**DISAPPEARANCE**
On August 11th, 2015, Jesse told coworkers he would be headed to work. He first had planned on meeting with the woman’s boyfriend (the woman who Jesse claimed stole his money) at the local Burger King in Tamaqua, but never showed up. Jesse’s whereabouts are unknown from 12pm-9pm. However, Jesse’s phone records show he made multiple calls to his bank to figure out what his balance was. He shouldn’t have been expecting any payments, as he got paid biweekly every Friday.

At 9pm, Jesse made a bizarre phone call to Rachel. He was frantic and told her he was being chased by 10-11 coyotes, his phone was about to die, and he was up in a tree. He asked Rachel to come get him and bring guns. Rachel reported he seemed terrified in the call, almost as if he was about to cry. During the call, he initially told Rachel he was by the Tamaqua elementary school, and then later said he was near the high school. The two schools are on opposite sides of the town. Rachel asked for his exact location, which he would’ve known, but the call dropped. She called him back numerous times, but he never answered again.

Rachel and her brother went to the woods by the high school and spent 2.5 hours looking for Jesse for any sign of him. Rachel then called the police and reported Jesse missing.

**AFTERMATH**
The next day, police as well as friends and family began looking for him. On August 13th, the official search started. Different Search and Rescue  teams searched for almost 12 hours, including drones and dog teams. Pennsylvania State Police even sent a helicopter to look for him. From August 14-16, more teams were sent to look for him, and cameras were sent down into air shafts. August 16 end of day, TPD ends official search. Note that the area is an active coal mine, so there are many air shafts and the terrain is difficult to navigate. 


Jesse’s friend, who he stayed with August 10th, later told Rachel Jesse and to buy meth that night. Rachel says that Jesse never used drugs when they were together.

In December 2015 or 2016 (unsure of the exact year), a hunter near the high school saw a pair of sweatpants hanging from the tree, and Jesse was last seen wearing sweatpants. One of the legs of the sweatpants had been tied in a knot with a rock put inside the leg. He then noticed a backpack further up the tree, which was later confirmed to be Jesse’s backpack. Rachel doesn’t believe this is his bag, because she claims the pin on the bag used to identify it as Jesse’s is in her son’s possession. Both Rachel and Jesse’s mom believe these items were possibly planted at that location. The tree where these items were found is supposedly very hard to reach, and is a skinny tree.

People in town continue to refuse to speak about Jesse or give much information whatsoever. Police are not ruling out that he was attacked by a pack of coyotes nor a gang of “coyotes”. 

**Theories:**

-Jesse was in a drug-induced hallucination.
- Jesse was actually chased by coyotes.
- Jesse  was being chased by a street gang named “Coyotes”. Rumors were spreading that Jesse may have been talking about “Coyotes” as in a street gang that he allegedly owed money to. However, police couldn’t find any known gangs named Coyotes, nor proof anyone was after Jesse.

161,FogHorn650,1642031848,"Holly Ann Campiglia began running away from home when she was an 18 year old freshman at Glassboro State College in New Jersey. Holly Ann’s mother claimed that issues had began the year before while she was a senior in High School. “That's when she began taking drugs and having emotional problems. We don't know if one triggered another” said Mrs Campaglia. When Holly Ann ran away the first time she was found a month later walking on Route 70 about a mile away from the family home on Forest hill Road, off Springdale Road. She would go on to run away four more times. “Each time she came back she was less responsive to the medical treatment (she took for emotional problems” said Mrs Campiglia. Her mother says the last time she saw her daughter was when she jumped from the car while going to a counseling center on June 10, 1980. “She said she wanted to get on with her life - ‘I want to see the world and do things my way.’ I tried to pull her back, but the car was on route 70 near the Sheraton Poste, and I couldn't hold onto her.” (Today this address is 1450 Marlton Pike East, Cherry Hill) Her mother informed the Cherry Hill Police Department. “We didn't hear from her for a month, until we got a letter. It said she was living with two guys and … we should try not to think of her anymore. We tried to trace the letter, but the return address wasn't a real street.” The letter was mailed from Sacramento in July, 1980. All further leads went cold.

On August 3rd 1980 a body was found in a Cornfield about a half mile north of Seivers Road and east of Stevenson’s Bridge Road near Dixon, California. (30 Minutes away from Sacramento) The unidentified female was believed to be 15-17 years of age. She was 5’2 and weighed 115 pounds. She had brown eyes and brown hair. It was noted that she had a “Punk rock style” hair cut. She had a small dark mole on the left side of her chin. Her cause of death had been multiple gunshot wounds.

Holly Ann Campiglia was identified as a murder Victim on June 19th 1992 11 years and 11 months after her parents listed her missing. The Campiglia's say their daughters name was accidentally dropped from the computer list of missing persons two weeks before her body was found in Dixon, California. She was shot six times in the head. Cherry Hill New Jersey is about 2,800 miles away from Dixon, California. Her case remains unsolved. No internet articles or sources exist. Newspaper.com has newspapers that provided the facts above.

\- 5 Gunshot Wounds is excessive. 

\- Dixon and the surrounding area had a reputation at the time for a dumping ground for bodies. 

\- The Short Hair at the time may have been an attempt to disguise Holly while traveling, or delay identification of the body. 

\- Are There any similar cases in the surrounding area ?

177,PrincessNutNut,1641986048,"A person has been arrested in the unsolved case of three British people and a cyclist shot dead in the French Alps more than nine years ago.

Saad al Hilli, 50, was killed with his wife Iqbal, 47, and mother-in-law Suhaila al Allaf, 74, near Lake Annecy on 5 September 2012.

They were shot at point-blank range in a lay-by as they sat in their BMW.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, also died after being shot seven times.

Mr and Mrs al Hillis' young daughters survived. Zeena, four, hid in the footwell, while her sister, Zainab, seven, was shot and beaten.

The prosecutor in Annecy said today that an arrest has been made, and French media are reporting house searches are taking place.

It comes after police returned to examine the scene of the murders in October last year.

No one has ever been charged in relation to the murders, which prompted a search of the family's home in Claygate, Surrey.

Last year, detectives were investigating a possible link between the al-Hilli deaths and a gang of contract killers living in Paris.

One of the gang members was found to have pistol rounds similar to the ones fired from the gun that killed the victims.

""**Police are analysing ""numerous"" devices seized from two men arrested over the disappearance of a teenager in 2007.**

Officers investigating Andrew Gosden's disappearance from Doncaster [**said they had been arrested on suspicion of kidnap and human trafficking**](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-59952786).

Police said it could take ""six to 12 months"" to analyse the devices.

Andrew's father Kevin said the arrests over his son's disappearance, who was 14 at the time, had ""intensified"" an emotional time for the family.

The men, aged 38 and 45, were arrested in London on 8 December with the assistance of officers from the Metropolitan Police. It is believed they are the first arrests in the case.

The older man was also arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children, South Yorkshire Police said.

In a statement Mr Gosden said: ""We understand that police investigations will take several months to complete, so until that is the case, we do not know what to think and do not wish to speculate on any possible outcome.""

He added: ""We have carried the burden of not knowing for many years and recent potential developments represent a more intensified period of this emotional journey for us.""

On the day of his disappearance on 14 September, 2007, Andrew skipped school and withdrew just under £200 from his bank account before buying a one-way ticket to London.

He was last seen on CCTV footage arriving at King's Cross Station and since then police have been unable to corroborate his movements.

https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/01/29/dna-evidence-leads-to-killer-in-shocking-miracle-mile-triple-murder/

On May 5, 2003, Byung Song, returned to his Koreatown, Los Angeles Apartment to find his wife Charis, his infant son Nathan and their nanny, Eun Suk shot to death in the bathroom.  The investigation revealed that Chais died at least 30 minutes after the other two and she  had been bound and gagged before she was killed.  Charis had been out running errands earlier that morning and it has been speculated that the murderer had arrived before Chatis returned.  The murderer may have gained entry to the apartment without force, killed the nanny and child and waited for Charis to return home.  It is noteworthy that Charis was bound and gagged rather than killed as soon as she got home.  There is the possibility that the killer was trying to get information from her.  The only forensic evidence was some pieces of rubber believed to have come from household gloves, that contained DNA that could not be identified.

Initially, suspicion fell on the husband.  He was a successful business owner in the garment industry.  He was a bit of a philanderer but otherwise had a good reputation.  He had a solid alibi and the DNA on the piece of rubber was not his.  His 
Position as prime suspect was enhanced when LAPD received an anonymous letter claiming he had hired hit men from Korea to do the job and he had a girlfriend who was hiding out in New York.  Police could not figure out who wrote the letter and the girlfriend was never identified.  The case went cold.

8 years later, CODIS got a hit on the DNA.  The DNA belonged to Robin Cho, a Korean immigrant whose only known connection to the Songs was that he has lived in the same apartment building at the the time of the murders and his parking slip was adjacent to the Song’s.  No evidence was ever found that Cho knew the Songs or had any dealings with them.  The reason Cho’s DNA “hit” when it did was that Cho had recently been convicted of a felony and, under California law, felons must have their DNA entered on the CODIS data base.  The crime Cho had been convicted of was White Collar:  Running a Ponzi scheme.  What he had done was to attempt to operate an investment group without any legal status; something fairly common within the Korean community, and things went bad.  He used new investments to pay off earlier investors who wanted out.  Eventually it all went to the shits and people went to the police.  He pled guilty but served no prison time.

Cho was arrested for the murders based on the DNA evidence alone.  The prosecution suggested that it may have been a burglary gone bad but nothing was missing from the apartment.  There was an unstated suspicion that Cho was hired by Songs husband to do the murder but there was no evidence to that effect.  The prosecution was under no obligation to provide a motive.  Cho denied all involvement and the only explanation for his DNA being at the crime scene was that next to each parking slip at the apartments, there was a storage box that was unsecured.  He had some cleaning supplies that included rubber gloves.  He suggested that the murderer used the Songs’ parking slip and took advantage of Cho’s gloves that were in his storage container.  Cho had moved out of the apartment years before his arrest and there was no evidence of what had been in the storage container.

Cho was convicted and given a life sentence.  The prosecution expected him to make a deal by exposing who had put him up to the murders.  Instead, he continues, to this day, to proclaim his innocence.

It seems to me that a small amount of DNA, in itself, is not enough evidence to meet the standard for conviction.  There was nothing else linking him to the crime.  It is certainly possible that someone arriving at the apartment, intent on murdering Charis, might have rummaged around a storage box for something that might help with the crime.",UnresolvedMysteries,The Koreatown Murders 2003.

""Alice"" was found loitering outside of a restaurant in Paris on December 16, 2005. The owner was suspicious of her and called the police. When questioned, she could or would not identify herself or where she was from. She sometimes would cry when questioned.

Authorities then relocated Alice to Montreuil-sous-Bois, an emergency home for juveniles. However, an x-ray of her hand determined she was an adult anywhere from 18 to 30 years old.

One item she had on her person was  a quote written in German on a piece of paper in one of her pockets. Alice is a white woman with a pierced tongue, dark brown hair and brown eyes. She understands French well. 

I hope she's doing well.

Houston Institute of Forensic Sciences and audiochuck, announces the identification of

1981 Harris County murder victims as then 21 year-old Harold Dean Clouse and spouse

17 year-old Tina Gail Linn.

&amp;#x200B;

The newlywed couple, who married in June 1979, was found together in a heavily

wooded area 100 feet south of Wallifville Rd. in Houston, TX. They had been deceased

approximately two months prior to their discovery on January 12, 1981, when a dog

living nearby led searchers to their remains. Mr. Clouse was found beaten, bound and

gagged. Ms. Linn had been strangled.

&amp;#x200B;

The couple left their home in Volusia County, Florida in 1981 with their one year-old

baby for Mr. Clouse to pursue carpentry work in Texas. Soon after, the couple’s car was

returned to the family by a stranger who led them to believe the couple had joined a

religious group and no longer wanted contact with the family.

&amp;#x200B;

The couple’s bodies were exhumed in July 2011 by Dr. Jennifer Love, Forensic

Anthropology Director of the Identification Unit at the Harris County Medical

Examiner's office for the purpose of collecting DNA to determine if the two were related.

In 2021 the genealogy research was funded through audiochuck, an Indianapolis-based

media company that produces CrimeJunkies, a popular true crime podcast. Working

with case manager and forensic anthropologist Deborrah Pinto at the Harris County

Institute of Forensic Sciences, the case was solved by Identifinders Senior Forensic

Genealogist Misty Gillis and former colleague Allison Peacock. Gillis identified Harold

Dean Clouse within 10 days of taking the case. When his family mentioned his wife was

also missing, Peacock was able to identify the other murder victim as his wife Tina Gail

Linn. “I'm very thankful to have been given the opportunity to work on this case. It was

a difficult case emotionally.” commented Gillis.

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick, President of Identifinders International added “We are pleased

that the Forensic Science Institute placed its confidence in us and we were able to bring

closure to the Clouse and Linn families after so long. We thank audiochuck for their

generous support in funding the work on this case.""

&amp;#x200B;

But the closure of these cases has led to another mystery: the whereabouts of their baby

Hollie Marie. No baby was found with the couple’s bodies and so far no Baby Doe cases

have been found that match her description.

&amp;#x200B;

Work is continuing to file a missing persons report and list Hollie Marie Clouse with the

National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Anyone with

If you want to follow along with Mr. Fish's murders, look at this trail map: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1KBb7wl42SyL4aDZu7Ij2yqnV1dU&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.693515091142984%2C-74.04155100000003&amp;z=12](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1KBb7wl42SyL4aDZu7Ij2yqnV1dU&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=40.693515091142984%2C-74.04155100000003&amp;z=12)

Albert Fish was an American serial killer, child rapist and a cannibal. He was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime. Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair.

This is from Wikipedia, and yes I know, Wikipedia, but here it is anyway:

""One of his many victims was 4 year old Billy Gaffney. On February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in Brooklyn with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said ""the bogeyman took him."" Gaffney's body was never recovered. Initially, serial killer Peter Kudzinowski was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a Brooklyn trolley, saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the old man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the ""bogeyman"" matched Fish's. Police matched the description of the child to Billy Gaffney. Detectives of the Manhattan Missing Persons Bureau were able to establish that Fish was employed as a house painter by a Brooklyn real estate company during February 1927 and that on the day of Billy Gaffney's disappearance he was working at a location a few miles away from where the boy was abducted.

The following text is **NSFW**. Viewer discretion is advised.

You have been **warned**.

The following is a confession by Albert Fish to his attorney. The full version was located in Harold Schechter's book *Deranged.* Schechter mentions at the end of his book that he spoke personally with Albert Fish's attorney, James Dempsey, before writing the book. It provided him with an amazing insight into the mind of Fish.

""Not satisfied there, I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a house that stands alone, not far from where I took him A few yrs. ago I painted this house for the man who owns it. He is in the auto wrecking business. I forgot his name but my son Henry can tell you, because he bought a car from him. This man's father lives in the house. Gene, John and Henry helped me paint the house. There were at the time a number of old autos along the road. I took the G boy there. Stripped him naked and tied his hands and feet and gagged him with a piece of dirty rag I picked out of the dump. Then I burned his clothes. Threw his shoes in the dump. Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy cat-of-nine tails. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears – nose – slit his mouth from ear to ear. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head – feet – arms – hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep. They sank at once. I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears – nose – pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.""

Billy Gaffney's body was NEVER found.

""I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a house that stands alone, not far from where I took him A few yrs. ago I painted this house for the man who owns it. He is in the auto wrecking business. I forgot his name but my son Henry can tell you, because he bought a car from him. This man's father lives in the house. Gene, John and Henry helped me paint the house. There were at the time a number of old autos along the road. I took the G boy there.""

Fish describes bringing Billy to the Riker Ave. dumps, and a quick google search of this area will lead you to nowhere in particular. But, he does mention the house where he took Billy to. Albert Fish's son Henry bought a car from him before the murder, which was pre-February 1927. Also, Fish had painted the house beforehand. There may be some sort of record(s), either relating to the automobile purchase or the the painting of the house, dating back to this time that can identify where this house is today. If this was discovered, then we could know where the actual murder took place.

""I cut off the head – feet – arms – hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep.""

Road going to North Beach? Looking this up on google will also lead you to nothing, at first at least.

Then again, this did take place in 1927, and things were named differently back then and are completely different now. Let's start with the so called Riker Avenue dumps. The closest thing to being called ""Riker's Ave."" in Brooklyn is Rikers Island, which sits just north of modern day LaGuardia Airport. (with the help of reddit user oldspice75): But in 1927, there was a street in this area named ""Riker's Avenue"" which is now called 19th Avenue today. This leads directly to LaGuardia Airport.

Image of Astoria, Queens from today, showing 19th avenue (just under the Rikers Island Bridge) [https://gyazo.com/b5c92ed40e13abc321bb9564e6a8fefb](https://gyazo.com/b5c92ed40e13abc321bb9564e6a8fefb)

Image from 1924: (around the time the murder took place) [https://gyazo.com/c53ddcc42b7a5ab073d91a187ea947c8](https://gyazo.com/c53ddcc42b7a5ab073d91a187ea947c8)

Image from 2012: [https://gyazo.com/e630efdb8376bf65a2ba526a3f68525f](https://gyazo.com/e630efdb8376bf65a2ba526a3f68525f)

These are three comparison images.

Now you may be wondering why I keep alluding to LaGuardia Airport so much, and this is why:

LaGuardia Airport sits on the land that used to be Gala Amusement Park. Built and operated in the 1870s, the park closed in the mid-1920s, around a little before the time Albert Fish murdered Billy Gaffney. This area was eventually turned into an airfield, and then was named ""LaGuardia Airport."" BUT, this park was also known as ""North Beach.""

Now, we have a Riker's Island situated right above a park known as North Beach in 1924, and a a Riker's Island also situated right above the LaGuardia Airport today. The road leading to present day LaGuardia Airport is 19th Avenue, or what was once known was ""Rikers Avenue""

Detailed image of Rikers Avenue (present day 19th Avenue) leading to North Beach (present day LaGuardia Aiport) from 1930 (excuse my poor mspaint skills): [https://gyazo.com/d532ddb98676b7609052f4a8f2fa5e03](https://gyazo.com/d532ddb98676b7609052f4a8f2fa5e03)

Possible location of where the murder took place, seems to be an area of dumps and could be where the house was located: [https://gyazo.com/adb6485ae559637f8682c6dc69b18252](https://gyazo.com/adb6485ae559637f8682c6dc69b18252)

All of these locations are only around 10 miles from Brooklyn to Rikers Island/Avenue/North Beach. This would mean that Albert Fish abducted Gaffney in Brooklyn, took him to or near Rikers Avenue, murdered him, and dumped his body in pools of water along Rikers Avenue to the North Beach amusement park in 1927. With all of this said, could this mean that Billy Gaffney's remains are still lying underwater near LaGuardia Airport or even underground the airport itself?

It's highly unlikely that his remains are still even a remnant of it's former self or even recognizable since this murder took place over almost 90 years ago, but this could be the actual location where Albert Fish laid Billy Gaffney to rest.

I often wondered where the actual murder took place as well. I think the closest I have come to narrowing it down was when I read *Deranged: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Fiendish Killer* by Harold Schechter. In it is Albert Fish's extended confession to murdering Billy Gaffney. It is located on pg. 294 of 312 - Location 3828 of 4002 in the Kindle edition.

Fish stated, ""Not satisfied there, I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a *house* that stands alone, not far from where I took him. A few yrs. ago I painted this house for the man who owns it. He is in the auto wrecking business. I forget his name but my son Henry can tell you, because he bought a car from him. This man's father lives in the house. Gene, John, Henry helped me paint the house. There were at the time a number of old autos along the road. I took the G boy there.""

If there are any surviving records of Fish's son Henry buying that man's vehicle, or any information of Fish scheduling a paint job in the mid-1920s, then we could at least determine where Billy was murdered.

Let me know what you all think.

I will include more details that can help you all out if need be, I just wanted to make this as short as possible to get my point across.

Let me just say that I am only just trying to help shed some light on this case and get some more input from you all. It is sort of a theory post on where Billy Gaffney's body may have been laid to rest. Recovering his remains after this long may be virtually impossible and that is not my goal. I am just trying to speculate where his remains were placed, since his body was never found, and that in and of itself is terrifying. It seems to haunt me ever since the day I first read about it.

Case details: 


Andrew Gosden was last seen on September 14th 2007 aged 14 years. 

On the day of his disappearance, Andrew left his family home in Doncaster, UK at 8:05am. Instead of taking the bus to school, he diverted his route and waited in a local park until the rest of the household had left. He then returned home, changed out of his school uniform and into a Slipknot band T-shirt and jeans. He also had a bag embellished with patches of rock bands, within he carried his wallet, keys, and PlayStation Portable console (but no charger). 

At 8:30am he left home once again and made his way to Doncaster railway station via a cash machine where he withdrew £200 from his bank account which contained £214. He purchased a one way ticket to London Kings Cross station on the 9:35am train. 

CCTV shows Andrew leaving Kings across station at 11:25am. This was the last confirmed sighting of him. 

-

Due to a misdialled number from the school, his parents were not notified that he had failed to attend school. It was not until 7:00pm that Police we’re called by Andrew’s parents who had discovered he was not home, was not with friends, and had truanted from school. 

Various witnesses saw Andrew on his day of disappearance including a woman on his train and the ticket vendor at Doncaster train station. The ticket vendor commented to Police that Andrew had refused a return ticket despite the price only being a small amount more than the single. 

It was three weeks before the Metropolitan Police in London obtained the footage of Andrew leaving Kings Cross. Due to the delay, no other footage of him has been discovered as it was most likely erased. 


-

Theories:

1/ Andrew’s family and Police investigated the possibility that he has traveled to London to meet someone whom he had met over the internet however no evidence was found of this. Andrew didn’t use the computer at home and he had no social media presence or email address. 

2/ Andrew’s reason for travelling to London on that day is unknown but it was not his first visit to the capital. He was familiar with London as he had visited family members who lived there. His family commented that he enjoyed the museums and was confident in navigating the city.  He had however not notified his family that he would be visited, and had in fact failed to visit  on a scheduled trip in the months prior. 

3/ Two bands who Andrew enjoyed were playing in London on the night of his disappearance. Thirty Seconds to Mars we’re performing at the Brixton Academy and SikTh we’re playing their last show at the Carling Academy. Police appealed for images from the concerts to contact them so ‘super recognisers’ could scan them for Andrew. No leads ever came from this.

I was wondering if the same approach could be applied to John and Jane Does. How far along are we from clearing the unidentified backlog in the US? How impactful has the recent surge in identifications been when compared to the entire backlog?  


I can't seem to find enough data to draw meaningful conclusions. Best I could find was this:  


[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_decedent#cite_ref-4) claims there were approximately 40,000 unidentified decedents in the United States as of 2006.  
The NamUs about page claims that 4400 unidentified bodies are recovered each year and that about 1000 (23%) of them stay unidentified - their source ([here](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/meco04.pdf)) is from 2004 though.  
Their [FAQ page](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/frequently-asked-questions#faq-what-is-the-extent-of-the-unidentified-person) says they have about 13000 active unidentified person cases in the database and that it grows by about 1000 each year. (no sources cited)

Does anyone have better data on:

* how many unidentified decedents are there in the US?
* how many add up to the list each year?
* how many of them were identified per year before genetic genealogy became widespread? How many of them after?  


Or even better: does anyone know about any sociologist, criminologist, statistician or other that has comprehensively studied this phenomenon?

194,Forensic-Alli,1641922380,"BREAKING: 1981 Harris County Texas murder victims Harold Dean Clouse and Tina Gail Linn Clouse were recently identified by the Identifinders International team of Misty Gillis and Allison Peacock. Their bodies were found on January 12, 1981 in a heavily wooded area 100 feet south of Wallisville Road in Houston, Texas.

Formerly known online as the “Harris County Does” (NamUS UP701 &amp; UP703) before a large Wikipedia edit, the couple remained unidentified until October 2021 when the science of Whole Genome Sequencing and and the investigative discipline of genetic genealogy were used to finally give them back their identities.

Dean and Tina were natives of New Smyrna Beach, Florida where they were married in 1979. In 1980, they left Florida for Houston where Dean or “Junior” was offered a job with builder D.R. Horton building custom cabinets in new homes. They later moved to Lewisville, near Dallas and were not heard from after early December 1980 when Tina send home pictures of the couple’s year-old daughter to Dean’s mother in Florida.

Dean was periodically involved with a religious group known either as The Brethren or the Jesus People with ties to Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma and may have reconnected with them in Texas. His car was found in Los Angeles several months after the couple was murdered. Someone calling herself Sister Suzanne attempted to extort money from Dean’s mother for the return of the car to Daytona Speedway in Florida in mid-1981. The family had no way of knowing that the couple was already dead and met them hoping to get answers to their whereabouts. They were told, ""they're happy with our group now, they don't want to see you or talk to you.""

At the time of their deaths, Dean and Tina had a one-year-old infant named Holly Marie. The baby, who would now be 42 years old, has not been seen since late 1980. Family History Detectives® is the custodian of the AncestryDNA profile of many of Holly Marie Clouse’s family members on both sides, maternal and paternal. Key profiles have also been uploaded to GEDmatch.

[Elena Sanchez Hawkins ](https://uncovered.com/cases/elena-hawkins) was a young mother of two boys. She was [known to keep to herself](https://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/who-killed-elena-sanchez-hawkins)  and was usually with her family or working as an attendant at a local gas station. Elena and her family lived in a small town in Elizabethtown, KY, which was approximately 45 minutes south of Louisville.

**The day Elena was murdered.** On the morning of January 8, 1992, Elena’s husband, Michael Hawkins, left early for work at a local convenience store. Elena was home with her two young boys. By 7AM, Michael called Elena to make sure that their eldest son was awake and made the school bus. But no one answered, possibly because she was walking her eldest son to the bus stop.

Around 7:30AM a neighbor recalls seeing an older model black Datsun pickup truck leaving Elena’s home. The truck can be described as having a short bed, no chrome and a standard cab as well as “tie-down” hooks and a “metal” topper on the bed. 

**When she was discovered.** By 10AM, Michael calls again to make sure that their eldest son made the bus. [Their 3 year old son answered the phone and told him “mommy’s bleeding”. Michael immediately rushed home and found his wife dead in the living room of their family home.](https://uncovered.com/cases/elena-hawkins) Police were called promptly thereafter and would find no sign of forced entry. It is believed that Elena may have known her assailant. Before Elena was killed, she worked for a local gas station on West Dixie Avenue where she reported that a man gave her strange looks and made her feel uncomfortable.

When Elena’s body was discovered in her living room; it was noted that her throat was cut, her wrists bound and she was sexually assaulted prior to her death. Her cause of death was extreme blood loss. An investigation ensued, and her husband, Michael was cleared as a suspect very early in the process. Unfortunately, little leads surfaced and the case stalled.

**Where the case stands today.** Elena’s case remains unsolved. The most recent update revolves around a possible person of interest. In August 2008, this individual was convicted of another similar crime in Breckinridge County; a woman was assaulted and throat cut in her home. [She pretended to be dead in hopes that the attacker would leave, before she was able to call for help.](https://www.wave3.com/story/9301595/recent-attack-may-help-police-solve-1992-murder-case/) This individual had previously lived in Elizabethtown during the time of Elena’s attack. While this individual has been named a possible person of interest, it is unclear if he has been interviewed in connection to Elena’s case.

Is it possible Elena knew her killer? Could this individual be connected to Elena's murder? Did this individual have other victims? Who was driving the Datsun pickup truck that morning? [Have you seen the black Datsun truck in the Elizabethtown area? ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datsun_Truck)

The villages of Upper and Lower Quinton in Warwickshire are unlikely to come to mind when you think of a horrible crime that has gone unsolved for nearly 70 years. Both communities are approximately as rural and sleepy as any other village in the United Kingdom.

Walton had spent his entire life in Lower Quinton, and despite his age and the start of rheumatism, he did modest farm activities whenever he could. Although the popular and well-liked retiree had an eccentric side, some people were suspicious of him. Walton had several idiosyncrasies that distinguished him apart from the other inhabitants in a community where everyone pretty much knew everyone else.

Walton was found cruelly killed in a ditch after a swift search. The hook he used to catch him was lodged in his throat. The pitchfork impaled him to the ground so forcefully that it required the assistance of police officers to remove it. His chest had been carved with a big crucifix, and the blood from the wound had soaked into the ground beneath him.

Police disclosed that they investigated the same location during the early stages of the investigation and discovered nothing.",UnresolvedMysteries,The Charles Walton Witchcraft Murder,0

210,corilee93,1641903170,"The 1947 Los Angeles “unsolved” murder of Elizabeth Short (aka the “Black Dahlia”) is often considered an unsolved murder, but it’s not really.

- Chief of Detectives Thad Brown: “The Black Dahlia case was solved. He was a doctor who lived on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood.”

- LAPD Chief of Police William H. Parker: “We identified the Black Dahlia suspect. He was a doctor.”

- LASD Undersheriff James Downey: “The Black Dahlia case was solved, but it will never come out. It was a doctor they all knew in Hollywood involved in abortions.”

- DA Lt. Frank Jemison: “We know who the Black Dahlia killer was. He was a doctor but we didn’t have enough to put him away.”

His name was George Hodel Jr. To her credit, Kail mentions him as one of the ‘possible suspects’. He first came under suspicion following the death of his secretary Ruth Spaulding. It’s suspected that he killed her to cover up financial fraud (billing patients for tests never performed) and to protect his illegal abortion ring. He was also accused of raping his own daughter, Tamar Hodel. His son Steve Hodel is responsible for bringing his father’s crimes to public attention.

The DA has tapes of George saying “supposin’ I did kill the Black Dahlia. They can’t prove it now. They can’t talk to my secretary anymore because she’s dead. They thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it out. Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary.”

It may have been UNPROSECUTED, but it was never unsolved.

I live nearby enough to have visited Elizabeth’s gravesite - it’s always decorated with red lipsticks, flowers, and cigarettes. All these years later, she’s still remembered. I wish she had some kind of justice, but she wasn’t left without a legacy - two weeks after her murder, state assemblyman C. Don Field was prompted by the case to introduce a bill calling for the formation of a sex offender registry. With this, the state of California would become the first state to make the registration of sex offenders mandatory.

216,gaycatdetective,1641876481,"Before you read, please note that while there has been a conviction in Sally's case, it is extremely obvious who is responsible for her disappearance and likely death, and it may not *seem* like an ""Unresolved Mystery"" to some, let me reiterate ***her remains have never been recovered***. Sally is still a missing person and her family still deserves closure.

**Background**

In 1976, Sally Brown met Gary Rawlings in Pennsylvania. The couple married in Denver, Colorado in 1977. Sally became Sally Rawlings and fell out of contact with her family. She gave birth to a daughter, Kimberly, in 1980. The family moved to Oklahoma City in late 1981.

At this time, they had a difficult relationship. Gary had a temper and was abusive to Sally. On January 12, 1982, Sally filed for divorce. The divorce was granted on February 24, 1982 and Sally was awarded custody of Kimberly. Sally and her daughter moved into Passageway, a YWCA shelter for victims of domestic abuse. She had a history of past mental health issues and engaged in counseling while staying at the shelter. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 

In March 1982, Sally and her daughter moved again, this time into the Kirkpatrick Hotel, located in downtown Oklahoma City. She reportedly chose this location due to the secured locked front doors. On March 21, police were called to the Kirkpatrick Hotel where Sally was staying. Gary had failed to return Kimberly on time after his scheduled visitation. He arrived at the hotel around 9 pm without Kimberly, and an argument followed. During the argument, he hit Sally in the head. She had a large gash in her head and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Sally told authorities Gary had also stolen important documents from her, including Kimberly's birth certificate. Gary told Sally the next time she saw him, she would be dead. Eventually, Gary returned Kimberly to her mother and agreed to forgo visitation with her for six months.

Later that same month, she began a job as a secretary at the Kerr-McGee Corporation. Over the course of the next two months, she developed a reputation as a good employee who kept to herself and was just a bit odd. She was overheard talking to herself on multiple occasions. 

At this time, Kimberly was enrolled in daycare. Sally would drop her off everyday before work around 8 am and pick her up after work, generally between 5-5:30 pm. She also began looking into local rental properties, paying a private company $45.00 to help locate housing. She had on appointment on May 27 to find out if she qualified for rent assistance from the OKC Housing Authority. Although things seemed like they were turning around for Sally, she would sadly never make her appointment.

On May 26, 1982, Sally ate breakfast with her daughter at a café located inside the Kirkpatrick Hotel, then dropped her off at the daycare center at her usual time. After that, she was never seen again. She did not arrive to work that day. Around lunchtime, the daycare received a call from Gary, who told them Sally would not be able to pick Kimberly up that evening. He requested the director take Kimberly home with them for the night.

Around lunchtime on May 27, 1982, Gary arrived at the day care center in a rental car. He gave them a letter from Sally that stated she was moving to Florida, leaving Kimberly in his care. The daycare gave Kimberly to Gary. Gary then called his mother, Loretta Rawlings, from the airport in Oklahoma City and asked her to pick them up from the airport in Denver. He also asked her to bring a uniform for him because he had to go back to work right after they landed. 

When she met them at the airport, he had only a blue suitcase and a plastic sack containing Kimberly's belongings. He told her Sally had gone to Florida with a boyfriend and had allowed him to keep their daughter for 30 days. He put the suitcase in her car and returned to work, and she took Kimberly home with her. 

The next day, May 28, Loretta opened the suitcase belonging to her son and was shocked to find a gun. Specifically, a .44 caliber Magnum in a wood case. This scared her, and she took the suitcase to her daughter's house in Littleton, Colorado, and called police. When police arrived, Loretta said she knew her son had killed his ex-wife. She showed them the gun and other contents of the suitcase, which included:

* typewritten letters to movers and the Kirkpatrick Hotel with Sally's signature
* velour cleaner
* Sally's work keys
* receipt for a car rental
* Sally's savings deposit book
* Kimberly's birth certificate
* a photo of Sally and Kimberly

Loretta did not believe the signature was Sally's, but her son's. He was arrested and charged with Sally's murder. It is believed he abducted her at gunpoint, forced her into his rental car, drove her to a remote location and shot her, then dropped her body from a plane somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico. Authorities were able to construct a timeline of Gary's movements before and after the murder.

**Gary's Movements**

**May 4, 1982**: Gary traveled to OKC and stayed in the Bel Aire Motel.

**May 11, 1982**: From his parents' home in Colorado, called the same motel and made a reservation for May 24-25

**May 24-25 1982**: Gary purchased $20.00 in traveler's checks before flying to OKC. He was carrying a sleeping bag with him. He told his mother he was going to visit Kimberly and needed the sleeping bag to stay at a friend's house. Upon arrival, he rented a yellow Plymouth Fury. On the 24th or 25th, a man claiming to be Kimberly's father called the daycare center she was enrolled in and asked what would happen if Sally did not pick her up in the evening. He was told the director would take Kimberly home with them for the night. Gary also responded to a newspaper ad to purchase a .44 Magnum handgun. He told the owner he wanted it for squirrel hunting. He bought the gun and nine rounds of ammunition for three traveler's checks and some cash.

**May 26, 1982**: Gary had made six reservations to rent a Cessna 150 during the month of May, but canceled the first five. He kept his reservation for May 26 and arrived at the airport in the yellow Plymouth. He refueled at a Dallas airport and purchased velour cleaner. While there, he made two phone calls; one to his employer and one to Kimberly's daycare where he informed them Sally would not be picking Kimberly up. He refueled again at a Houston airport that afternoon, where attendants noticed a large cloth bundle in the rear baggage compartment. He refueled later that evening near a different Houston area airport and left behind a gas cap. Finally, around 11 pm, he refueled at Meacham Field in Fort Worth, where attendants noted that the plane's gas cap was missing.

**May 27, 1982**: Gary returned the plane, reporting 2.4 hours of flight time. An employee noticed an 8 hour discrepancy between the tack time and the Hobbs meter, the Hobbs meter had been disconnected, the gas cap was missing, and parts of the interior carpet were missing. He also returned the Plymouth, reporting he'd had trouble starting it, and requested a different car. He was given a blue Ford LTD, though employees reported they could not find any problem with the car, except that the mat from the trunk was missing. Gary then went to ABC Movers and arranged for Sally's furniture to be moved to Denver, where he said she was moving. Next, he picked Kimberly up from the daycare center. They then returned to Denver and were picked up by his mother who noted that he did not have the sleeping bag he'd left with.

**May 28, 1982**: Loretta finds the gun and other items in Gary's suitcase and calls police.

**June 1, 1982**: A letter allegedly from Sally was sent to ABC Movers, containing two money orders, the original service order, and a letter authorizing them entry into the hotel.

**June 2, 1982**: Gary was arrested at his parents home in Colorado.

**June 3, 1982**: Kerr-McGee received a resignation letter allegedly from Sally.

**Evidence**

Although DNA testing was not available at the time, blood type testing was done on blood found on the gun and in the rental car and airplane that indicated the blood was NOT Gary's, but could have come from Sally.

A firearms expert determined that the .44 Magnum had been fired five time since it was last cleaned. It contained four live cartridges when turned over to police.

It was determined by a document examiner from the FBI that the letters allegedly sent from Sally could not have been typed on any typewriters she had access to, and had been typed on a machine at Gary's office. He also determined Gary had forged Sally's signature.

Gary's fingerprints were found on the envelope mailed to ABC Movers, and his palm print was found on one of the money orders.

Authorities believe damage to the plane he rented indicated Gary had landed at an uncontrolled airport to move the body from the luggage compartment to the front of the plane. Robert Macy, the district attorney at the time, said he could have ""taken off again, flown out over the gulf and banked the plane to the right with the engine stalled.  All you'd have to do is open the door and give her a little push and she'd be gone.""

**Follow Up**

Gary Rawlings was tried and convicted in 1983 for murdering Sally to gain custody of Kimberly. He argued that Sally was psychotic and went missing on her own accord. He was sentenced to life in prison after the jury deliberated for just one hour. His conviction was upheld in 1987.

**Thoughts**

Gary claimed Sally was psychotic and went missing by her own choice. I sadly could not find much information about this case, and could not determine if Gary is still alive today or not. If he still alive, there is a slim chance he could reveal where her remains actually are. 

If authorities' suspicions are correct and he did drop her somewhere over the Gulf of Mexico, what are the chances she could ever be recovered? 

Do you think there is a possibility he did not drop her into the Gulf, and her remains have either not been discovered or she is a Jane Doe?

I also wanted to share Sally's case because her page on The Charley Project is one of the craziest old and obscure cases I have read on there. I also find murder convictions without a body extremely interesting to read about. I've shared a couple of other cases like this in Oklahoma in this sub before:

217,RDruner870,1641871288,"Anyone who lived in the Pittsburgh area in December of 1988 likely remembers hearing the news that a severed head had been found in a Pittsburgh suburb only two days after Christmas. Three decades have passed and many may still remember the severed head while having forgotten exact details of this crazy unsolved murder in Pittsburgh. 

Panic ensued when a severed head was found in a bag in a dumpster in North Versailles on December 27, 1988. Several more body parts – including lungs and teeth – were found dumped in other Pittsburgh neighborhoods, including in Whitaker. Very few remains were recovered but what was found was enough to identify the victim as 22-year-old Anthony Michalowski. 

Anthony Michalowski often went off of the radar, sometimes for days at a time, and some painted him as a “drifter.” The 22-year-old from the North Side of Pittsburgh was last seen alive on Christmas Eve of 1988. Family and friends thought little of his being gone since they were used to his absences. Michalowski was unemployed and spent much of his free time on Liberty Avenue, known at the time as being a hub for prostitution. Some speculate that Michalowski himself was a prostitute, a claim that his family vehemently denied. 

Because only about 15 percent of Michalowski's body was found, Joshua Perper, the Allegheny County Coroner at the time, couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of death and, in turn, couldn't classify the death as a homicide. What was known was Michalowski had sedatives in his system, meaning he could have either been drugged or have overdosed before he was dismembered. Perper, however, asserts that Michalowski was either dead or unconscious when he was beheaded. 

The authorities received plenty of calls about potential human remains that had been found – many were the remains of deer and other animals – but solid tips were illusive. Law enforcement and the local media worked together, hosting a live call in show on WTAE, to gather tips from viewers. The case, however, pretty much went cold until 1992. 

Four years after the discovery of Michalowski's severed head, sanitation workers uncovered a thigh in a dumpster in Shadyside. Eventually, other body parts were recovered, all in trash bags placed in dumpsters around the city. Authorities identified the remains as those of 30-year-old Michael Hickmott. The victim, who had been disemboweled and dismembered like Michalowski, had been unemployed, although he had previously worked as a prostitute. 

Hickmott's death led authorities to a suspect who, according to The Beaver Valley Times, described himself as a “neo-nazi vampire.” Thirty eight year-old Robert Wayne Marshall wore his hair in a crew cut, often donned camouflage, and was said to be an alcoholic. Law enforcement found several connections to Marshall and Hickmott. The shoulder was found in a dumpster not far from Marshall's apartment and, even more incriminating, witnesses told police they had seen the two together the weekend before Hickmott's remains were discovered. 

Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Marshall on May 6, 1992, setting off a manhunt for the suspected murderer. Simultaneously, authorities contacted the FBI to determine if any unsolved cases shared any of the same characteristics of Hickmott's murder. Michalowski's death mirrored that of Hickmott's: Both men had been disemboweled and dismembered with their body parts scattered in several dumpsters. 

Marshall was never questioned or arrested in either Hickmott's or Michalowski's deaths. He committed suicide only two days after he was charged with Hickmott's murder. Marshall left a note, proclaiming his unhappiness and confusion, confessing that he would no longer be in this world by the time his friend received his letter. Authorities considered him a potential serial killer, with perhaps additional victims. 

Michalowski's murder remains unsolved, although the media has revisited the case numerous times, particularly around the Christmas holidays when Michalowski's body parts were first found. Marshall was perhaps law enforcement's strongest lead but hope of ever solving Michalowski's murder may have died with Marshall.

218,erobin37,1641869905,"To avoid an unintentional jumpscare by the reddit thumbnail, all links in this post will be split up.

“Jeff the Killer” (JTK) is the nickname for a heavily edited online image that was commonly used as a jumpscare in the 2010s. Over the years, many have tried to locate the original, unedited image of JTK. There are dedicated searches in the Anglosphere and Japan, where the image was thought to originate from. There’s even a subreddit, r/OriginalJTKImage.

The common “Jeff the Killer” image featured what appears to be a dark room, with a rotund, bright white face at the corner. The face had almost cartoonish, spherical eyes and a mouth in a wide grin. The person appeared to have long hair, parted in the middle.

**The search:**

The first step, naturally, was to find the oldest instance of the image, which might point us to its origin. This brings us to an image uploaded on a Japanese image hosting site pya.cc. Translated, the title of the image is “(Scary) Ahhhhhhh!”, and it was uploaded on 16th November 2005. \[1\]

Soon, people found an even older instance of the image. Uploaded on 10th September 2005, it was titled “White Powder (Part 2)” by the user “Mr. Mulholland”. \[2\] The image, also heavily edited, was less menacing than JTK. It featured different eyes and a smaller grin. Upon inspection, the JTK image appeared to have used the liquify or smudge tool on “White Powder (Part 2)” to expand its grin. It can be safely assumed that “White Powder (Part 2)” is the basis for JTK, though still not the original. I’ll call it Proto-JTK from here.

It is known that the eyes of Proto-JTK were photoshopped from a Mr. Potato Head figure. \[3\] The mouth is possible from a stock photo. \[4\]

A frenzied search for “White Powder (Part 1)” yielded nothing. People noted that on the same day when Proto-Jeff was uploaded, a photoshopped, creepified picture of a doll was also uploaded by Mr. Mulholland, who we can assume to be a horror fan. Was he just uploading photoshopped scary pictures for fun? Soon people noticed his personal blog, sorai.jp \[5\], linked from his account \[6\]. People also noticed an active twitter user, @miyama, who also linked to sorai.jp and shared some hobbies and interests as Mr. Mulholland. So naturally, with the power of Google translate, @miyama was questioned about Proto-JTK.

Responding to a question, miyama replied “To put it simply, in mid-2005, a cropped image of a video of a middle-aged Asian woman appeared in Japan. At that point \[her\] face was white. I edited a little in Photoshop to post to ""pya.cc"".” \[7\] He then elaborated that he only messed around with the brightness. Everything else was already from the image he found. The image, a crop of an Asian (possibly Japanese) woman from a video, was a “Japanese meme” being passed around on Japanese BBS. He doesn’t remember which BBS it was, as it was 15 years ago. He claimed he has seen the video in question once, but doubts that it exists on the internet. “The image I found is almost the same as white powder (Pt.2). I just made a few corrections. Therefore, the real creator is another person.” \[8\]

The search for a “Proto-Proto-JTK” thus continues. An even earlier instance of the Proto-JTK image (almost identical to the Mr. Mulholland image) was found posted 4th August 2005. \[9\] Perhaps it is the same image Mr. Mulholland based his image on. Interest in the verifiable (aka non-creepypasta, non-hearsay) search of the origin image has picked up in Japan. Perhaps all it takes is a veteran Japanese internet user to shed light on this image.

**False leads:**

There’s a creepypasta associated with JTK which of course is fanciful fiction and has no value in the search whatsoever.

A popular urban legend is that the picture came from a girl called Katy Robinson, who committed suicide because of cyberbullying. This has since been disproven as the alleged source image was another girl called Heather White. \[10\]

Many Japanese users recall seeing JTK from a late 2000s screamer video called “NNN Temporary Broadcast” (NNN臨時放送). The video ended with a jumpscare of JTK (but not Proto-JTK), so it has little value in the search. The video was a “recreation” of a creepy post where a user recalled watching a mysterious broadcast on TV - around 15 years ago - that listed the names of random citizens, who turned out dead the next morning. Fun (?) fact: He was probably misremembering the list of dead being announced after the 1985 JAL123 air disaster. \[11\]

220,DamnJackieICCTW,1641869642,"This story is one in a series I hope to do about mysterious deaths in and around Fort Bragg, North Carolina. I'm starting with Specialist Roman-Martinez's death because I find his case particularly infuriating.

   Specialist Roman-Martinez was 17 when he enlisted in the United States army in September of 2016. After basic and advanced training, he was stationed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina as a human resources specialist. According to his sister, Griselda, he joined the Army because he thought it would teach him discipline and responsibility.

   Specialist Roman-Martinez went missing in North Carolina sometime between May 22nd and 23rd in 2020. After he was reported missing, there was a ten-day search of the area in and around the Cape Lookout National Seashore. The search was called off on May 29th when his decapitated head was found with a “somewhat crescent-shaped, incised vs. chop wound” on the shore of Shackleford Banks Island, NC. His body has never been recovered. 

   During the Memorial Day weekend of 2020, Specialist Roman-Martinez traveled the four hours from Fort Bragg to the Cape Lookout National seashore with seven other soldiers- six men and one woman, all of whom remain unnamed. 

   There's very little information about what happened the night of the 22nd. The group made camp somewhere near marker 46 on South Core Banks, one  of the islands in the park. According to the group Specialist Roman-Martinez was with, they went to bed around midnight on the 22nd, and around that time they saw him walking away from the campsite wearing only blue shorts. When they got up around 8:30 the next morning  they realized Specialist Roman-Martinez was still gone. His phone, wallet, and desperately need glasses were left at the campsite. The group then spent most of the 23rd looking for him, eventually calling 911 sometime around 7:30 p.m.

   What information we know comes from the 911 call placed on the 23rd, and it's fairly garbled. The still unidentified caller claims that they've been looking for Specialist Roman-Martinez  all day, and that they were afraid he might of hurt himself because he had ""suicidal tendencies"". The caller further claims that they've been all over the island, looking for Park Rangers, before eventually reaching the ferry and realizing they needed to call 911. 

   Griselda, Specialist Roman-Martinez's sister, claims that he was not suicidal in the slightest, and that they had recently made plans for when Specialist Roman-Martinez got out of the Army. He was going to live with her, buy a new car, and take a long vacation in Japan. 

   In a statement by the Seashore's spokesman, a group of Park Rangers encountered the group early in the afternoon, asking them to move their vehicles away from some of the Parks sand dunes. The group made no mention of a missing person at that time. 

   US Army Criminal Investigation Command and the FBI spent months running down leads on this case, eventually upping the original reward for information from $25,000 to $50,000. They claimed that there was no evidence of drug use at the campsite on the night of the 22nd. 

   Specialist Roman-Martinez's family is desperate for information in this case. They have hired a Private Investigator. Because of Army CID policy they have never met with, or even know the names of, the soldiers who were with Specialist Roman-Martinez on the night of his disappearance. The case was switched to cold case status in November of 2021.

   On a last and totally anecdotal note, most of Fort Bragg was in Covid lockdown in May of 2020. I do not know for certain if Specialist Roman-Martinez 's unit was, or if his fellow campers were involved in his death. If they are innocent, some of that time spent avoiding calling police or even notifying their chain of command could have been because they were very aware they were going to get in a mountain of trouble for being so far from base against traveling regulations.

If you have any information on this case, contact Army CID at 910-396-8777.

221,pandacake71,1641866986,"Robert Durst was an eccentric millionaire most known for the documentary series ""The Jinx."" This documentary explored the three people in his life who had mysteriously disappeared/been murdered, including his first wife, a long-time friend, and his neighbor. During filming, he retreated to a bathroom, not realizing his mic was still on, and was caught saying,  ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."" 

His wife, Katherine, disappeared in 1982. Her body has never been found. Though many, including her family, believe Durst was responsible, he never revealed what happened to her or her remains.

In 2000, he then killed Susan Berman, his very close, long-time friend. The police had recently re-opened the investigation into Katherine's disappearance. Prosecutors alleged that Susan knew details about Katherine's disappearance that would incriminate Durst, so he killed her to shut her up. He was convicted of Susan's murder in September 2021 and [indicted on November 1, 2021](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/us/robert-durst-indicted-wife-murder-charge-new-york/index.html).

After her murder, Durst ran to Galveston, TX. There, he pretended to be a mute woman (??) and befriended his neighbor, Morris Black. He killed and dismembered Morris before dumping him in Galveston Bay. He claimed it was self-defense and was acquitted for the crime.

He was finally tried for Susan's murder in 2020, though COVID-19 delayed the trial until May 2021. He died in a prison hospital today, 1/10/22, at 6:44 a.m. due to natural causes.

Think of a brutal crime that has remained unsolved for over 70 years and the villages of Upper and Lower Quinton in Warwickshire will not immediately spring to mind. Both villages are about as rural and sleepy as any other village throughout the whole of England. 

Walton had lived and worked in Lower Quinton for his entire life and, despite his seniority and the onset of rheumatism, he continued light farm duties whenever possible. The popular and well-liked pensioner had his eccentric side but there were some people that regarded him with suspicions. In a village where everyone pretty much knew everyone else, all villagers knew that Walton had some quirks that set him aside from all others. 

The search was a quick one and Walton was found horribly murdered in a ditch. His trouncing hook was embedded in his throat. He was impaled to the ground by the pitchfork so strongly that it took attending police officers to remove it. A large crucifix had been carved into his chest and blood from this wound had soaked into the ground beneath him. 

Police revealed that during the early days of the investigation, they searched the same place and found nothing there.",UnresolvedMysteries,The Charles Walton Witchcraft Murder,0

For those unfamiliar with this guy, here's a link overview: [https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/israel-keyes](https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/israel-keyes)

I started listening to True Crime BS' podcast on Keyes (available on Spotify for those interested) and I'm falling down the rabbit hole of this killer.

I see very little mention of his potential to kill overseas. He mentions that being in the army limited him because they always had a watch on him. However, in recent years, there's been numerous videos and articles surfacing of military and government personnel committing horrific acts while stationed overseas.

Additionally, I would not be surprised if he had victims in Canada, particularly ones that may be associated with the Highway of Tears in BC.

I'm curious to see what other true crime enthusiasts may think. Aside from some of the already discussed potential victims (i.e. Maura Murray is a popular one), are they any others that have come to light in more recent years that you think might have been a Keyes victim, domestic or international? thanks",UnresolvedMysteries,The Unknown Victims of Israel Keyes,0
225,mysteryconfidential,1641852968,"An unknown dead body on an Adelaide Beach in post-war Australia. 

In 1948 an unknown nameless man washed up on Somerton Park Beach in Adelaide, Australia. The man has never been identified and to this day, the country scratches its head. However; a trail of breadcrumbs has led to the discovery of the man’s possible descendants all the way down to the man’s (potential) great-grandkids living today in Australia.

On the 1st December 1948 at 6.30 am — the police were contacted after the body of a man was found in Somerton Park (about seven miles from the nearest major city Adelaide). The dead body of the man was found lying with his head resting against the seawall with legs extended and the feet crossed. The two boys that found him were out horse riding and initially thought that the man was sleeping or drunk. An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat.

The man also had with him an unused train ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach. He had in his possession an empty packet of Juicy Fruit, a comb manufactured in America, an Army Club (British cigarettes) cigarette packet, and a box of matches.

The pathologist said that the man had a “Britisher” appearance, was aged about 40–45, and was in extremely good physical condition;

“180 centimetres (5 ft 11 in) tall, with grey eyes, fair to ginger-coloured hair, slightly grey around the temples, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, hands and nails that showed no signs of manual labour, big and little toes that met in a wedge shape, like those of a dancer or someone who wore boots with pointed toes; and pronounced high calf muscles consistent with people who regularly wore boots or shoes with high heels or performed ballet.”

The fantastic physique and intensity of calf muscles led some investigators to believe that the man must have been a ballet dancer of some sort or perhaps soccer?

The man was clean-shaven, wearing a double-breasted jacket and suit with “American” tailoring. The clothes that the Somerton Man wore had the labels removed. And his belongings, as well as the ethnic look of the man, suggested that he could have been Australian, European, or potentially American. South Australian police put out an urgent bulletin and many people came to view the body. And nobody local could identify the man. 

The Somerton Man’s last meal was a pasty eaten four hours before death. There were no foreign agents in the man’s body, however, the suggestion was that the internal bleeding and over-enlarged spleen could indicate untraced poisoning. No trace of poison was found but there was intense strain found on some of his organs — including the heart. 

The Somerton Man was embalmed, a death mask was created and he was promptly buried. The local residents generously paid for a headstone and funeral plot so that the man could be buried with a dignified memorial.

Months later the case’s most iconic clue was discovered. A tiny piece of rolled-up paper with the words Tamám Shud was discovered within the Somerton Man’s pockets. The words were not handwritten but instead were printed. A local library official and well-read local linked the pages to the last page of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.

Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a Persian book of poetry attributed to the Persian wordsmith Omar Khayyam and the words Tamám Shud were said to mean THE END (or ended).

The search for the book brought the police to a 1941 edition of the book (a Christchurch, New Zealand publication). The book indeed had the last page ripped out with the words Tamám Shud missing. On the last page, there was a faint indentation representing five lines of text, in capital letters — with possible encryption.

Even the Naval Intelligence could not crack this code. It remains unsolved as a riddle (or perhaps gibberish). 

A phone number was written at the back of the book. This number led investigators to a local nurse who lived within Adelaide. When the nurse in question was shown the death mask, she was said to have been near hysteria at seeing the man and close to fainting and yet, she immediately denied knowing the deceased. She was evasive and refused to talk to investigators about the Somerton Man.

Police did not keep records of the witness nor her details and this hampered the investigation for the next 50 years. Her identity was not revealed at the time and the Australian Police force threw out her name and address (only keeping hold of the telephone number). 

That is until over 50 years later Detective Gerry Feltus matched the telephone number written on the back of the book to a 1947 South Australian telephone directory (which the man had been trawling through every single day since picking up the cold case with the intention of linking the numbers).

This led police back to Jo Thomson — some 50 years after initial contact. Jo Thomson was continually evasive about the case, did not want to discuss the man, and did not let up about her connection to the found body, and to the day she died, she maintained her radio silence on the matter. 

Jo Thomson had a son named Robin Thomson but unfortunately, Robin died before Feltus could interview him. Robin was a former ballet dancer with the same physical attributes as the Somerton Man including the distinguishable dancer’s calves that the mysterious Somerton Man had. Robin had the same genetic form of earlobes as the Somerton Man (lobe connected to the skin). This is a common connection in genetic ancestry, along with sharing their powerful calves and love of dance. 

Professor Derek Abbottlater became engrossed in the case and would eventually locate Rachel Egan (Robin Thomson’s biological daughter and possibly the Somerton Man’s granddaughter). 

The involvement of Mr. Abbott and Rachel Egan would soon turn romantic and they would end up marrying each other and having kids. Professor Abbott had become obsessed with solving the riddle and would draw to more scientific and forensic methods than those used in 1948–49.

Abbott consulted dental experts that concluded that the Somerton Man had hypodontia (a rare genetic disorder) and photographic evidence presented also showed that Robin Thomson had the same condition. Thus bringing the chance of a coincidence on this genetic connection as between one in 10,000,000 and one in 20,000,000. Abbott now fathers the possible great-grandchildren of the Somerton Man.

So Who Was The Somerton Man?

In establishing a potential genetic link all the way down to the man’s grandchildren, there is optimistic progress in this mystery. There is a direct link between the Somerton Man and the only found witness, the elusive Jo Thomson, and in 2021 DNA analysis was underway to find the definitive forensic links for the Somerton Man. 

However; why was the man on the beach that day and what killed him? 

This may never get an answer. 

The most rampant theory is that the Somerton Man was a spy that knew too much. The death was unusual — there was no direct evidence of foul play but the lack of evidential poisoning could be an espionage trick (think of some of the recent types of spy-related murders from ricin to nerve agents). But why would a spy be lurking in the Australian suburbs? And why would an assassin be on his tail? The man clearly had a cosmopolitan aura — he couldn’t be identified, he carried American products, British products, Persian texts taken from a Kiwi library book. But beyond the spy out in the cold theory. It plays out perfectly against the Cold War era. 

Or perhaps he was a drunk that fell asleep down on the beach… 

There’s very little else to go on in terms of murder motives… 

What do you think?

226,moondog151,1641850357,"On August 6, 2004, 49-year-old Rajesh Dhayam abruptly went missing. Rajesh was an Administrative Assistant at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute in Moka, Mauritius. He was the father of two children with his daughter studying abroad in Australia and lived separated from his wife. He was described as a very reserved man who made no attempts at socializing with his neighbours one of them even stating that he never had a single conversation with him in the two years that he had lived in the neighbourhood.

His landlord Seewan Leelodharry also told police that he had rarely ever seen Rajesh but that he would always deliver on his payments and rent however on one of the few times that he did get to see him Rajesh told him that he was planning on going on a trip to the French island of Réunion. It's was speculated that he had possibly been planning on going on that trip with a young woman named Crithika Nundkumar with who he had been having an affair for quite some time and many residents reported seeing Crithika in the neighbourhood and Rajesh likewise often spent time at her home.

Rajesh was last seen leaving a function at the Indira Gandhi Centre in Vacoas-Phoenix and according to his brother on the day of his disappearance he was carrying a check for 350 000 Mauritian rupees which he had recently deposited from his bank accounts and had just obtained a loan for the purchase of a car. The police searched Rajesh's home and when they found a picture of Crithika Nundkumar they decided that the rumours of an affair had some degree of truth to them and decided to go to Crithika's home to see if Rajesh by any chance happened to be there.

On August 27 the police approached Crithika's home on Béchard Lane in St. Paul. When they arrived, however, the main gate was chained shut and padlocked and once the police broke the locks they approached the home and every door and entrance was locked shut and the blinds and curtains closed so no one could peek inside. Despite this, an officer managed to peer inside the house via a small window and saw what looked to be a body. The police in response broke down the front door and entered the house finding themselves in the living room.

Upon entering the home the very first thing they noticed was the body of 37-year-old Crithika Nundkumar laying on a mattress the police however were not expecting what came next. When they searched the house they discovered a further nine corpses including Rajesh Dhayam. Three of the corpses were found on the first floor and the remaining seven were found upstairs. They were also found in different rooms of the house.

Two of the bodies were Crithika Nundkumar and Rajesh Dhayam but the others belonged to Crithika's son 10-year-old Devesh Nundkumar, her 65-year-old mother Kuntee Mawooa, her siblings 35-year-old graphic designer Chitra Debi Mawooa and 36-year-old Ravi Mawooa. Amongst the bodies were also those belonging to another family who had been friends with Crithika's family with the police discovered the corpses of 40-year-old Mala Devi Jhowry, 17-year-old Yogini Jhowry and a 15-year-old named Bhavish. However the tenth corpse the police did not recognize and were unable to immediately identify. The police were unable to keep quiet about this discovery and it soon dominated the Mauritian press with many flocking to Béchard Lane as to watch the bodies removed with some of those removing them wearing gas masks. The Prime Minister of Mauritius Paul Bérenger even responded to this incident stating ""I offer my sympathies to all those afflicted by this tragedy"" Ravi also requested a 15-day leave from his job due to health reasons which were accepted. His employer was unable to contact him afterwards

The bodies were all found to be in an advanced state of decomposition having been dead for quite some time. When searching the house the police recovered two medallions bearing the initials ""EK"". The medallions belonged to Crithika and Rajesh. Police believed that EK referred to Eckankar a religious sect and non-profit organization and that this could be the result of a mass suicide with religious motivations. Furthermore strengthening this theory was how an autopsy on the ten corpses determined that the cause of death for all of them was cyanide poisoning and that no signs of violence or trauma were observed. The coroner also determined that Crithika was the last of the ten to die and had a glass of cyanide next to her, He came to this conclusion based on the decomposition with her corpse being less decayed than the other nine. Meanwhile, the unidentified body appeared to have been the first to pass and that they had been dead for around 10 - 15 days with the coroner estimating that they all died on August 20. Jean Maunick the leader and founder of the Mauritian sect of Eckankar publicly denied any involvement but admitted that Rajesh had been a member of the sect but he left in 1996 and Jean further stated that he didn't know about the nine other dead. Although the police continued to believe that this was a mass suicide they were unable to link it to Eckankar. The police also took samples from the water tank and anywhere else water was stored just in case it was an accidental poisoning.

Another strange thing noticed is that the deceased all deposited money from their bank accounts like Rajesh Dhayam did on the day of his disappearance.

One of the strongest pieces of evidence in favour of the mass suicide was a 14-page note that the police found believed to be written by Crithika. An excerpt from the note goes as follows "" I do not know what is married life… I have a son and I have always to look for money for him… I put an end to my life and the nine persons who have followed me and who have suffered like me.."" The note further went into her financial issues and how no one would lend her any money and that she had even tried resorting to prostitution. The wording of the note in its entirety was quite vague and it wasn't clear whether it was referring to a mass suicide or if it was mass poisoning with Crithika killing herself afterwards.

Meanwhile, the police tried solving the mystery of the unidentified 10th corpse however this avenue of investigation would lead to more questions than answers. The body belonged to a man around 50 years of age and next to his body was a backpack containing two identification cards and a ring with the initials ""HJ"". The identification cards however despite having the same photograph and face both had different names the first being Hervé Janvier and the other bearing the name Mr. Labonté. Hervé had been a wanted man since November 2002, after he escaped from prison. Hervé's body was identified by his wife via his clothing and jewelry but due to the advanced decomposition positive identification was made impossible and the police theorized that his death could've been faked. Hervé and his accomplice Antoine Chetty were both convicted for fraud and the illegal sale of land and properties. Antoine had stated that he didn't believe Hervé would commit suicide stating that he was too intelligent to do so. Furthermore, Hervé was considered by police to be a master of disguise who had used several fake names and alias to throw the police off. A resident also reported sighting him on a beach in the days before the discovery of the bodies which would complicate matters considerably due to the rate of decomposition. Hervé also had no link to the other bodies and the room he was found in was locked from the outside. Also when looking into the second ID that of Mr. Labonté the police were unable to find any missing person reports by that name. Eventually, the testimony and identification by Hervé's wife was deemed unreliable and the officially the 10th corpse remains unidentified.

The police arrested two people possibly involved. The two are a policeman named Bhupendra Auckraj and a homeless man Jeetendra Janghee they were arrested for forgery and fraud as found inside the home were plots of land fraudulently sold to one of the victims under the alias of Franck Marion. It seems that despite this however they had nothing to do with the actual deaths of the 10 individuals and were simply charged with fraud. I am however unable to find a follow up and any information on their possible trials.

The police looked into the backgrounds of the other victims with Mala Jhowry before her death having reported to the police that she was leaving her husband due to conflicts and taking herself and their two children to their grandmother, This happened on July 22. Her husband was briefly questioned and he was baffled by this turn of events denying that there had ever been any issues in their marriage that would cause something like this and when the police contacted Mala's mother they learned that she and her children never showed up. Mala and Crithika had both met at a salon and soon became business partners. Mala's husband doesn't believe that their two children would commit suicide

Meanwhile, the police continued to examine the home and determined that no one had left the house as combined with every entrance and exit being locked and the keys to the house found inside and no signs of forced entry were noted such as broken windows or signs of any damage to the locks. Meanwhile, with the exception of the ten decomposing corpses, the house was remarkably tidy. Everything was in its proper place, neat and all the kitchen utensils were clean.

The police also wondered how the relatives of the victims never reported them as missing. This however is one of the few questions that would be answered. The neighbours on Béchard Lane stated that they weren't concerned over the absence of the residents of the home as they were also not very outgoing and they rarely saw them, to begin with. As for their surviving relatives, they told the police that they were contacted by them and stated that they planned on going on a trip to the Mauritian island of Rodrigues and thus they didn't report them missing because they thought they knew where they were. According to reports, Mala's husband did head over to Béchard Lane on three separate occasions but after being stopped by the locked gate he decided to just go home unaware that the bodies of his wife and two children were lying dead inside that house.

Rajesh Dhayam was the only one of the dead to have his disappearance reported to the police and there was a little controversy regarding it as his relatives told the police that he may be staying at Béchard Lane and on August 17, the police accompanied some of his relatives to the home but the police at the time did not deem it fit to break down the door and enter the home. Since the coroner estimated that the time of death was August 20, it's was, therefore, possible that on that day Rajesh may have still been alive and thus Rajesh's family were considering suing the police for not entering the home which could've possibly saved Rajesh's life. They however decided against this likely due to August 20, being the date of death was simply just an estimate and not a confirmed fact.

There were two surviving members of Crithika's family however with her sister Rumila being one of them and Rumila tragically had lost her entire family as a result of this incident save for her children and husband. She said that Crithika was a strange woman even when she was young. Crithika as a child would often predict when visitors mainly relatives would arrive at their home to visit and she was correct about these predictions a fair number of times. Before this incident, Crithika would call Rumila and told her in Creole ""One day you will hear..in history..what types of great works your sister has accomplished. I always told you I am a goddess, no one believed me. I am going very far, forget that you have a sister named Critika. Critika said strange things like ""if I cry, it will rain"" or ""God talks to me"" She also stated that she had a strange vibe and that people would behave differently around her. Rumila doesn't believe that this was a mass suicide and stated that she believed an 11th person is involved.

Ravi Mawooa one of the dead and Critika's brothers also made some strange statements in the days leading up to his death. He said to one of his relatives ""We are following a meditation course which will help us elevate ourselves. People beneath us are demons"" and called his wife who was residing at her mother's due to pregnancy and told her not to contact him for the next 15 days as he'd be in ""deep meditation"". His neighbours reported that before his disappearance he appeared normal and went to work every day.

Ashok Nundkoomar who was the ex-husband of Critika was also interviewed and he described Critika as ""manipulative"" ""authoritarian"" and ""demanding"" They both met in college and married a few years later. After a failed pregnancy the couple tried again and Critika gave birth to Devesh in 1993 or 1994. She often complained about abdominal pain and occasionally suffer from a swollen face. Ashok testified that she would visit several doctors but they were unable to provide effective treatment. One day she ended up buying a Crystal Ball and brought it home with her and this was when their marriage began to deteriorate. It was around this time that Critika started to involve herself in religious rites and sects. She said that meditation with the Crystal Ball helped with her pain and enabled her to talk to god. She would frequently isolate herself in that room with the ball and refused to let anyone enter while she was inside and would sometimes wake up at 3:00 AM to go to that room to meditate much to Ashok's annoyance. Eventually, Ashok found the key to that specific room and locked it. Not long after Critika left with Devesh to go live with her mother telling Ashok ""this house is not made for me"" Critika was also the leader of a Hindu prayer group. Ashok stated that he was certain that Critika had written that suicide note but was at a loss to explain who Critika brought her son into the mass suicide plot. His son Devesh was last seen on August 16 where he was spotted riding a bike.

It was believed that her controlling behaviour may have come from her father Deoduth who Rumila described as abusive and distant. He was very controlling over his family including his wife and children with Rumila and Critika often called him ""The Dictator"" or even ""Hitler""

The police also speculated that Mala and Critika were having an affair and in a secret relationship. People who knew the two stated that they appeared to be more than just friends and Mala would often praise Critika and talk about her frequently. Furthermore, in the suicide note, Mala is referred to as ""Princess"" or ""Honey"" and stated that she had become disillusioned with Rajesh. Mala's husband stated that he didn't believe they were in a romantic or sexual relationship but felt that their friendship might've been controlling or abusive as Mala would try and hide her communications with Critika. The day Mala abruptly left her husband and informed the police that she was moving in with her mother happened on a day when her husband wasn't home.

The relatives and neighbours all testified and gave statements to a magistrate in private and a report was sent to the prosecution however the report was never made public and despite the massive nature of the case the police simply ran out of leads and were unable to investigate further.

The two main theories are that the case is either a mass murder committed by Critka who promptly took her own life or it was a case of mass suicide. Although the true version of events is unknown.

Adding to the mystery is how the identity of the tenth corpse has never been accurately determined leaving him unidentified and thus an oddity amongst the mass suicide or murder of two families.

Not only that but all the money that had been withdrawn by the dead before the suicide has never been found and the police don't know why it was withdrawn.

She made me a better person she made life feel full and complete.   Liz was the most positive person you’d ever meet, I wasn’t as positive I often felt like giving up on getting my dream job I thought I was going to be stuck working at the Manhattan forever, her words were “never give up on your dreams” I didn’t and In November 1994 I got my dream job! She was so happy for me she got to see me have my dream come true I never got to see her get hers. She only got 22 short years here but she lived her life to the fullest, she tried so hard for everything she ever wanted. She truly loved life. I’ve never met anyone who genuinely loved life like she did. She never gave up on her dreams. She never gave up on me she was always there for me. My life fell apart when she vanished my best friend I ever had gone.. even 27 years later I still can’t forget her gorgeous face, those years were some of the best in my life the memories we had will stick with me forever.

Liz and I never ever broke a promise.. but one.. the one where we’d be there to see each other get our dream jobs and have a family. Joking we’d be Aunty liz and Aunty ash. Always be there for each other no matter what. That was a promise I never intended to break a promise that meant everything. Unfortunately life was so cruel as to take that promise away from us. Liz May be gone but I’m not and for as long as I live my goal is to bring her home. I’ll never give up on her. It’s the least I can do. She made my life better she was my non blooded sister. And her parents were the kindest people you’d ever meet, to meeting them with Liz introducing me to them for the first time to seeing them cry as their daughters accused killer walks free. That was the last time I’d ever see them their devastated faces forever ingrained in my mind. The Membrey’s are a gorgeous family a family that was like my extended family. I’ve always felt guilty I got live my life and she didn’t. That guilt I still have even after all theses years. If you have someone like liz in your life you’ll understand just how much they mean.  After 27 years it’s long enough I’m begging I’m praying I’m asking for someone anyone to come forward.   I’m here appealing for anyone to come forward with information on her disappearance.

230,TheKrystalSkye24x,1641837263,"I have recently watched the documentary on netflix and would like to add my thoughts onto this thread. I have been researching for hours on reddit and noone else (to my knowledge) has come up with the theory I have established. 

I would first like to state that I am currently in my 2nd year of mental health nursing so do have some knowledge to back up my thoughts around Mr Bailey.

To start, I truly beleive that Mr Bailey suffers from a mental illness. His behaviour meets someone who may have a split personality disorder or something similar. I beleive he may have autistic traits also.  Baileys disorder may be triggered (or heightened) through consuming alcohol. This could also be related to his aggression towards his former partner when under the influence. He simply loses control of himself but when sober seems to talk about himself as another person/third person. I do not beleive Bailey committed the murder but I do beleive he was involved (hence why he had scratches on his arms, tried to get rid of his clothes/wash them etc) and had knowledge of the murder as well as knowing other details. I think in a way, he liked the attention from saying he did the crime when under the influence but then when sober rejects all knowledge. If he didn't do the crime, then only someone who knew the killer or was involved with the crime would know alot of the details he did, act the way he did and have the physical marks. 

I beleive the suspect may actually be closer to home for Sophie. My theory is that it was actually Alfie Lyons - the house next to Sophies. 

It was well known that Sophie and Alfie had regular disputes. There Is a lot we don't know about Sophie in general. She was quite a private person when in Ireland. There could be a lot of missing information regarding Sophie, the quarrels with neighbours etc. 

The fact that Sophie ran away from her house and not towards Alfies is odd. If I felt I was in danger then I would run to my neighbour. Not down a long country track that is miles long heading to nowhere. I have looked on Google maps and the main road was a long long walk away. The only reason to not run to your neighbour is that it's because they are the ones attacking you or you feel they wouldn't help you in such a situation due to their disliking to you. They also knocked on her back door, not front. The backdoor joins onto the drive of Alfies house.

Bailey previously on that evening (I beleive) had driven near Sophies and stated that he felt something bad was going to happen there. Maybe Bailey and Alfie were closer than we know and Alfie had told Bailey in conversation that he was going to confront Sophie that night (maybe over the disputes or something else we don't know) and maybe Bailey knew a different side to Alfie. Maybe Alfie had aggressive tendencies just like Bailey did - maybe they saw eye to eye in this aspect and got on well from it. 

I beleive that Alfie committed the murder... a heated conversation gone wrong or something that went too far. The fact that the murder was SO unusally aggressive is a red flag for me. This person was absolutely intent on killing Sophie. A lot of murders will go down the route of strangulation and leave it at that. Sophies head was bashed in with a concrete block and her skull was exposed at the crime scene. Aswell as severe breakages to her upper body. I beleive the concrete block was used several times to omit this damage. The killer definitely wanted her dead and definitely had a lot of aggression released during this killing. Was there things we didn't know about Sophie that would enlighten such rage in someone? A nice good looking French girl in the Irish countryside does not just have her skull bashed in with a concrete block for no reason. 

I believe Alfie committed it and maybe confided in Bailey shortly after. I beleive Bailey came to the scene to help Alfie clean up any evidence (possibly) and maybe discuss about what will happen next, what time to report the body etc etc . Bailey was an educated man and I think Alfie would confide in someone like that for help and advice. This would explain why Bailey would still want to get rid of clothing items etc etc as he would have been in touch with the crime scene. Alfie was reported to have a bandage on his hand from a dog bite but this could of been related to the murder. 

I find it odd that there is no photos of Alfie, no interview shown on the documentary despite them living right beside Sophies house. We truly don't know who this man is, his intentions, his behaviour, his history, or what he was capable of. Sometimes murders are alot closer to home than we think. 

Bailey with his personality and possible mental illness flourished off this drama.. something happening in the area for him to write about. His personality is the type to get overly fixated on things. He is clearly an overimaginative person with a creative mind - in certain states he might have convinced even himself that he had done it - hence his strange outbursts. 

I think that the killer knew they would get away with it due to how rural the area is, the police were not used to things like this, they probably knew that Sophie kept herself private so gaining information would be difficult from others. They were able to kill her with what was around them leaving little to no evidence. Also probably aware that DNA / blood testing was limited at this time. 

I think there is a lot of missing information and the fact the police were quite laid back with the investigation doesn't help. Were they paid off by someone wealthy? In rural areas like this, it wouldn't surprise me if police would take a bribe and just blame it all on the known crazy village man - Bailey.

Recently Bailey has come out and said he thinks the killer is dead. This would rise true to my theory as Alfie is indeed dead now.

232,Texas_Monthly,1641832944,"The mysterious disappearance and death of Canadian, Texas, high schooler Tom Brown was the subject of our podcast series, Tom Brown's Body, which premiered in 2020. 

To recap: 

In 2016, the popular teenager disappeared in the tiny Panhandle community of Canadian, Texas. Two years later, his remains were discovered beneath a tree outside of town. But to this day, no arrests have been made, and nearly everyone involved in the case has fallen under suspicion, including the local sheriff and the boy's family. In the final episode, we learned that a grand jury would be convened to hear testimony about Tom's death. 

Now, a ninth episode from host Skip Hollandsworth reveals new information on the case from private investigator Philip Klein, a new witness, and lead investigator Rachel Kading.

233,bizzbuzzbizzbuzz,1641832282,"On August 27, 2006, 2 year-old [Trenton Duckett](https://imgur.com/52S1jpB) disappeared without a trace from his bedroom in Leesburg, Florida. Trenton’s mother, 21 year-old [Melinda Duckett](https://imgur.com/Or307Zk), told police that she put Trenton to bed around 7:00 pm that evening, and, when she went into his room to check on him a couple of hours later, her son was missing and the screen to his bedroom window in their ground-floor apartment had been cut. 

Melinda quickly became the prime suspect in her son's disappearance, but no physical evidence has ever linked her to the crime. Prior to his disappearance, Trenton's life had been one marked by upheaval and turbulence, and the sheer amount of rumors, accusations, and lack of evidence make this case a particularly frustrating one.

It’s been over 15 years since that night, and no trace of Trenton Duckett has ever been found. 

**A Turbulent Relationship**

Trenton was born on August 10, 2004 to Melinda Duckett (neé Eubank) and [Joshua Duckett](https://imgur.com/UBitNT4). Melinda moved to Florida when she was 17 years-old to live with her adoptive grandparents, who resided in [The Villages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Villages,_Florida). Melinda was born in South Korea and adopted by American parents when she was four months old, and she spent most of her childhood in Lockport, New York, just a few miles from the Canadian border.

Melinda met Josh Duckett shortly after moving to Florida. They started dating when they were both [students at South Sumter High School](https://imgur.com/FHpD5HK); Melinda got pregnant while they were still in high school, and Trenton was born shortly after they graduated. Their relationship was incredibly volatile, and the two broke up in April 2005. Soon after Josh moved out, he contacted the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), alleging that Melinda threatened to harm Trenton unless Josh came over to her house to talk to her. DCF investigated these claims, but found no evidence of them, and Trenton remained in his mother's care.

At the end of the month, Josh and his mother had Melinda [Baker Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Act)ed, an action that immediately removed Trenton from Melinda’s care and placed in his father’s custody. It was later determined that Josh and his mother had knowingly manipulated the Bushnell, Florida police chief (a friend of their family) into approving the Baker Act by having Josh call Melinda on speakerphone while in the presence of the police chief. At one point in the conversation, Melinda used the phrase “end it,” which Josh and his mother claimed was a threat of suicide. The police chief admitted that Melinda didn’t specify what she wanted to end or how she would end it, but she still approved the use of the Baker Act against Melinda to have her involuntarily committed. Melinda had to undergo multiple psychiatric evaluations, but was released as psychiatrists found no evidence that she was a threat to herself or anyone else.

Melinda and Josh (alongside his mother) battled for custody of Trenton throughout May 2005, with Melinda completing court-ordered case plans, and Josh again alleging that Melinda threatened to harm Trenton (as with the previous allegations, DCF could not verify these claims). Then, in June 2005, Josh signed an [affidavit](https://imgur.com/w0cwRKb) stating that the allegations he previously made against Melinda were false and were made at the urging of his mother, who wanted custody of Trenton. Josh also stated that he believed Melinda should be given full custody of Trenton. The next month, July 2005, Melinda and Josh suddenly eloped. In August 2005, Josh attempted to file a restraining order against his mother on the basis of harassment and bullying.

For a couple of months, things seemed to stabilize between Josh and Melinda. And then, on October 30, 2005, the two got into an argument. Josh also alleged that, during this argument, Melinda held a knife to Trenton and threatened to kill him (Melinda again denied these claims). DCF performed a home study and, though they did not find any evidence that Trenton had been threatened or physically harmed, removed Trenton from his parents’ care due to the continued volatility of his parents’ relationship, which DCF felt could result in harm to Trenton. He was placed in foster care and then, a few days later, temporary custody was granted to Melinda’s grandparents.

In November 2005, both Josh and Melinda were court-ordered to complete DCF case plans and undergo psychological evaluations in order to regain custody of Trenton. Melinda completed the case plan (including parenting classes) and underwent and passed all the psych evals; Josh, meanwhile, did not complete the case plan, abandoned the parenting classes, and also violated a court order. Because of this, in November 2005, Melinda was awarded custody of Trenton while Josh was granted unsupervised visitations with his son. DCF continued their observations of Trenton throughout the beginning of 2006, eventually closing the case and recommending that Melinda retain custody of Trenton with Josh allowed unsupervised visitation. In June 2006, Melinda filed for divorce from Josh.

On July 3, 2006, Melinda contacted law enforcement and said that Josh had sent her a [MySpace message](https://imgur.com/7asjjfe) that threatened to kill both her and Trenton. Melinda used this message to file a temporary restraining order against Josh on July 5. Josh denied writing the message and claimed that Melinda had access to his MySpace login and password; as of November 2006, police believe that the message likely was written by Melinda, not Josh.

**Trenton’s Disappearance**

On the evening of Sunday, August 27, 2006, Melinda claimed that she put Trenton to bed in his room in their apartment in Windemere Villas. She then invited two friends over to watch a movie; when she went to check on Trenton after the movie was over, he was gone. One of Melinda’s friends called 911 around 9:00 pm, and Melinda spoke to dispatchers, telling them that her son was missing.

When the police arrived at 9:19 pm, they found that Trenton was missing and that the screen to his bedroom window had been slashed, but not much else. Forensic examinations of the slashed window screen from Trenton’s bedroom were inconclusive. Investigators could not determine if the screen had been slashed from inside or outside the room, and they could also not identify the object that made the cut. 

When speaking to police, Melinda implied to police that she felt her estranged husband, Josh, might have been responsible for Trenton’s disappearance, but authorities found no evidence that this was the case. Josh took a polygraph test, which he passed; Melinda failed a voice stress test and refused to take a polygraph on the advice of her lawyer. Suspicion quickly turned to Melinda, the last person to see Trenton alive. The last confirmed sighting of Trenton Duckett by anyone other than his mother occurred the day before he went missing, on Saturday, August 26 at about 4:00 pm when Melinda picked him up from her grandparents' house. Police worked to determine the whereabouts of both Melinda and Trenton after she picked him up from her grandparents’ house in the hopes that this could provide some clues about what happened to Trenton, but they have been able to confirm very little about where Melinda and Trenton were from 4:00 pm on Saturday until 7:00 pm on Sunday.

According to Melinda, on Sunday, August 27, she wanted to shoot target practice with a 20-gauge shotgun she had recently purchased. So she decided to take Trenton and the gun to a shooting range near Farles Lake in the Ocala National Forest. Except, Melinda said, she got lost, and she and Trenton never actually made it to the forest. Instead, she said, she and Trenton spent hours driving around Central Florida, stopping at both the TD Waterhouse Center (now called the Amway Center) in downtown Orlando and the Altamonte Mall in Altamonte Springs. Police checked video surveillance in both of these locations, but were unable to find any evidence that Melinda and Trenton were there on August 27.

**The Prime Suspect**

Melinda quickly became the prime suspect in the case, but she vehemently denied any involvement in Trenton’s disappearance. On September 7, 2006, just over a week after Trenton went missing, Nancy Grace invited Melinda to be interviewed on her TV show. During the interview, Grace strongly insinuated that Melinda had killed Trenton, badgering her with questions about Trenton’s disappearance, and accusing her of hiding something. Grace also pointed to Melinda’s refusal to take a lie detector test as proof of her guilt.

Then, on September 8, 2006, 13 days after Trenton went missing and the day the *Nancy Grace* episode was slated to air, Melinda died by suicide, shooting herself in the closet of her grandparents’ home with her grandfather’s shotgun. Melinda left three separate suicide notes: one addressed to her [parents](https://imgur.com/lgbcWYk), one to her grandparents ([page 1](https://imgur.com/gy7bhB4), [page 2](https://imgur.com/3XynQsA)), and one to the public ([page 1](https://imgur.com/CSkilco), [page 2](https://imgur.com/45ghcge)).

Melinda’s family sued Nancy Grace, arguing that Grace had badgered Melinda, a grieving young mother in the midst of unbelievable stress, into ending her own life. Grace argued that she held no responsibility for Melinda’s death and it was more likely Melinda killed herself over the guilt of killing Trenton. The case was eventually settled out of court, with CNN agreeing to make a $200,000 payment to establish the Trenton Duckett Trust with the money being used to fund additional searches for Trenton. (Melinda was not the only Nancy Grace guest who committed suicide after being blamed for killing her child. In 2012, Grace demanded that a woman who had charged with manslaughter after drinking vodka and rolling over on her sleeping baby be charged with murder; this woman, Toni Medrano, also died by suicide a few days after Nancy Grace segment aired.)

About a week after Melinda’s suicide, police issued a statement identifying her as the primary suspect in Trenton’s disappearance. However, they also stated that they didn’t believe that Melinda had harmed Trenton. Authorities also said that they had enough evidence to arrest Melinda only four days after her son went missing, but that they held off on arresting her in the hopes that she would lead them to Trenton. Police later revealed the arrest warrant they were going to issue was for charges unrelated to Trenton’s disappearance. In fact, in 2011, Leesburg Police Detective Brian Cash stated that, “There's just no evidence. Some will argue that he was killed. Some will argue that he was maybe handed off. When I look at the case, I see a missing kid with no real good explanation to what happened to him.”

**Evidence, Leads, and Sightings**

Despite Melinda’s claims that she and Trenton never made it to the Ocala National Forest, there were a couple of alleged sightings of Melinda and Trenton in the forest on August 27. While none of these sightings were confirmed, police believed they were credible enough to begin searching areas of the forest. But despite numerous searches of the forest, including both the Farles Lake area and another area where there was an alleged sighting of Melinda and Trenton, no trace of Trenton has been found.

There was another lead that investigators found credible enough to investigate and release to the public: a construction worker claimed he saw a well-dressed Asian or Hispanic couple in their late 50s or early 60s, driving a silver or light gold Cadillac Escalade, possibly with New York plates, talking to Melinda and Trenton at a construction site on Aug. 17, ten days before Trenton went missing. The witness also stated there was a black or blue-colored bag on the hood of Melinda’s car. The NY plates were especially interesting to police, since Melinda’s parents still resided in NY. The construction site was located on US 27, near an entrance to the Florida Turnpike. Police dug up the construction site after Trenton disappeared, but nothing related to Trenton’s disappearance was found. Melinda’s parents told police they did not know any couples who matched the description and did not know anyone who drove a silver or gold Escalade.

In September 2006, a witness came forward who claimed to have seen Melinda and Trenton at a Wendy’s restaurant in Belleview, Florida the day he disappeared (Belleview is located between Leesburg and Ocala). According to the witness (who worked at the Wendy’s), Melinda and Trenton went through the drive thru at about 11:30am that morning; Melinda allegedly returned about 30 minutes later without Trenton. There was another possible sighting of Melinda later that day at the restaurant at around 4:00 pm. As with the other sightings, none of these have been confirmed.

Police *were* able to confirm (using credit card and ATM records) two locations that Melinda visited between 4:00 pm August 26 and 7:00 pm August 27  – she purchased gas at a BP station just south of Leesburg around 5:25 pm on August 26, and withdrew $40 from an ATM in Leesburg at 10:50 am on August 27. It is unknown if Trenton was with her at either location, and while police have numerous alleged sightings (some of just Melinda, some of Melinda and Trenton together), none have been confirmed.

Police also released records that showed that Melinda’s cell pinged off towers in various places in Central Florida between noon and 4:00 pm on Sunday, August 27. Unfortunately, using these kinds of pings to identify the exact location of where a call was made is not reliable evidence (using pings isn’t the same as using GPS data linked to a smartphone, which can give exact locations). For example, the first call Melinda made (at 12:08 pm) pinged off a tower near the Paddock Mall in Ocala, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that Melinda was at or in the immediate vicinity of the Paddock Mall at that time. In fact, all of the calls pinged towers located between Ocala and Orlando, so it’s possible that these towers could have been pinged if Melinda was indeed, as she claimed, driving around Central Florida that day. (More information about the faulty science of using cell phone ping data to pinpoint a person’s exact location can be found in [this article.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-your-cell-phone-cant-tell-the-police))

One of the major issues with this case is that there is no actual physical evidence of what happened to Trenton. The police did find that the window screen in Trenton’s bedroom had been cut, but they were not able to determine if it had been cut from the inside or outside of the apartment. The police were able to determine that the MySpace message Melinda claimed Josh sent to her threatening to kill both her and Trenton wasn’t written by Josh–and they believed it may indeed have written by Melinda herself–but even that isn’t evidence that she did anything to Trenton (especially given the history of Josh and Melinda falsely accusing each other of abusive/threatening behavior).

The most damning evidence against Melinda (in addition to having been the last person to see Trenton alive) is that, the day after she reported Trenton missing, police found some of Trenton’s toys, baby pictures, and a sonogram image in a trash bin at Melinda’s apartment complex. Police say that these findings are what made them originally take a closer look at Melinda; however, it was not able to be proven that these items were put into the garbage by Melinda. Additionally, searches of Melinda’s apartment also found the she had numerous keepsakes and photos of Trenton in the home, and his room remained filled with toys and clothes after he went missing.

**So Where is Trenton?**

Despite continued investigations by police, there have been few developments in Trenton’s case in the past 15 years. While Melinda remains the prime suspect, there is no actual evidence implicating her in Trenton’s disappearance. In addition to the pictures and toys found in the trash bin at her apartment complex, authorities point to her failing a voice stress test and her refusing to take a polygraph as evidence that she was involved, but both of these tools are junk science. Melinda was obviously troubled and struggling, but it is also difficult to know which (if any) of the DCF complaints filed against Melinda were true, as they all came from Josh and his mother, both of whom have admitted to making false allegations against Melinda. As far as I can tell from the various DCF documents that have been published online in this case, there were never any findings that Melinda ever physically harmed or threatened Trenton. In fact, the DCF case reports ([page 1](https://imgur.com/Bsx08oq), [page 2](https://imgur.com/cDUUZqV)) that I could find state that Trenton was healthy and seemed secure and happy in his mother’s care. Furthermore, despite multiple searches of Melinda’s home, car, and personal effects (including her diary), there is no evidence that connects her to Trenton’s disappearance.

Josh has been the dominant voice in the case for 15 years (for obvious reasons) and has fully cooperated with investigators, including taking a polygraph, which he passed. However, his behavior towards both Melinda and Trenton in the two years before Trenton disappeared is troubling. Josh and his mother made repeated false allegations to DCF against Melinda. It seems that most of these allegations were made at the behest of Josh’s mother, who disliked Melinda and wanted custody of Trenton. Josh also didn’t complete the DCF case plan and parenting classes required to regain custody of his son after Trenton was placed in foster care. Prior to his disappearance, Trenton was mostly cared for by Melinda, his maternal great-grandparents, and his paternal grandmother; Josh seemed to be a fairly absent and uninterested father until his son disappeared. 

One possibility that seems to have been mostly ignored by investigators in the case is a stranger abduction. Police have said that Trenton being taken by someone outside the family was “unlikely” but there is no information as to why this is the case. While stranger abductions are rare, they are not impossible, so I do wonder if this angle was fully investigated before Melinda became the prime–and only–suspect in the case. Melinda and Trenton lived in an end unit, ground floor apartment. Trenton’s bedroom window was at the back of the apartment; directly behind the apartment was a dirt access road that leads to a gas station on US 441, a major highway. Police did acknowledge that the cut made in Trenton’s window screen was large enough for someone to reach through the window to grab Trenton, but they said they felt this was unlikely (although, they have never explained why they didn't think it was likely).

In many ways, Melinda is the easy suspect. There is a long list of allegations against her filed with DCF, she was a teenage mother, suffered from mental health issues (she had been diagnosed with OCD) and an outsider in a rural community. And yet, none of these things are evidence that she is responsible for her son's disappearance. Police relied heavily on junk science (polygraphs and voice stress tests) and unsubstantiated witness sightings to make their case. They also claim they could have arrested Melinda, but instead decided to wait it out and see if she could lead them to Trenton (again, despite not having any evidence that she knew where Trenton was). It is unclear what, if any, investigations were undertaken to determine if Trenton could have been abducted by a stranger or another unknown person.

**Additional Information**

In addition to the above information, there are a number of other strange/interesting elements of this case. Most of this information has been dismissed by law enforcement as being related to Trenton’s disappearance, but it’s often brought up in discussions around the case so I wanted to include it here as well:

* Shortly after Melinda Duckett’s death, police discovered that she had been making amateur pornography. At least one of these videos featured a baby crying in the background; Josh Duckett also appears in at least one of these videos.
* James “Jimmy” Duckett, a former Mascotte, FL police officer and Josh Duckett’s father, is currently on death row in Florida. In 1988, he was convicted of raping, strangling, and drowning an 11 year-old girl. He was already in prison on death row in Florida when Trenton was born. Trenton visited his grandfather in prison and Melinda kept a written correspondence with James Duckett.
* A number of people believe that Melinda’s death is suspicious and may not have been suicide (though there have been no findings from law enforcement that support this). Most of these claims are based on the fact that the gun was fired twice inside the closet where she died.
* Prior to Trenton’s disappearance, Melinda told friends that she wanted to learn more about her biological family and was hoping to connect Trenton to his roots. Some people believe that Melinda sent Trenton to Korea to live with relatives prior to her death, though police could find no evidence that Trenton ever left the country.

**Fifteen Years, and Still No Answers**

It has been over 15 years since two year-old Trenton Duckett vanished from his bedroom in Leesburg, FL. No trace of him has been found. Police have also not released any evidence that implicates Melinda–or anyone else–in Trenton’s disappearance. If he is alive today, he would be 17 years old; in 2019, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an [age-progressed image](https://imgur.com/Fnblcrd) of what Trenton may look like if he is alive. Anyone with information concerning Trenton’s disappearance or whereabouts is urged to call 800-CALL-FBI or 800-423-TIPS.

237,xxlilituxx,1641812756,"Stuart Pearce (33yo), Meredith (31 years) and their four children, Adam (11 years), Travis (9 years) Matthew (8 years) and Kerry (2 years) lived in a quiet house on Jackson Street, Parafield Gardens, in the North Western suburbs of Adelaide. 

Saturday the 5th of January 1991 was a day like any other. After having dinner and putting the kids to bed, around 9pm, Meredith Pearce took a phone call from her sister. She made sure to speak quietly as her husband slept before starting his midnight shift at Wingfield BP fuel station. While Meredith chatted with her sister, she gave no indication that anything was wrong or that she and her family were under any threat. 

Apparently everything was fine, as Stuart followed his usual routine when doing a midnight shift, which was to wake up around 10pm, have a meal, shower then drive the roughly 15 minutes to Wingfield to start his midnight shift.

The next morning, on Sunday the 6th of January 1991, Metropolitan Fire Service was called to the Pearce family home to find it ablaze. The fire had been reported at 7:17am, Stuart’s nightshift ended at 6:50am. The bodies of Meredith, and three of their three children, Adam, Travis, and Kerry, were found after the fire was extinguished. Matthew, luckily, had spent the night at a friend’s house. 

Meredith Pearce was found in her bedroom tied to a chair, she had a towel stuffed in her mouth, and was strangled with an electrical cord. The media reported that Adam and Travis had also been tied to chairs and had been asphyxiated by having plastic bags cover their heads. 2-year-old Kerry was reported to have been smothered to death. Autopsies revealed the family had died before the fire had been lit.

Police speculate that Stuart murdered his family before going to work. During their investigations, it was revealed that gas bottles had been set around the house on the night prior to the fire, but these failed to explode. Police suspect that Pearce returned home after his night shift and used other accelerants around the house to set the fire, before fleeing to dump his car.

Stuart’s distinctive white 240K Datsun coupe was found dumped at Arndale shopping Centre in Kilkenny, which is around 13km (8 miles) from the family home (and 4.9km [3 miles] from his workplace). Meredith’s blood was found in the boot of the car and on a door trim. Police believe that her blood was most likely transferred to the car from Stuart.

A Police search of the property during their investigation revealed that Stuart Pearce’s .303 rifle was missing. It also uncovered a bunker, which was being used to conceal a drug crop of 25 marijuana plants.

Stuart Pearce remains the main suspect in the murder of his family. Over the years, the only survivor, Matthew, who lost his entire family in one night, has been interviewed by police. He denies having any knowledge of his father’s whereabouts. Matthew told The Advertiser newspaper, in 2002 that he believed his father was innocent. Matthew has fallen into a lifestyle of Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, drugs, and crime, which is heartbreaking, but trauma can make life so difficult.

Brevet Sergeant Bob Sharpe, from the SAPOL Major Crime Investigation Branch says that there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that Stuart Pearce was responsible for the deaths of his wife and children.

""Whether he's been able to go into hiding for so many years, or whether he's taken his own life when he's realised what he's done, are the two more likely options police have to consider.""

""Over the years a number of sightings have come in -local, interstate, and overseas- all of which have been thoroughly investigated""

""In most cases police have been able to identify the people and prove who they were before 1991, so they're not Stuart Pearce.""

""It would be very difficult for someone to live off the grid for this length of time -we have his fingerprints, plus a DNA profile, and he's the subject of an Interpol red notice, but he hasn't come to our attention."" he said.

“I don’t think there was a great degree of pre-planning in relation to this matter - Mrs Pearce certainly gave no indication of any concerns in that phone call and that might explain why one child was not at the house.""

“My feeling is that he’s committed this terrible act, tried to shift blame on to someone else by deliberately dumping his car in a particular location, but when that hasn’t worked he’s taken his own life and we just haven’t found his body yet.""

“However, we certainly don’t rule out other possibilities and every piece of evidence or report that comes in is thoroughly investigated.”

Stuart Pearce has been missing for 31 years and would now be 64 years old, at the time of his disappearance he was described as a medium build, with brown hair and fair complexion. He had several distinctive tattoos, including a naked woman with a rose on her back on his upper right arm, and a red and green rose over a Maltese Cross on his lower left leg, but it's possible he's had them removed or altered. His date of birth is July 1, 1957. 
Stuart Pearce’s last known whereabouts was Parafield Gardens in South Australia, however by now he could be anywhere in the world.

A reward of up to $1 million dollars has been offered for information leading to the apprehension and/or conviction of the person, or people, responsible for the suspected murders.

amath County, Ore. — After four decades, detectives with the [Klamath County Sheriff’s Office](https://ktvl.com/news/local/kcso-arrests-former-deputy-for-unlawful-marijuana-manufacturing) solved a double homicide cold case with the help of DNA technology and genetic genealogy.

In 1978, the remains of Cynthia Frayer and Kirk Wiseman were found after they were [shot to death](https://ktvl.com/news/nation-world/texas-father-fatally-shot-in-chuck-e-cheese-parking-lot-carrying-daughters-birthday-cake-humble-calogero-duenes-amber-uresti-bday-child-dad-corpus-christi) in a wooded area near [Lake of the Woods ](https://ktvl.com/news/local/lake-of-the-woods-resort-lodge-gets-ready-to-celebrate-its-first-christmas-holiday)after hitchhiking their way from Eugene to Klamath County.

“I would love to say it’s just another case, but it’s not,” said Detective Dan Towery. “I am just lucky enough to be the last one in the chair to take it across the goal line.""

Volume 90%*KTVL*

Towery said the case was first investigated by now-retired Sheriff Carl Burkhart, who at the time did not have access to the latest technology, but was able to preserve crucial evidence that was eventually used to find the suspect.  


In 2018, articles of Cynthia's clothing were sent to a crime lab, where technicians recovered the DNA of an unknown male.

When the initial testing didn't yield any positive, pre-existing matches, the samples were then sent to Parabon. Parabon is a company that uses DNA technology and genetic genealogy, which helped law enforcement finally solve the cold case.

The chief genealogist at Parabon analyzed the samples and eventually gave Klamath County law enforcement a viable suspect name, Ray Whitson Jr. It was quickly discovered that Whitson Jr. died back in 1996.

Because the prime suspect is deceased, the case is now considered ""suspended.""

Towery said that the case was always on his mind, and now that it is officially suspended, he can finally give evidence to the victims’ families.

""There's a letter from Cynthia to her mom and dad a few days prior, it was never mailed, it talked about what they were doing in Washington, talked about their hopes and dreams, and never got mailed,” Towery said “I am going to give it to her mom.""

Howard Wiseman, father of Kirk Wiseman, said his family always felt a dark cloud over them because of all the unanswered questions surrounding Kirk and his girlfriend's death.

""I want to congratulate the Klamath County Sheriff’s department. They went way above and beyond the call of duty in closing this case for us family members,” Wiseman said.

Wiseman said that while the family can finally be at peace knowing who killed the two teens, it will never bring them back.

Towery credited Whitson’s family for giving samples of their DNA to help solidify the findings of the case.

""What we have been able to do here is bring closure to a family, and this work has allowed that family to have some degree of peace,"" said Klamath County District Attorney, Eve Costello.

Costello praised the work of the detectives and said the county hopes to create a Cold Case Unit in the future.

""I think the investigators from 1978 all the way to 2021 and now 2022 did a wonderful job, I am very proud of them, I know they are all dedicated to their work,” Sheriff Chris Kaber said.",UnresolvedMysteries,"Ray Whitson ID'd as killer of Kirk Wiseman, 19, and Cynthia Frayer, 17, both of whom were shot to death near Klamath Falls, OR, in 1978.

243,erobin37,1641779835,"Christopher G. Janus was a Chicago stockbroker and one of the first Americans allowed in the People’s Republic of China in the 1970s. When he returned to America, he revealed that he has been tasked by the government to look for the [Peking Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Man) – a collection of early human fossils discovered in China and lost during WW2 – in the United States. According to the story, the fossils were entrusted to U.S. Marines for safeguarding from the Japanese invaders. Then, the fossils disappeared.

Soon, Janus announces that he was getting closer to the fossils. After he offered rewards for the fossils, he said, a woman contacted him. She claimed to be the widow of a U.S. Marine, and that she had the fossils with her. They arranged a meeting at the top of the Empire State Building. The woman gave Janus a photograph of a box full of bones. Then, Janus recounted, “a man appeared from the shadows and pointed a camera toward them,” and the woman vanished.

With this dramatic story, Janus managed to collect $640,000, raised from investors and loaned from banks, to fund his search for the fossils and to produce a feature film – said to be directed by the renowned Otto Preminger. Janus published a book, The Search for Peking Man. In the book, he described his attempts to locate the fossils were being thwarted by a Dr. Fu Manchu-like figure who was “a person of immense intelligence and cunning \[...\] who could manipulate people and control situations.” On the back cover, he notes that “this is a true story” and the book was “soon to be a major motion picture.”

As you might have suspected, Janus was a fraudster. In the 1980s, he was charged with two counts of fraud. He did not actually use the money for the search nor the filmmaking. The photograph Janus produced has since been described as dubious. While Janus’ search may be fake, the frenzied search for the Peking Man was very much real. What really happened to the Peking Man?

**The discovery**

In the 1920s, an international archaeological team working at a site 50km southwest of Peking (Beijing), China, discovered two human-like teeth. [Davidson Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_Black), a Canadian anatomist at the [Peking Union Medical College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Union_Medical_College) (PUMC), saw it as a breakthrough in human anthropology, creating an entirely genus/species for the discovery – *Sinanthropus pekinensis*. In the following decade, the team would eventually find parts of about 50 individuals, including several complete skullcaps. Even though there were multiple specimens found, they were collectively nicknamed the “Peking Man” fossils. They were kept in two safes near Black’s office in the PUMC. However, when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the fossils vanished from history.

Today, the fossils were viewed less of a “breakthrough” – it has been reclassified as the widespread *Homo erectus*. More importantly though, the fossils played a role in both nationalistic and later Communist propaganda, as they emphasized what the government saw as the “evolutionary continuity” of Chinese ethnicity and culture. Interest in locating the lost fossils was high, and remains so in China.

**What is absolutely known about their fate**

By 1941, China was no stranger to war – the war with Japan had begun in 1937, with Beijing falling to Japan in the summer of the same year. During this time, Japan showed “great interest” in the fossils, with army officers often visiting PUMC and requesting to see the fossils. In fact, on two occasions, PUMC officials felt so threatened by the Japanese that the fossils were sent to American banks (which was then neutral) for safekeeping.

As 1941 drew near, so did rumors of war between US and Japan. Fearing such a war, and concerned about the Japanese interest, PUMC officials began considering more options to safeguard the fossils. At first, the Chinese authorities insisted that the fossils were not to be removed from China, though they eventually agreed that the best option is to move them to the United States. As such, they were last seen boxed at the PUMC at the end of November 1941. As one book on the subject puts it, “there is still not a single reliable account of a sighting of the fossils since they were packed \[…\] in 1941.” What follows is a plethora of conflicting and wildly inconsistent narratives, which can partly be attributed to intentional misdirection from the personal to national level, to avoid Japanese discovery of the fossils.

**Here's where it gets confusing**

Presented here is the most popular narrative of the fate. It may seem compelling here, but in the background are dozens of conflicting narratives – all equally lacking in evidence. 

There are no less than 5 differing accounts on who packed the fossils into what. Again, intentional misdirection is at play here. For example, one Chinese excavator claimed that they were packed by Americans – so the Chinese could maintain deniability when questioned by the Japanese. This is deemed unlikely as the packers were administrators at the PUMC who had no experience with handling archaeological materials. The most credible account is that two Chinese technicians packed the fossils in two large unpainted wooden boxes, each roughly the size of an office desk. Perhaps Americans were then allowed to re-pack the fossils. According to the Chinese technicians, then, the fossils were then delivered to the administrative wing at the PUMC, and they had no further knowledge of its fate.

In a subsequent investigation of their whereabouts (1947), Col. [William W. Ashurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_W._Ashurst), a Marine Corps commander, recounts “During November 1941, several boxes were accepted by me from the officials of the \[PUMC\], for shipment to the United States. These boxes were shipped together with other property belonging to the Marine Detachment \[…\] to [Chinwangtao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinhuangdao), China… These materials remained in the cars at Chinwangtao awaiting shipment in the [SS President Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Kachidoki_Maru) to Manila. (Philippines) and were so located when the war started on December 8, 1941.”

Note that Ashurst never mentioned “fossils” in his recollection. In fact, in a 1952 interview, Ashurst said that he did not verify that the fossils were in the boxes. In the same interview, Ashurst said that the fossils were shipped as part of his personal baggage, contradicting his earlier claims that they were shipped with the Marine Detachment properties. Another point of suspect is that in the interview, the fossils were described as “a few handfuls of yellowed and fossilized bones,” painting a starkly different picture than two office desk-sized boxes. But then, again, Ashurst did not actually see the fossils, so where did that information come from?

In any case, SS *President Harrison* never arrived at Chingwangtao. She was caught by Japanese destroyers upon the outbreak of the Pacific War and ran aground near Shanghai. And thus, Ashurst’s cargo was left at the Chingwangtao rail station. Ashurst speculated that the Japanese captured the fossils at Chingwangtao and discarded them without knowing their significance. Ashurst reiterated that he did not know if the fossils were actually part of the cargo.

PUMC’s own investigation in 1945 appeared to agree with this hypothesis. “Presumably, on December 8, 1941, it was among the Marine equipment assembled on the dock at Chingwantao awaiting transportation, all of which was seized by the Japanese military.” Note the use of “presumably” here as there is no direct evidence found to support this hypothesis. Secondly, the use of “it” to refer to the fossils – as mentioned above it is likely that they were packed in two boxes. In the PUMC’s discussions though, they were consistently referred to singularly as “the case.” 

**Here's what Japan knows… OR IS IT?**

The Japanese appeared to be unaware of the fossil’s whereabouts – though the possibilities that they had discarded it without knowing its significance, or somehow decided to hide the fossils from the rest of the world, cannot be discounted, no matter how slim. As noted before, Japan was clearly interested in the fossils. Thus in 1942, they began questioning PUMC officials about their whereabouts. They eventually obtained some leads and conducted searches at Chinwangtao, but no discovery was announced. After the war, a Japanese anthropologist who once visited the PUMC, Kotondo Hasebe, was questioned by the U.S. Occupation officials. He insisted that Japan did not know the whereabouts of the fossils.

**Recent discoveries**

After the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, excavations continued, and more fossils were eventually discovered. Since then, there were only rumors – that the fossils were now in the private collection of the Japanese Emperor, that the Nationalists had taken the fossils with them to Taiwan, that it was reburied somewhere in rural China, that it sunk with the Awa Maru…

In 2000, Chinese sources published a “recently discovered” 1945 interview where two US Marine, Sgt. Snider and Sgt. Jackson, claimed to have picked up two boxes from PUMC in December 1941. The Marines believed that the boxes contained the fossils – though they did not check their contents. However, no records of Sgt. Snider or Jackson could be found amongst the roster of soldiers in North China in December 1941.

In 2006, the local government near the fossil site established a search committee to track down the missing bones. The committee contacted Japan, who once again told authorities that they didn’t have the fossils. The lead paleoanthropologist also asked if he could form a search committee in Japan. He was turned down, and later told the media in an accusatory tone – “If you didn’t take it, what are you afraid of?” Perhaps he was adhering to the party line in blaming foreign countries for the loss of the fossils.

In 2012, Paul Bowen, the son of former U.S. Marine Richard Bowen, emailed paleoanthropologist [Lee Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Rogers_Berger) of South Africa. The son recounts his father’s tale that his unit, stationed in [Camp Holcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Holcomb), Chingwangtao in 1947 during the Chinese Civil War, was digging foxholes when they “found a box that was full of bones. \[…\] It gave us a little scare and we filled in that hole and dug another.” Berger went to China at the location described and found that it is now a warehouse and a parking lot. There was no further excavation. This discovery builds on top of the standard narrative, which was constructed through conflicting hearsays and no physical evidence.

**tl;dr**

To summarize, the fossils were last seen in the Peking Union Medical College, being packed for transport in November 1941. There is no agreement on what kind of container(s) they were packed in, and no evidence at all as to its fate after its departure from the college. Their fate was obfuscated by both intentional war-time misdirection and the fog of war. Perhaps it was safeguarded all too well. As the generation of WW2 veterans die out, it is unlikely we will find a satisfactory conclusion to the story, save for the discovery or declassification of some important documents. 

Fun Fact: In 1977, [a Hong Kong remake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Peking_Man) of *King Kong* (1976) featuring the Peking Man was released. The movie had a Japanese special effects team, who later became famous for their work in Godzilla movies.

244,CherryBlossom724,1641778051,"* **Background**

Steven Clark was born in Colchester, Essex, in 1969, to parents Charles and Doris. One day when Steven was two years old, Doris left the house to go shopping. Unbeknownst to her, Steven had somehow gotten out of the house and had started to follow her. She soon heard a commotion and found that Steven had wandered into the road and had been hit by a lorry. He spent a month in a coma and was left with a pronounced limp and permanent damage to his left arm.

He was said to be a happy person, though the limitations of his disability sometimes got him down. He worked hard and excelled in his courses, even earning an ""Apprentice of the Year"" award. He attended the Rathbone Society in Redcar, which is an organization that helps disabled people find employment. Steven very much wanted to find work, but sadly he found that employers were hesitant to hire him, due to his disability.

* **The day of Steven's disappearance**

On December 28th, 1992, Charles Clark had a ticket to go watch the Middlesbrough football match. Steven had wanted to attend the game with him, but Charles told him that he could only go if he paid for his ticket himself. Steven decided not to go. According to his parents, it was a running joke in their family that Steven didn't like to spend his own money on anything. However, it seems to me that he likely wouldn't have had much money due to not being able to find employment? In which case that was a pretty cruel joke. 

According to Doris, with Charles away at the football match, Steven decided that he wanted to go for a long walk. So they took a walk along the beach and ended up in Saltburn, around 45 minutes away from their home. At this point, Steven said he needed to use the bathroom and so they stopped at a public restroom. Steven went into the men's restroom and Doris waited outside for a minute before deciding to go into the women's restroom. When she came out, there was no sign of Steven, so she assumed that he was still in the restroom. She spotted two men and a little girl there. The two men took turns waiting outside the men's restroom with the little girl while one of them went inside. Doris didn't think to ask either man if they had seen her son in there. And she didn't want to go in there to check on him herself, because in her own words, ""He would have been horrified. He was 23, not a child."" After waiting a while longer (I couldn't find out how long exactly), she assumed that Steven had simply left without her and headed home, so she followed suit. But when she finally got home, Steven was not there. When Charles arrived home, she told him that Steven was missing and they went out to look for him together. After 24 hours had passed, they called the police. However, the police couldn't find any signs of Steven or what had happened to him either.

* **Additional info**

* There were a number of unconfirmed sightings of Steven following his disappearance, but it's unclear if any of them are credible.

* According to Charles, Steven had met a girl at The Ship Inn in Saltburn and had started dating her days before his disappearance. I couldn't find any information about her though.

* A witness came forward recently to say that she had spotted Steven near his house at around 3pm on the day he went missing, which was about the same time he supposedly vanished from a public restroom 45 minutes away. 

* In 1999, the police received an anonymous letter claiming that Steven's parents had murdered him. While the author has since come forward, her identity and the full contents of the letter have not been released. However, she admitted that she didn't actually know the family and that her accusation was merely based on a ""feeling"".

* Steven's case was officially classified as a murder in 2020 and his parents were considered the prime suspects. They were arrested, but later released. A thorough search was conducted of their house and yard, but no evidence was found.

* **Theories**

* His parents are responsible for his disappearance. We only have Doris's word for them even being at the public restroom that day, as no witness has ever come forward to corroborate her story. Also, it appears that this case was poorly investigated initially and the fact that the search of their home in 2020 turned up nothing doesn't prove their innocence, since they've had decades to get rid of anything incriminating. It's unclear what their motive would have been, but maybe whatever happened to Steven was an accident that they covered up. 

* It was a crime of opportunity and Steven was kidnapped from the public bathroom. *Or* Doris's assumption that Steven had left without her was correct and someone kidnapped him on his way home.

I know we are dealing with a group of people with questionnable mental conditions, but it seems obvious to me that the teller was only able to hand in a much smaller amount: (In this case, under $8000.)

Considering the eventual outcome that Wells would have even successfully avoided police....and gone to the first stop...there are still so many chances his car would have exploded at the drop off spot, bringing attention to the thieves. There are also so many chances the $8000 would have been on him while he exploded. There are chances he may leave the paper instructions at the bank...etc. How is this plan by any logical means a smart way to successfully obtain $250 000? Is there a chance, (other than 1/100) that it would have worked? It seems to me the plan was surprisingly well-worked out in some aspects (the bomb/obtaining access to Wells for long enough to install the device) but was unrealistically stupid in that it seemed to surely result in his murder, the murder being loud and public, and in a smaller amount of money. What do you think was the planned ending of this heist? How did they plan to actually deal with the bomb once they would have collected the money?

**2) Why did Bill Rothstein rad himself off to the cops?**  
In his case, he surprisingly succeeded in deflecting attention from himself onto Marjorie Diehl. I guess he must have been very afraid of her. Do you think there were back and forth threats between these two, and the others involved, of calling the police, and he just outsmarted his group of co-criminals by being the first to pick up the phone? However, it seems like a risky move...

3) **Moral and legal right to decapitate the victim?** I'm from Canada, and I don't even know if we have a law regarding this, but it would seem to me incredibly untactful of police forces to not contact the family before decapitating a murdered body. Is there no regulation forbidding them to carry on without approval of relatives? Couldn't they break the collar with specific tools and then glue it back together and still understand how it worked, thus preserving the victim's neck?

4) **Why was Wells so calm in his last 20 minutes when he was finally with the police?** I imagine most people in his situation would be crying, hysterical, or pleading for help with urgency. Sometimes you need dramatic type of behaviour to make authorities, who tend to stall, to get a move on and help you. The only reason that comes up for me is: He must have believed his ""friends/collaborators"" would not actually blow him up.

When I sat down to do this write-up, I knew it wasn’t going to be an easy job but it turned into so much more than I imagined. I simply cannot report on the depth of Mr. Gillern’s disappearance, and I apologize for that. I am not the best writer in the community, so please excuse my lack of ability when reading this synopsis.  The links at the bottom of the page, especially the website created by Aeryn’s mother, are best suited for telling Mr. Gillern’s story.

*Background*: 

Aeryn Michael John Gillern was born in Elmira, New York, on April 28, 1973. He disappeared in Stephansplatz, Vienna, Austria on October 29, 2007. He was employed as a research assistant by The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) which is headquartered in Vienna and began working there in 2003. Aeryn was named Mr. Gay Austria in 2006.

*Disappearance*: 

Austrian police notified Mrs. Gillern, a retired police officer, on October 31, 2007, that her son was last seen running naked from the Kaiserbründl bathhouse in Weihburggasse. It was assumed that he was involved in a fight there, but his last confirmed location was at a sauna on Stephansplatz. Police also speculated that he committed suicide by jumping in the Danube. Aeryn’s friends don’t agree with this supposition, and his mother thinks the investigation was hampered by his sexuality. The Austrian police changed their account several times and denied the presence of any witnesses even though they received a phone from people soon after he was reported missing. The Austrian police stated it was not their responsibility to investigate the disappearance because Aeryn was not a citizen and would not interview Mrs. Gillern or any of his friends. 

*Attempts at Resolution*:

Mrs. Gillern has not and will not give up the quest to learn what happened to her son. Beginning in 2008 she held a vigil every year outside of the Kaiserbründl on October 29 but has not been in Vienna the last three years due to costly airfare and Austria’s COVID lockdown. She was last informed in, second-handily, that the case is no longer an active investigation. Her website [http://www.aeryngillern.com](http://www.aeryngillern.com/) is extremely detailed and quite worth the read for, as I said, I cannot begin to describe all the ins and outs of this case. 

The 2011 documentary Gone: The Disappearance of Aeryn Gillern is dedicated to his mother's search for the truth behind her son's disappearance.

Wavy red hair.
Penis shaft removed and healed prior to his death and is not associated with his death.

Clothing;
Long-sleeve button-up western shirt
Blue jeans.
Laced-up hiking boots with round knobs on the sole..

I was wondering if he may have had gangrene of the penis leading to the removal, or if he was part of a cartel like organisation that would've done this to him either as an initiation or as punishment..

Considering he was burned, i would imagine.he hails from the US and he was burned to hide his identity, which has worked for 46 years. As he is still unidentified.

Does anyone else have any input, theories or ideas on the case?

Nothing, apparently…because they disappeared, never to be seen from again.

It’s actually quite tragic, and baffling. (And not as uncommon as you would think. There are other instances of unexplained disappearances; links at the end.)

Be warned: this mystery has no answers, just questions.

# The 5 Men and the Disappearance 

The five friends were Jack (Jackie) Huett, 24; Gary Mathias, 25; William (Bill) Sterling, 29; Jack Madruga, 30; and Ted Weiher, 32.

On the night of February 24, 1978, the five left their homes in Yuba, CA in Madruga’s white and turquoise 1969 Mercury Montego. Their destination was a basketball game in Chico, CA between UC Davis and California State University, Chico. 

They were avid basketball fans, often gathering together to watch or play basketball. In fact, they had their own game to play on the next day, February 25. It was part of a local program for the mentally handicapped and was sponsored by the Special Olympics.

You see, Mathias was diagnosed with schizophrenia while in the Army and based in Germany, and was subsequently psychiatrically discharged. Huett and Sterling had slight intellectual disabilities, and Weiher and Madruga - who was also an Army vet - were unofficially considered “slow learners.”

Anyway, they left the game and stopped at Behr’s Market in downtown Chico to buy one Hostess cherry pie, one Langendorf lemon pie, one Snickers bar, one Marathon bar, two Pepsis and 1.5 quart of milk. The clerk remembered them because she was annoyed that the men arrived right before closing at 10pm.

That was the last time they were seen alive. The morning of February 25 came and went, and when none of their guardians - who they lived with - heard from them, they notified the police.

# The Investigation

The first to be discovered was the car, on February 28, parked along Oroville-Quincy Road in the Plumas National Forest…not anywhere near or on the way to Yuba. Question #1 (and #2): how did they end up there, and why?

Maybe they were stuck in snow? But no, the snow was not so deep that five strapping, young men couldn’t push the car out. Maybe the engine stalled? The keys were missing, but when police hot-wired the car, the engine started immediately. Maybe they ran out of gas? Nope, it was one quarter full. 

The questions piled on when they examined the car further at the station and noticed no dents, gouges or even mud scrapes on its undercarriage, which should have been present given the Mercury Montego’s low-hanging mufflers, the bumpy mountain road (which is now paved, apparently), and the five grown men riding in it. 

They concluded that either the driver was extremely careful or the driver was familiar with the roads (none of the men were familiar with that area). The car was also unlocked and a window rolled down when police found it, which is uncharacteristic of Madruga.

Actually, the car was the only thing found for a while. The police were sent on wild goose chases with several reported sightings - one putting them in Arizona and Nevada - but only two were deemed credible.

First, Joseph Schons, who had indeed gotten stuck in the snow on the night of February 24 about 150 feet up the road from where the Mercury Montego was found, was experiencing a mild heart attack while attempting to free his car. He went back in the car, kept the engine running to provide heat and lied there, waiting for the pain to pass. Around midnight, he saw headlights coming up behind him and he saw the car park, headlights on and a group of people around it, one of which looked to him like a woman holding a baby. 

Question #3: who the heck was holding a baby?! He called for help and received an icy response: they stopped talking and turned their headlights off. Later, he saw lights from flashlights and received the same cold response when he called out for help. In the early morning, when his car ran out of gas and his pain subsided, he walked 8 miles (this author wishes she could walk 8 miles, let alone do it in the early morning after managing a minor heart attack and sleeping in a car) down the road to a lodge that he had passed the day before. When the manager drove him home, they passed the abandoned Mercury Montego at the point where Schons had recalled hearing the voices hours before.

Second, a store clerk about 30 miles from where the car was found told deputies that four men matching the description from the fliers the families had posted had stopped by the store in a red pickup truck two days after the disappearance. The store owner corroborated her account. But nothing came from it. Question #4-6: Were those the same men? If so, who was missing? And how did they get the red pickup truck?

# Bodies Discovered 

Maybe something foul was afoot?! But alas, no…unless you meant the smell.

Months later, on June 4, after the snow had melted, a group of motorcyclists went to a trailer camp maintained as shelter by the Forest Service off the road about 19 miles from where the Mercury Montego was found. 

The trailer’s window had been broken and when they opened the door, the odor of decay overwhelmed them. The body was later identified as Weiher’s.

The next day, searchers found remains belonging to Madruga and Sterling on opposite sides of the road about 11 miles from where the car had been. Autopsy showed they both died of hypothermia, but Madruga’s body had been partially consumed by scavenging animals, while Sterling’s bones were scattered over a small area.

Two days later, Huett’s own father found his son’s backbone two miles northeast of the trailer. His shoes and jeans were found nearby and his skull was about 300 ft away, confirming his identity through dental records. Huett too succumbed to hypothermia.

That’s four out of the five men. The fifth man - Mathias - was never found, dead or alive.

# Theories

So, what do you think? Was there foul play or did a drive take a wrong turn?

Investigators still have no idea what exactly happened to the five men: why they ended up near the Forest, why they left the car on foot, and what happened after they left the car and how long they had been dead.

The prevailing theory is that they left the car and followed a trail made by a Forest Service snowmobile the previous day in the direction of the trailer camp, hoping to find shelter nearby (reminder: the trailer was 19 miles from where the car was found). Madruga and Sterling succumbed to hypothermia about half way there, while the other three made it to the trailer, only to find it locked, so they broke a window to enter. 

Here comes the sad part: they probably thought they would be found soon and since they were literally breaking and entering, they may have feared arrest for theft if they used any of the stuff there – and there were enough foodstuff in the trailer and in a storage shed outside to sustain five grown men for a year, a butane (gas) tank, and a fireplace with matches and paperback novels to use as kindling to keep warm – all of which remained unused. But they probably stayed in that trailer for 3 months, based on Weiher’s beard length and his drastic weight loss (he was 200 lbs when he left Yuba the night of Feb 24 and he was a little over 100 lbs when they found his body on June 4). 

The theory posits that after Weiher died (and they assumed he died first because they found him with eight layers of sheets on top of him, including his head), Huett and Mathias attempted to return to civilization by foot and met their fate. Maybe Mathias made it, maybe not. All we know for sure is that his shoes were found in the trailer and he probably took Weiher’s shoes, since those could not be found.

An anticlimactic ending to a question-filled mystery. (I think they call that Occam’s razor.)

Anyway, I didn’t even cover all the speculative evidence found, like the gold watch without its crystal; you can learn about the disappearance in detail below at one of the links.

However, there is also a second mystery involving the other figures released by Hasbro in 1984 as part of the inexpensive Mini Vehicles series. 

Besides [Bumblebee](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/1/14/Bumblebeeg1toy.jpg), the Volkswagen Beetle, [Cliffjumper](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/3/33/G1_Cliffjumper_toy.jpg), the Porsche 924, and [""Bumper""](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/f/f8/G1-toy_Bumper.jpg), the Mazda Familia, there were four other characters in the Mini Vehicle assortment: [Brawn](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/2/23/G1-toy_Brawn.jpg), who transformed into a Suzuki Jimny SJ20, [Gears](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/b/b2/G1Gears_toy.jpg), who transformed into a pickup truck of indeterminate make, [Huffer](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/1/1d/G1Huffer_toy.jpg), who transformed into a semi truck loosely resembling a Volvo F88, and [Windcharger](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/4/4d/G1Windcharger_toy.jpg), who transformed into a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Like Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper, these four characters were previously sold by Japanese company Takara in 1983 as part of the [Micro Change Mini CAR Robo series.](https://www.micromanforever.com/MC04MiniCAR.htm)

Notably, Brawn, Huffer, Gears, and Windcharager have a design style separating them from Bumblebee, Cliffjumper and Bumper, who had rubber tires and resembled Penny Racers/Choro-Q toy cars, another product produced by Takara and released in the United States in 1981. Instead, these four had plastic tires and a slightly more realistic aesthetic in vehicle mode. Additionally, unlike the detailed faces seen on Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper; Brawn, Huffer, Gears, and Windcharger have extremely simplistic face designs that didn’t resemble those found on most other Transformers. Finally, Brawn, Gears, and Huffer have [“M” logos](https://static.seibertron.com/images/toys/files/01/r_gears001.jpg) on them. At first, fans believed that the logos stood for [Micro Change](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Micro_Change), and that explanation wouldn’t be questioned until 2018.

In 2018, Blake Wright started a Kickstarter campaign for a book called *Toys That Time Forgot*,  which showcased a variety of unreleased action figure concepts. Notably, the book discussed a line of figures called Mysterians, which was completely unrelated to [the 1957 movie with a very similar title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterians). The line was produced by Knickerbocker Toys, best known for producing Raggedy Ann Dolls starting in the 1960s, and was being developed in 1982 for release in 1983. However, Hasbro bought Knickerbocker in 1982 and all plans for the Mysterians, including a planned Marvel comic book series, were shelved. Hasbro would later approach Marvel to write a Transformers comic book series, with editor-in-chief [Jim Shooter](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Jim_Shooter) working on both.

Strangely, Mysterians was to consist of two completely different sub-lines. The first was [The Hidden Force](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/a/a6/Mysterians_guardians_and_warbots.jpg), a series of robots that transformed into various shapes. Notably, the line had a similar aesthetic to the [*Golden Warrior Gold Lightan*](http://www.theoldrobots.com/Ultimate4.html) series of robots that turned into cigarette lighters, with the “Tinkar” character from Mysterians being quite similar to the [“Mechanic Lightan” character from Gold Lightan.](http://www.theoldrobots.com/images68/MechanicLightan-1.JPG)

The other sub-line, [The Mobile Force](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/File:Mysterians_mobile_force.jpg) is where things start to get strange. The characters Truckar, Jeepar, and Blazar resemble the Transformers characters Huffer, Brawn, and Gears. Additionally, a fourth character, [Speedar,](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/b/bf/Mysterians_speedar.jpg) who only exists as concept art, resembles the Transformers character Windcharger. The art for these figures features even less humanlike faces that what can be seen on the Transformers figures. Although Truckar looks mostly similar to Huffer, Jeepar has a hollow semicircle instead of Brawn’s visor, and Blazar has a completely solid faceplate instead of one with a visor like Gears. The Micro Change figures feature the same faces as the Transformers release, implying that this change was not done by Hasbro, who added a [crude face sticker](https://tilallaremine.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/g1-ironhide-g1-robot.jpg) to the seat of the [Cherry Vanette figure](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aNF9-377lH4/VTv-EqUWsbI/AAAAAAAAH-E/E4FQC7z67JM/s1600/FinnOnebox01.jpg) figure to make the character Ironhide. 


Due to the release date of 1983, it seems unlikely that Knickerbocker purchased these designs from Takara, who wouldn’t release them until 1983. Additionally, the artwork for Speedar was drawn by an artist working for Knickerbocker, and not Takara. Unlike Hasbro, which used toys from various lines to create The Transformers, Takara never released any other company’s properties as part of their own line until 1985, where they began to sell Transformers.
Eventually, later in 1983, Hasbro representatives at the Tokyo Toy Show discovered the Micro Change figures and used them as part of their new Transformers line in 1984, including the four designs that were connected to Knickerbocker.

Furthermore, there are no patents for any of the original Mini Vehicle figures, even though [patents](https://www.transformerland.com/blog/g1-transformers-patent-table/) exist for most of the other original Transformers figures, making their design status unknown. However, since Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper resemble another Takara product, it can be assumed that they were designed by Takara. Although the website lists patents for Brawn, Gears, and Windcharger, they actually belong to later figures called [Outback](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/9/96/G1toy_outback.jpg), [Swerve](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/File:G1-toy_Swerve.jpg), and [Tailgate](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/8/82/G1_Tailgate_toy.jpg), which were heavily modified versions of Brawn, Gears, and Windcharger. A modified version of Huffer called [Pipes](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/0/00/G1_minibot_pipes.jpg) was also released. Notably, these figures have heads more similar to those of other Transformers, with Outback even getting hands, something that Brawn didn’t have.

In 1984, the six Hidden Force robots would be released by a company called Marchon, which would later be known for releasing a remote-controlled figure of the [Megazord](https://www.dallasvintagetoys.com/images/products/detail/IMG_1411.6.jpg) from *Mighty Morphin Power Rangers*. The characters all got new names, and the Hidden Force was rebranded as the Secret Force, but the toys were still sold as [Mysterians](http://www.theoldrobots.com/Mysterians.html). No link between Hasbro and Marchon has been discovered and it is unknown how Marchon got these molds.

Several questions about the relationship between Hasbro, Takara, Marchon, and Knickerbocker still remain unsolved:

Did Takara help Knickerbocker make the Mysterians? 

If that was the case, why didn’t they look more like Micro Change figures?

Where did Brawn, Huffer, Gears, and Windcharger get their faces from? 

If Knickerbocker made the faces, why does the packaging art not have them?

If Takara made the faces, why are they so simplistic compared to Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper’s faces or the faces of their modified counterparts?

Did Hasbro sell Knickerbocker’s Mysterians molds to Takara? 

If so, why did Hasbro not discover Micro Change until the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show? 

Additionally, why did Takara add these figures to their Micro Change line instead of making their own?

Why didn’t Takara patent any of the original Mini Vehicles?

Was it because they didn't design the figures?

Why didn't they patent Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and Bumper, then?

Why didn’t Takara or Hasbro use the Hidden Force molds? 

Were they seen as far too primitive compared to the Mobile Force? 

How did Marchon get the molds for the Mysterians Hidden Force? 

Did Hasbro sell the molds to them figuring that they were too primitive to be Transformers? 

If Marchon got the molds in 1982, why did they only release the molds in 1984, after Transformers became popular?

If Hasbro sold the molds to Marchon after the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show, why would they enable a potential competitor?


TL;DR

Four characters sold by Hasbro as part of the Transformers Mini Vehicles line seem to have been created by a company called Knickerbocker Toys as part of a line called Mysterians.

Knickerbocker never released the figures, with them being added to Japanese toy company Takara’s Micro Change line, which would later inspire Transformers.

A company called Marchon would later release other Mysterians figures that were not used by Takara after Hasbro released the Transformers, changing the character names, but still using *Mysterians* branding.

It is unknown who made the Mysterians molds, why they were released by Takara, or how Marchon was able to sell the remaining Mysterians.

I still believe that Tom committed suicide, I don’t know how much his family knows but it was interesting to finally hear someone from the state involved in the investigation. 

[Episode link](https://www.texasmonthly.com/podcast/tom-browns-body-chapter-9/)

For those unfamiliar with this case a quick recap: Tom was a teenager from Canadian, Texas who went missing in November of 2016. His remains were found a few years later with no cause of death able to be determined. Canadian is a small town where everyone knows everyone and there are a large amount of rumors regarding what happened, including that he committed suicide and his family moved his body to avoid the shame, the ex-sheriff of the town murdered Tom, he was shot on accident by another teen, etc. 

There’s a lot of interesting aspects of this case even if his cause of death is not a true mystery (in my opinion). There are a lot of unanswered questions and interesting characters involved. I highly recommend reading Skip’s articles in Texas Monthly or listening to the podcast.

253,appeltreeingarden,1641679308,"On October 31st, 1955, Marilyn Damman took her 7 month old daughter Pamela and her 2 year old son Steven to the Food Fair market to buy a loaf of bread. The market is close to where the family lived in East Meadow, about 1 and a half blocks away from their house. They arrived at the store at around 2.30 P.M. Marilyn left the children outside of the store. When she returned outside around 2.40 P.M, both children were gone. Marilyn at first thought Steven might have pushed his sisters pram back to their house, so she returned home. It would turn out that that was not what had happened. 

Pamela would be found by a family friend approximately 300 feet from the Food Fair Market. She was still in the pram, and she was unharmed. 

A large search was conducted for Steven who was still missing. Around 5000 people, both law enforcement officers and civilians, searched for the missing child but uncovered no trace of him. At 6.30 P.M November 1st, the search for Steven was called off, and determined that Steven had been kidnapped. 

At first, the police wondered if this could be a crime motivated by ""maternal desire."" Meaning, a person who might have miscarried or whose child might have died were so distraught and wanting of a child that that would prompt them to steal a child. Link to article explaining this further: [Heidi Broussard case.](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/FBI-says-Magen-Fieramusca-charged-with-14970795.php) They looked into this and looked for children who died in the area shortly before Steven was kidnapped. The police also compiled a list of six ""deviants"" in the area of East Meadow who they reasoned could possibly be behind the disappearance. 

The Damman family would receive a series of ransom notes demanding large sums of money in exchange of the child. This was in November of 1955. It would turn out that the letters were written by a opportunistic college student who actually had nothing to do with the disappearance. 

Also at the end of November 1955, Steven's parents made a public plea to the kidnappers to make sure Steven got to take his vitamins and his iron supplements. Steven was anemic. 

It's been speculated that Steven was the boy in the box, a John Doe child found dead in 1957. This was ruled out after a DNA test. A man came forward in 2009, claiming to be Steven. This was also ruled out because of a DNA test.

On January 23rd 1959 10 very experienced hikers (8 male 2 female) boarded a train to head to the Ural mountains which is in the middle of the Soviet Union. Throughout their trip the group made pretty consistent journal entries and took lots and lots of pictures on their camera. On January 28th one of the hikers (male) felt ill and decided to head back home while the rest of the group continued the hike. A search party is later launched as no one has heard from the group. On February 26th the group of searchers found the hikers campsite. The tents in the campsite were completely destroyed and had been slashed open with a knife from the inside, all their belongings were in disarray. 9 sets of footprints were found walking away from the tent. Based on the way the appearance of the footprints it's as if the group made their way calmly and they were most certainly walking. The footprints led them to the edge of the forest and next to an improvised campfire where two bodies that were two of the hikers were found. The two bodies were way underdressed for the type of the weather they were in. The tree next to them had signs that it had been climbed. Three of the other hikers bodies were found in the distance from the tent to where the other two were found they were better dressed than the other two but still were underdressed. All 5 of them died of hypothermia, some of them had minor injuries and 4 of them died while intoxicated. The last 4 hikers were found at the bottom of a small cliff. 3 of them had lethal injuries and they were compared to that of a fall. Two of them had gaping eye sockets and one of the women had a missing tongue. Six of the hikers died from hypothermia while the other 3 died from physical trauma. On May 28th the case was closed with the explanation that ""The cause of death was an unknown compelling force that the hikers were unable to overcome."" The case remained closed until the Soviet Union decided to re-open the case in 2019 and presented their findings in July of 2020. They claimed that the hikers had died due to fear of an avalanche, then the case was closed.

I would argue that there are many holes in the theory of fear of an avalanche. There are also many other injuries the hikers sustained as well as photos and journal entries that I did not detail in this post that are worth looking at. I wonder what actually happened to them. I'm tied between foul play and something natural, though I feel like their wasn't a third party involved. Was one of them a threat to the rest? It would explain the tent being cut from the inside.

255,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,1641663600," **Details:** Thirty-nine-year-old Chuck Morgan was a successful businessman who was the president of his own escrow agency. He was also a potential witness in a state land fraud case involving a known crime boss. On March 22, 1977, he left his Tucson, Arizona home to drive two of his daughters to school. After dropping them off, he vanished. Three days later, he arrived back at his home. According to his wife, Ruth, he was missing a shoe, had a plastic handcuff around one ankle, and had his hands tied together with a plastic zip tie. He could not speak, but with a pen and paper, he wrote down that he had been kidnapped and tortured. He also wrote that a hallucinogenic drug had been painted on his throat. He claimed that this drug would drive him insane or kill him if he ingested it. He asked Ruth to move his car, because he did not want ""them"" to know that he had returned home. However, he would not say who ""they"" were. He also told her not to call the police because a hit would be put out on the lives of them and their family members.  
For one week, Ruth nursed Chuck back to health by feeding him with an eye dropper. Before his voice returned, he began to allude to a secret identity. He claimed that he had worked as an agent for the federal government and he fought against organized crime. He also claimed that ""they"" had taken his treasury identification. He said that he escaped from his captors near Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport.  
After his kidnapping, Chuck became justifiably paranoid. He began wearing a bulletproof vest. He also started driving his daughters to and from school. He informed the school that nobody else should be allowed to pick them up. On June 7, two months after his initial disappearance, Chuck vanished again. Shortly before his second disappearance, he told his father that if anything were to happen to him, there was a letter he had written that would tell them who was responsible. The letter was never found; however, nine days later, an unidentified woman called Ruth and said: ""Chuck is alright, Ecclesiastics 12: 1-8"". This is a reference to a Bible passage, which reads, in part:  
*""Men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road. Remember him before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed. Then the dust will return to the earth as it was and the spirit will return to God who gave it.""*  
Two days later, Chuck was found shot to death despite the fact he was found wearing a bulletproof vest. His body was found in the desert thirty feet off the highway in the San Juan Springs area. He had been shot once in the back of the head with a bullet from his .357 Magnum, which was lying beside him. No fingerprints were found on it. Gunshot residue was found on his left hand, indicating he had fired a weapon. In his car, police found a note that had directions to the crime scene written in his handwriting. Also found in the car were several weapons, ammunition, and a CB radio. Strangely, a piece of one of his teeth was found wrapped in a white handkerchief in the back seat. A pair of sunglasses was also found that did not belong to him.  
Strangely, Chuck had clipped a $2 bill inside his underwear. Written on the bill were seven Spanish names from the letters A to G. Also, Ecclesiastics 12 was written, with the verses 1 through 8 marked by arrows drawn on the bill's serial number. This was the same reference that the female caller had made to Ruth. On the back of the bill, the signers of the Declaration of Independence were numbered 1 through 7. Also, a crude map was drawn, which show several roads between Tucson and the Mexican border. The towns Robles Junction and Sasabe were marked; these towns are apparently known for smuggling.  
Two days after Chuck's death, an anonymous woman spoke to an officer for the Pima County Sheriff's Department on the telephone. She claimed that he was supposed to meet her at a local motel shortly before he died. She claimed that her nickname was ""Green Eyes"" and that she was the same woman that had called Ruth several days earlier. She also claimed that at the motel, Chuck showed her a briefcase containing several thousand dollars in cash. He said that the money would buy him out of a gang contract that had been put on his life.  
Surprisingly, despite the bizarre evidence, authorities ruled that Chuck committed suicide. They believed that he did so either because of financial difficulties or fears for his safety. His family and a reporter named Don Deveraux believe he was murdered. Some investigators also suspect that his death was not a suicide.  
Shortly after Chuck's death, his impounded car was broken into while it was in police possession. Around that same time, his office was also ransacked. Three weeks after his death, two men claiming to be FBI agents arrived at the Morgan home. They told Ruth that they had to look through the house. They tore the house apart and searched for quite awhile. It is unknown if they ever found anything or if they were even FBI agents. When Deveraux contacted the FBI, they claimed that they had never even heard of Chuck Morgan.  
There are several rumors surrounding this case, including that Chuck was killed because he was involved with illegal activity or was doing secret work for the government. His death seems just as unexplained as the events leading to it.  
**Suspects:** Although Chuck claimed that he was working against organized crime, some believe that he was actually involved with it. During the 1970s, Tucson, along with other cities in Arizona, became a place that the mafia moved to, due to its warm climate and controversial criminal justice system. Led by former New York Don [Joseph Bonanno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bonanno), more than five-hundred racketeers moved to Tucson during the 1970s. Their influence led to several gangland-style killings in the area, one of the more famous being the murder of investigative reporter [Don Bolles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bolles).  
What made Arizona most attractive to crime syndicates was a unique state law that allowed them to buy land through numbered blind trust accounts. This would allow them to remain anonymous and successfully launder money. Chuck did real estate escrow work for at least one Mafia family. They may have used him to do escrow work for purchases of gold bullion and platinum; this was a more convenient way for them to launder money. Starting in 1973, it appeared that he was doing several million dollars of escrow work in bullion and platinum. In reality, there was no bullion or platinum. Instead, the money was moved through several escrow accounts and ""legitimized.""  
On one occasion, Chuck mentioned to Ruth that money laundering was occurring in Tucson; however, he claimed that he was not involved in it. He also stated that the less she and the children knew about his activities, the better it would be for them. It is theorized that Chuck Morgan was killed by members of organized crime in the Tucson area. It is possible that the Mafia family that he worked for had him killed because he knew too much. One theory is that organized crime bosses put the word out that they wanted Chuck dead. A hit-man then told Chuck, so he came up with the money in order to buy the hit-man off. However, when the two met in the desert, the hit-man killed him anyway and took the money. This theory has not been confirmed.  
**Extra Notes:** This case originally aired on the February 7, 1990 episode.  
Although it was not mentioned in the segment, Chuck was a secret witness in an extensive land-fraud investigation and was interviewed about it in May 1977, shortly before his death. It is not known if this had anything to do with his death. Also not mentioned was that Chuck had been seen at several restaurants and motels on the west side of Tucson after his disappearance and before his death.  
**Results:** Unsolved. After the case aired, *Unsolved Mysteries* received several calls relating to Chuck's death. Don Deveraux investigated several leads that came up as a result of the program. He learned that Chuck was heavily involved in money laundering activities through his Tucson escrow company. From 1973 to his death in 1977, he was also involved in large gold and platinum transactions. He apparently received a large amount of money from these activities, and some of this money allegedly came from Southeast Asia. Deveraux discovered that Chuck kept duplicate records of the illicit transactions. Deveraux now believes that Chuck was killed because he still had these records.  
Three months after the broadcast, [Doug Johnston](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Doug_Johnston) was found shot to death in his car outside of his Phoenix office. Interestingly, he worked across the street from Deveraux's office, and drove an almost identical car. Deveraux now believes that he was supposed to be killed instead of Doug. A year after Doug's murder, Deveraux was contacted by a writer from D.C. named [Danny Casolaro](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Danny_Casolaro). He agreed to share with him the information that he had uncovered about Chuck's illegal gold transactions. However, Danny died suspiciously before he received the information. All three cases remain unsolved. Sadly, Chuck's widow, Ruth Morgan, died in 2006.

257,Bluest_waters,1641662243,"The brain illness in Canada is getting worse and is actually more serious than previously reported. 

https://gizmodo.com/frightening-new-details-emerge-about-mystery-brain-illn-1848321759

&gt;A possible cluster of a mysterious brain illness afflicting people in New Brunswick, Canada may be larger than officially reported, according to an investigation published by the Guardian earlier this week. As many as 150 people may have developed unexplained neurological symptoms dating back to 2013, including cases where people became sick after close contact with another victim. But it is not clear whether local health officials will conclude that any of these cases are truly connected, pending an upcoming report of theirs expected later this month.

Those are official figures. But turns out there is likely a lot more cases than that. 

&gt;**According to the Guardian, however, there have been many more similar cases unofficially documented by doctors**. Citing multiple sources, the Guardian reported that as many as 150 cases may be out there. In nine of these cases, a person developed symptoms following close contact with someone else similarly sick, often while caring for them. What’s more, younger people, who rarely develop these sorts of neurological symptoms, have been identified within and outside the official cluster.

Many people have suggest that the blue green alae toxin BMAA is to blame for this. So logically you would test the deceased for that toxin, right? 

Well....

&gt;The cases among close contacts suggest a common environmental factor. And there has been some speculation by experts that β-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA)—a toxin produced by blue-green algae—could be to blame. Some earlier research has shown that lobsters, a popular harvested food in the province, can potentially carry high levels of BMAA. ***But efforts by federal scientists to examine the brains of those deceased for BMAA, the Guardian reports, have so far not been allowed by the New Brunswick government***, despite families themselves wanting the tests to be done.

They are literally stopping scientists from diagnosing this illness. Why? Possibly because it would have a devastating impact on the local fishing industry. 

BMAA has been linked to both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 

&gt;BMAA can cross the blood–brain barrier in rats. It takes longer to get into the brain than into other organs, but once there, it is trapped in proteins, forming a reservoir for slow release over time.[12][13]

&gt;Mechanisms

&gt;Although the mechanisms by which ***BMAA causes motor neuron dysfunction and death*** are not entirely understood, current research suggests that there are multiple mechanisms of action. Acutely, BMAA can act as an excitotoxin on glutamate receptors, such as NMDA, calcium-dependent AMPA, and kainate receptors.[14][15] The activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 is believed to induce oxidative stress in the neuron by depletion of glutathione.[16]

&gt;BMAA can be misincorporated into nascent proteins in place of L-serine, possibly causing protein misfolding and aggregation, both hallmarks of tangle diseases, including **Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Lewy body disease**. In vitro research has shown that protein association of BMAA may be inhibited in the presence of excess L-serine.[17]",UnresolvedMysteries,"The mysterious brain illness in Canada is worse than official figures show, leading to allegations of a cover up.

265,Environmental_War_62,1641594055,"So this is a case I heard about years ago and recently just popped back into my mind. It is a brazilian case, I'm not brazilian so if anyone wants to add/correct something feel free to do so. 

July 7, 2007. The body of 32 years old José Cicero Henrique was found in Paturis Park, he had his pants around his knees and had been shot in the head, he is considered to be the Maniac's first victim. All of the Maniac's other victims were also found in this Park, which was a common meeting point for gay men and male sex workers frequented the area at night, because of this the case is also referred as the Paturis Park Murders. Eleven of them were killed with one shot to the head, one victim was actually show twelve times and another one was beaten to death. Most of them were also found partially undressed, usually with their pants down. It was determined that the guns used in the crimes were a .38 and a .380.  I couldn't find the specific timeline with each death, but one article mentions the bodies were found in this park from July 2007 to August 2008.  

During the initial investigation, there was a man only referred as Leonardo, that I think is an important part. Leonardo went to Paturis Park to meet other men in a regular basis and he actually found three of the victims bodies. Obviously, this caught police's attention and he was considered a suspect, however he was cleared after he was tested for gunpower residue and the results came back negative. Apparently he also crossed paths with the maniac on one occasion. He said the night of August 2, 2008 he went to the Park at night as he usually did, there he came across a man a tanned man around 1,65 m and tried to flirt with him, the man reacted badly so Leonardo walked away. Minutes later he heard gunshots coming from the place he had seen the man, he went back there and found the body of 47 years old Miguel Gonçalves de Oliveira Filho, an article mentions he had several gunshots so I assume he was the one who was shot twelve times (some articles don't give any names so I had to piece together who is who based on the different sources I found). Leonardo then called the police, the article that published his testimony mentions the police had made a sketch of the suspect based on Leonardo's description but this sketch had not been released and I'm not sure if it ever was. The article also says Leonardo acted as a sort of intermediary between the police and the gay men that visited the park.   

Police also considered the Maniac to be responsible for the murder of 27 years old Pedro João Itavan Peixoto in Osasco, which is close to Carapicuíba. Peixoto was described as a ''travestie'' that went by the name of Pamela. Peixoto was found dead in a motel with a gunshot to the head, making them the only victim that was not killed in the Park. I couldn't find the exact date of their death but I did find an article about it from October 18, 2008, so they were killed after Oliveira Filho, making them the last known victim. An article published on December 2, 2008 mentions police had two possible suspects that could be the Maniac. Suspect#1 was a former sergeant wanted in connection to the murder of Pedro/Pamela, it says the two had checked in the motel together. Suspect#2 was a man who also had a military past and had killed six ''travesties'' in the 90's, which earned him the nickname ''the travesti killer'' and had also carried out his crimes with a .38 mm gun. Police eventually arrested a man named Jairo Francisco Franco on December 10, which based on all I have read, was suspect# 1 given he was a retired sergeant. Police suspected Franco to be Maniac based on witnesses testimonies, some articles and the Beyond the Rainbow episode on this mention there were two key witnesses, one put him in the park at the same time and at the same spot where one victim was killed (so I'm guessing this witness was Leonardo), the other one was a street seller that recognized Franco and claimed to have seen roaming in Paturis Park often. Despite this Franco was charged with only one murder, again the article that reported this did not name the victim but it did say it was victim# 13 so I'm guessing they were referring to the murder of Pedro/Pamela. Franco's trial ended in 2011 and he was acquitted from charges brought against him. No other suspect has been arrested or charged with the murders of the other twelve men. 

As for the motive, it seems pretty clear these were hate crimes. One of the detectives working on the case is quote as saying: ''In his (the Maniac's) mind he is doing a clean-up job. He doesn't likes homosexuals. He hates them.'' It has also been theorized the killer was homosexual himself, some sources do mention the victims indeed had some type of sexual encounter before being shot, this has lead to speculation that the killer took out his own self-loathing in his victims after having these encounters.  

This is pretty much all I have found this killer. A brazilian podcast called Café com Crime made an episode on this case, I tried listen to it but since I don't speak portuguese I couldn't really understand what was being said. Anyways, thanks for reading and happy new year.

...A place of not much note except to those who lived there – until the night of 23 November 1978 when a major crime was committed and Murwillumbah became the surprised scene of the biggest bank heist in Australia’s history. It was audacious, meticulous, consummately professional, old school. It has gone down in history as the perfect crime in which no one was physically hurt. In 43 years it has never been solved; an enduring mystery that has achieved folklore status in the small northern rivers town.

The Transecurity armoured truck which did a run of the banks between the Queensland border and Sydney was a familiar sight in Murwillumbah, sometimes stopping the traffic as armed guards unloaded it into the overnight holding bank. Every second Wednesday there would be a big payroll from the federal government on board to meet pension cheques and wages.

Sometime on the Wednesday night of the 23 November the locks at the back door of the bank were picked; there was no alarm. Using an electro-magnetic diamond-tipped drill which clamped on to the safe and allowed them to drill 18cm holes within 5mm of the crucial point in the locking mechanism they then fed through a medical cystoscope with wires to manipulate the tumblers in the safe’s locking mechanism.

This story was never covered in the news, but days after the incident, Boston Police issued an eerie [Community Alert](https://bpdnews.com/news/2021/12/1/bpd-community-alert), warning bar patrons of drugged drinks and ""strangers attempting to lure individuals away from their friends"". 

This next line caught the eye of many long-time Bostonians: 

&gt;""Should you observe any individual who appears to be in distress, wandering alone late at night or dressed unsuitably for the weather, be sure to contact the police immediately"".

Since 2007, at least eight attractive men in their 20s have vanished on winter nights. Many of them were last seen underdressed and disoriented in the cold. 

All of their searches met a tragic end in the Charles River or Boston Harbor:

One for me was the Kristin Smart case, a 20 year old female that was found drunk and passed out on the lawn is taken by 3 people to be brought back to her dorm. However on the way the other 2 left her alone with Paul Flores to take her. She was never heard from since, all of his alibis contradicted one another. He had a bruise on his face that occurred around the time of Kristin disappearance, and claimed that it had happened do to him fixing a radio in his car. But he had given other multiple reasons as to why he had the bruise before, and the trajectory of his claims didn't match up to the bruise. He is getting charged for it 25 years later, but the arrest largely stagnated due to lack of evidence. He was the main suspect for years and had likely buried her body with his father in his backyard, then moved it again to (presumed) other property his father owned.

275,Far_Valuable5819,1641530086,"Today I was listening to my favorite true crime podcast, **Going West**.  If you have never listened to **Going West** run and do it now! Well after you finish reading this post.  You can't find a better podcast duo than the **Going West** hosts, Daphane Woolsoncroft and Heath Merryman.  The episode was a special one to celebrate their 3 year podcast anniversary, The Ruth Price 911 Call // Episode 162. 

I have to be honest, before today I had never heard the story of Ruth Price and the 911 call she placed. At the beginning of the call, Ruth begins to give her address as **3877** but is cut off by the 911 operator.  During this 911 call, Ruth presents herself as an elderly woman who is concerned about a man who knocks on her door saying he is looking for an apartment.  Ruth pauses after giving this information, then you hear a blood curdling scream and Ruth says something about not being able to breath.  

If you have never heard this 911 call, listen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgrG1o8vESw).  **Please note that there is one of the most disturbing screams that you will ever hear in this call.**  

As I googled this 911 call multiple Reddit posts and even an [article](https://catacombsofcrime.medium.com/ruth-price-911-call-fact-or-fiction-an-examination-of-the-evidence-b0045fba7ed1) show up speculating if this 911 call was real or a some kind of hoax.  (Apparently this 911 call has been circulating the internet for a few decades. And first appeared in the late 80's early 90's.)  One theory was that it was created as a training call for 911 operators.   Over the years, people have tracked down possible Ruth Prices but have been unable to link them to this 911 call.

I however believe I found the missing evidence to link it to a Ruth Price mentioned by Daphane and Heath in their **Going West** episode. 

I'm do genealogy as a hobby and love to dig and do research.  (By the way, if anyone reading this is involved in genetic genealogy and want to offer me a job I'm in! A woman can dream.) To avoid taking down my Christmas tree I started an ancestry tree on the 3rd option that Daphane and Heath had mentioned, a Ruth Mildred Starr Price.

Ruth Mildred Starr was born in Pueblo, Colorado on December 7, 1913 to Thomas O Starr and Johanna Egler.  Ruth went to Central High School in Pueblo Colorado, see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SG4Cf-a4o3GA-HcGV5di1kDt-jxguuwm/view?usp=sharing) for a yearbook photo. Ruth Starr married William Walter Price and both were still listed as living in Pueblo, Colorado in 1935, but then can be found in a 1940 Census living in San Diego, California.  

I also found this Ruth in a 1973 San Diego City Directory living at **3877 N 35th Street** in San Diego.  (Remember that Ruth in the 911 call said she lived at 3877 before the 911 operator cut her off.)  

It appears that Ruth and William had two daughters and William passed away in 1972. 

During my research, I found a listing for an obituary for Ruth M Price in May of 1994 in the San Diego Union-Tribune. The entire obituary wasn't being shown so I went looking for the full obituary.   Instead I found a Ruth M Price listed in a newspaper section called *Assaults* on November 3,1980 in the San Diego Evening Tribune.  In this newspaper clipping it says Ruth M. Price was assaulted on the **3800 block of 35th Street**! This newspaper clipping fits the Ruth Price 911 call perfectly!! You can find a screenshot of this newspaper clipping [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRlMRer3GZVRF3XbbOXeZgx4cQzpJ3Bd/view?usp=sharing). 

I truly believe that this is the missing piece that identifies THEE Ruth Price of that unknown 911 call.  It wasn't a hoax or a 911 training call, that blood curdling scream was unfortunately very real!  The good news is Ruth even being older in age, fought off her attacker and lived for another 14 years.   
One more note is that in reading another reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qp9b7e/the_murder_of_ruth_price_a_lengthy_debunking/), most likely this 911 call isn't really a 911 call. Apparently, there was no 911 in San Diego in 1980 so most likely Ruth Price was talking to an operator of some kind.  Maybe she dialed ""0"" or had reached the police station.   

Thoughts?  Did I find the missing link to bring an end to this unresolved mystery?

I still have some sources to check, and one or two people to talk to who may have some information, as well as an email in to the Iredell County Sheriffs dept. I hope to discover more, but I can't be sure there's anything more to uncover.

**December 9th, 1976. Howards Bridge road in the rural community of Union Grove, North Carolina.**   
Just after lunch time, local resident named Claude Howard discovers the nude body of a deceased female on the edge of a farm field just off the main road near the bridge the road is named for. How and why she was there and just who left her there is still a mystery to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Daria Elaine Smith was born in Nottoway, Virginia on New Years Day, 1953.**I haven’t been able to find much about her early life, but by the time high school rolls around she’s living with her parents in Lanham-Seabrook, Maryland attending DuVal High School, which today is a prominent public magnet school.

Daria seems to have been a good student, and was involved with numerous activities, including the school’s forensic league and numerous musical groups. She also was a student government representative.She graduated from DuVal in 1970, and disappears from the public record until 1973, when she enlists in the US Army and is sent to Viet Nam.Of note, at the time of her enlistment women could only serve in a few capacities, and due to her rank at discharge, was most likely an army nurse. Her enlistment ended May 2nd, 1975. It’s highly likely that she met her future husband Charles Ray Wade during her time in the service. He also served in Viet Nam and was discharged as a PFC (private first class). Wade was originally from Wilson, NC.

The couple are married 15th of March, 1975, three months before Daria leaves the army. In the end, whatever drew Charles and Daria together wasn’t enough to keep them together. Though there was no legal divorce, the couple separated fairly quickly.

Based on what records are available, it’s believed that post discharge and pre separation, the Wades moved to Salisbury together attend Livingstone College, an historically black Christian school. It’s possible this was accomplished using funds from the GI Bill.

Daria’s parents either follow her to NC or had already moved here, though I suspect it’s the former, as they are living at 721 Old Plank road, which is on the street behind that runs behind the college.

Neither of the Wades ever appear in the Livingstone College yearbooks. Daria would not have been there long enough and Charles must have dropped out after his estranged wife’s death.

&amp;#x200B;

**Midday, December 9th, 1976** Charles Howard noticed a woman’s fur coat laying in the muddy track of a side road that led to a farm field. As he stopped to investigate, he also found shoes and a pair of dungaree style pants with a black belt before realizing that they belonged to the body of a young black woman, who was laying not far away in the middle of the road, near a mud puddle.

Daria Wade was nude, but retained curlers in her hair, earrings, a ring on each hand, and a third ring was found on the ground nearby.

To the Iredell County Sheriff’s department, who responded to the scene, there were no obvious sign of what had killed her. The NC State Bureau of Investigation, who were called in to assist had the same experience. Wade had a scratch across her back and a noticeable bruise on her hip, but no signs of major trauma or injury. There was no ID or a pocketbook, and it would be a day or better before the hard work of Lt. Detective Deane Barnette paid off, and the young woman they found in the mud would have her name back.

Tom Thompson, the sheriff of Iredell county was quick to tell the Statesville Record &amp; Landmark at the time “That place is used as a lover’s lane and for drinking parties”.

I have been unable to substantiate that claim with anyone in the area. At any rate, it seems highly unlikely a nearly impassable muddy wallow would be the scene of that kind of carrying on, and seems even more unlikely an African American girl would, in the year 1976 with race relations being what they were, be out partying with the local farm boys of north Iredell.

He also noted that a witness or witnesses had seen a light colored Chevrolet station wagon in the area that night. It’s unknown if, and probably unlikely the vehicle was ever found.

The weather the night before had been particularly cold, with the temperature remaining below 20 degrees Fahrenheit from midnight until about 8 or 9 AM, a couple hours before Wade’s body was discovered. An autopsy performed in Raleigh would eventually conclude the cause of death as exposure, but would also indicate that Wade had a blood alcohol level of .18, which would be considered in most people “very drunk”, and a good bit higher than the legal state threshold of .10. It was also casually noted that there was “some evidence of drugs in the body”, but this is never clarified or further explained. The only other evidence of note was that Wade had scratches on her knees, as if she had been crawling on the ground before her death. There was no evidence of sexual assault.

No obituary is available for Wade online (but I hope to check Rowan county's archives for the local paper soon, which are not digitized), but her death must have been a nightmare for her parents. She would be buried with honors in the Salisbury National Cemetery, her headstone noting her service to her country in Viet Nam.

After an article on December 11th noting the autopsy results, no other word is ever published about Wade’s death in Iredell county again. She is either purposely forgotten or the case goes cold.

Perhaps Sherriff Thompson thought enough attention had been paid to the accidental death of a drunken black girl from another county. Perhaps there simply was no other course of discovering what happened with no further leads or evidence to pursue. Any attempt to understand what happened and why would be speculation.

But it has to be noted that someone brought Wade to that muddy field in Iredell county, over an hour from home, and completely off the main road. Someone left her there in the below-freezing temperatures, and someone is owed some blame for what happened to her.

Who this party or parties might be is not likely to ever be known. It would of course be no great leap of the imagination to think that Wade’s estranged husband must have been looked at, but he was never charged, and so whatever evidence or suspicions there might have been (if any) it would not have been enough to pursue charges.

The exact events that lead to Daria Wade’s death are unknown, but I would like to make a few conjectures based on what evidence there is.

**Speculation.**  
Terminal burrowing and more importantly in this case, paradoxical undressing are well established phenomena that are seen in cases of hypothermia, and Wade shows signs of both, having been found nude and with abrasions on her knees.

I have to believe that whoever brought her to Iredell county had planned something untoward. Either abandoning her, as happened, or something far more appalling. Whatever the case, I would deduce that the bruise on her hip might have been a result of that action- perhaps suffered as she was shoved or kicked out of a vehicle. Left there in the dark woods, drunk, alone, she wouldn’t have had much of a chance of surviving the night, and ultimately didn’t.

I also want to say that the chance of accidentally finding the location where she was left is almost impossible. Most of the highways that would make the drive shorter today were not present in 1976, and the path from Salisbury would be across numerous rural roads, making numerous turns. To randomly arrive on Howards Bridge road in the middle of the night is a near impossibility. While the road does start at NC highway 901 just in front of Union Grove school, the road itself only goes further into country, really going nowhere unless someone makes several specific turns.

So why would someone have known the area? The late 1970's were the raucous end of the Union Grove Fiddle Convention, an old time/bluegrass festival that had been taking place since the 1920's,but which had devolved into drugs, fighting, and if the rumors can be believed, rape. People came from all over the country to attend the festival, and in it's last years, there were a lot of unsavory types coming too.

I believe it was the year before Wade was found that the Hells Angels were barricaded from entering the festival by the Iredell County Sherriff's Department. In fact, there's a (locally) famous picture of deputies lined up across NC highway 901, blocking the Angels from coming down the road.  
They are standing right in front of where Howard Bridge meets NC-901.

**Purposely Forgotten**  
I think Wade's case was likely abandoned without much effort. She had a lot working against her. She was an outsider. She was immoral in many people's estimation, due to her autopsy. She was African American. And that last one is one I don't bandy about carelessly, but I know this area, I know people who were alive at the time, and the death of one drunk black girl probably didn't elicit much sympathy.

278,Basic_Bichette,1641517621,"The Kent County Sheriff's Office has announced that Ada Bones Jane Doe, a woman whose remains were discovered near Ada Township, Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1997, has been identified as Stephanie Renee Judson by the DNA Doe Project. Judson was originally from Benton Harbor, Michigan, but she was identified by the DDP through relatives in Mississippi. She was last known to be in the company of one Gregory Kelly, a violent repeat offender who was later convicted of sex trafficking and died in prison in 2020 of COVID-19. 

She left behind a sister and two children who had searched for her extensively but never found her. Unfortunately her mother died just two months ago, and never learned that her daughter had been found or identified.

The DNA Doe Project hasn't announced the identification yet, but the Kent County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that DDP handled the identification. Detective Dustin Cook called the process ""incredible"".

I'm guessing this is one of the eleven unannounced identifications mentioned by the DNA Doe Project in its end-of-year summary. She did have a good match in June of last year.

279,claustrophobicdragon,1641516625,"The night of January 5, 2021, an unknown individual placed two pipe bombs in Washington, D.C. Their intended targets were the headquarters of America's two major political parties, with one device each planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committees. While both bombs were discovered before they exploded, the FBI has described them as ""viable and could have been detonated, resulting in serious injury or death."" Reports [have surfaced today](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/06/harris-was-inside-dnc-on-jan-6-when-pipe-bomb-was-discovered-outside-526695) that then-Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris was inside the DNC headquarters when the bomb was discovered and was evacuated by US Secret Service.

While hundreds of people have been arrested and prosecuted for their role in the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, no one has been named as a suspect in the attempted bombings. The FBI has released several different surveillance videos that capture the unknown suspect's movements in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on the night of January 5. Those videos can be found [here](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/press-releases/fbi-washington-field-office-releases-video-and-additional-information-regarding-the-pipe-bomb-investigation-090821). An [additional video](https://youtu.be/DVGedQ17XqI) shows a summary of the route they believe the bomber took overlaid with surveillance footage from specific locations. The FBI [has stated](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/press-releases/fbi-washington-field-office-releases-video-and-additional-information-regarding-the-pipe-bomb-investigation-090821) that they ""[believe] the suspect had a location in the vicinity of Folger Park from which the person was operating"" but that they also ""believe the suspect is not from the area."" Analysis of the footage has allowed federal investigators to publish the following description of the suspect:

&gt; ""The person who placed these bombs wore a face mask, glasses, a grey hooded sweatshirt, gloves, and black and light grey Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo. The suspect used a backpack to transport each of the devices.

Unfortunately, the trail seems to have grown a bit cold. The Associated Press [reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/capitol-riot-suspects-sought-fbi-year-82084855) this week that ""investigators have interviewed more than 900 people, collected 39,000 video files and examined more than 400 leads"" but are yet to turn up a suspect. Many news reports suggest that the FBI is turning to gait analysis and looking into the Nike shoes that the suspect wore to try and identify them. Despite so much visual evidence (and a joint FBI-ATF reward of $100,000) out there, there remain key questions that are unanswered--such as the suspect's gender, or whether or not the pipe bombs were even connected to the violence of the next day. One year later, it seems that we're still very far from answering the question as to who is responsible for the attempted bombings of the DNC and RNC.

Beginning in May 1940, three dismembered bodies were found in abandoned train cars in nearby McKees Rocks. The following two years would see 5 more dismembered bodies found either on nearby train tracks or floating in the rivers. These murders were strikingly similar to those of the Cleveland Torso Killer who is regarded to have stopped killing just one year prior. Elliott Ness and other Cleveland detectives did come down to look into the first three murders but they were never officially linked. Of the eight murders, none have been solved.

Two years after the 1989 murder of Anthony Michalowski, the body of Michael Hickmott was found dismembered and thrown in various trash bins around Pittsburgh's Shadyside neighborhood. 

He was quickly linked to Robert Wayne Marshall, an unemployed man who described himself as a 'neo-nazi vampire' and had disappeared right after the murder. He would commit suicide in an abandoned factory but did not admit anything in his suicide note. With no evidence police could not positively say he committed the murder. The FBI became involved and stated due to the brutal modus operandi, Marshall had almost certainly killed before.

MANCHESTER, N.H. —
An investigation into a missing girl who was last seen in New Hampshire over two years ago has led to the arrest of the child's father, officials announced.

Rewards totaling $33,000 are being offered for information leading to 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery. She was last seen at a Manchester home in October 2019, when she was 5.

Adam Montgomery, 31, was arrested Tuesday on charges including second-degree assault connected to an incident in 2019 involving the missing girl, interference with custody and endangering the welfare of a child. The assault charge is a felony.

""Although an arrest has been made, the search for Harmony continues,"" New Hampshire Attorney General John M. Formella wrote in a statement.

Adam Montgomery waived his arraignment Wednesday in the Hillsborough County Superior Court North. According to an affidavit, he is suspected of hitting her in the face and claimed that he brought her to live with her mother.

Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg said Harmony was in the child welfare system in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. It was New Hampshire's Division of Children, Youth and Families that notified police last week that Harmony was missing and last seen two years ago, the chief said.

A source told WCVB sister station WMUR that Harmony had been reunited with her father after spending time in foster care in Massachusetts.

An affidavit from the case indicates that Harmony's mother called Manchester Police Department to report the girl missing on Nov. 18, 2021. The department contacted DCYF to get contact information about the father, but was unable to find him at the addresses provided.

More than a month later, on Dec. 27, 2021, DCYF contacted police to report they were unable to locate Harmony. The affidavit says that was when the department initiated its investigation.

During the investigation, a detective spoke with Adam Montgomery's uncle. The document says he had first-hand knowledge that Harmony's eye injury was caused by her father in 2019.

Adam Montgomery has three younger children with his current wife and all were accounted for by investigators. The document indicates that he had not been living with his wife since late October.

Investigators wrote that they found Adam Montgomery sleeping in a car with his new girlfriend in Manchester on New Year's Eve. In subsequent interviews, the affidavit indicates that the father made contradictory statements about his missing daughter or refused to answer.

According to the Essex District Attorney's Office, Adam Montgomery has a prior criminal history in Massachusetts. The DA's office confirmed to NewsCenter 5 that in March of 2014, Montgomery was charged in Haverhill District Court with shooting a Haverhill man in the head after he came to the city to buy drugs. Police charged Montgomery with armed robbery and armed assault to murder in connection with the incident, which happened the night of Jan. 24, 2014. He was also charged with carrying a firearm without a license and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building.

Authorities said Adam Montgomery pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced on Sept. 9, 2014, and he was sentenced to serve 18 months in the Middleton House of Correction.

Manchester police have created a dedicated tip line for the search for Harmony. Anyone with information is asked to call or text 603-203-6060.

""Help us find this little girl,"" Aldenberg said. ""Someone knows something. Do what is right and call in. I cannot emphasize this enough. Someone out there knows something.""

On Sunday, Manchester police searched a home at 77 Gilford St. in Manchester, which is where Montgomery used to live. Aldenberg said the owner of that home has no involvement in the case, but noted she has been cooperative with police and has assisted them in their investigation.

A person who saw the search said that a police dog went through the home and did not find anything. That same person also said police dug up a corner of the yard, but they did not appear to find anything.

Investigators said they think Harmony has blond hair, blue eyes and is blind in her right eye, so she may be wearing glasses.

Aldenberg said Monday that Manchester police are treating this case as a rescue mission and not a recovery mission.

""For now, we have to operate under the assumption that she is alive and well somewhere, and that somebody knows something,"" he said.[Article](https://www.wcvb.com/article/missing-harmony-montgomery-investigation-arrest-adam-montgomery-new-hampshire-jan-5-2022/38674178)",UnresolvedMysteries,Father of missing New Hampshire child Harmony Montgomery arrested,0

297,Bunnystrawbery,1641420744,"The Fouke Monster first made local headlines in 1971, when it was reported to have attacked the home of Bobby and Elizabeth Ford on May 2, 1971.

According to Elizabeth Ford, the creature, which she initially thought was a bear, reached through a screen window that night while she was sleeping on a couch. It was chased away by her husband and his brother Don. During the alleged encounter, the Fords fired several gun shots at the creature and believed that they had hit it, though no traces of blood were found. An extensive search of the area failed to locate the creature, but three-toed footprints were found close to the house, as well as scratch marks on the porch and damage to a window and the house's siding. According to the Fords, they had heard something moving around outside late at night several nights prior but, having lived in the house for less than a week, had never encountered the creature before.

The creature was allegedly sighted again on May 23, 1971, when three people, D. C. Woods, Jr., Wilma Woods, and Mrs. R. H. Sedgass, reported seeing an ape-like creature crossing U.S. Highway 71. More sightings reports were made over the following months by local residents and tourists, who found additional footprints. The best known footprints were found in a soybean field belonging to local filling station owner Scott Keith. They were scrutinized by game warden Carl Galyon, who was unable to confirm their authenticity. Like the Ford prints, they appeared to indicate that the creature had only three toes.

The incident began to attract substantial interest after news spread about the Ford sighting. The Little Rock, Arkansas, radio station KAAY posted a $1,090 bounty on the creature. Several attempts were made to track the creature with dogs, but they were unable to follow its scent. When hunters began to take interest in the Fouke Monster, Miller County Sheriff Leslie Greer was forced to put a temporary ""no guns"" policy in place in order to preserve public safety. In 1971, three people were fined $59 each ""for filing a fraudulent monster report.""

After an initial surge of attention, public interest in the creature decreased until it gained national recognition in 1973 when Charles B. Pierce released a docudrama horror film about the creature in 1972, The Legend of Boggy Creek.

By late 1974, interest had waned again and sightings all but stopped; only to begin again in March 1978 when tracks were reportedly found by two brothers prospecting in Russellville, Arkansas. There were also sightings in Center Ridge, Arkansas. On June 26 of that same year, a sighting was reported in Crossett, Arkansas. During this period the creature was blamed for missing livestock and attacks on several dogs.

“After \[the juror’s\] clear, repeated expressions of actual bias as to the precise nature of the allegations at the heart of this trial and evidence which would be introduced, we cannot conclude that juror \[number\] 40 was sufficiently rehabilitated such that Talbott was provided a fair and impartial jury.”

The court’s ruling included transcripts from portions of voir dire, where the juror referenced growing up in a violent household.

“I don’t know how I would feel, being shown evidence of something that could bring up memories that I have worked to get rid of,” said the juror. “I also have a daughter, and I think that might also play a part in how I might feel. If there was some action taken towards a young woman, I might take that personally and not be able to be impartial.”

Jurors heard the violent and gruesome details behind the murders for which Talbott was accused.

According to court records, Cook and Cuylenborg left Victoria, British Columbia, on Nov. 18, 1987, to retrieve furnace parts in Seattle for Cook’s father. On Nov. 24, Cuylenborg’s body was discovered on a steep embankment in a rural area of Skagit County. Her pants were removed, and her bra pulled above her breasts. Someone beat her and shot her in the back of the head at close range.

The following day, the couple’s van was found with blood evidence and Cuylenborg’s missing pants inside.

On Nov. 26, 1987, Cook’s partially covered body was found in a rural area in Snohomish County. He sustained blunt force trauma to the head and was strangled to death with a dog collar and twine. The killer also shoved a pack of cigarettes down his throat.

Investigators collected DNA from the van and Cuylenborg’s body.

In 2018, investigators tested the DNA using genetic genealogy, an up-and-coming science that was still relatively new at the time. The testing, made famous with the ultimate capture of [Golden State Killer](https://www.oxygen.com/all/golden-state-killer) Joseph DeAngelo that same year, helps law enforcement create suspect profiles through familial DNA links developed using genetic genealogy databases. Talbott was identified as a possible source.

Investigators tailed him and collected a coffee cup he discarded, ultimately tying him to the murders.

Talbott, a construction worker and truck driver who lived near where Cook’s body was found, was arrested at a job site in May 2018. He was [sentenced](https://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/william-talbott-ii-sentenced-life-slaying-jay-cook-tanya-van-cuylenborg) to life in prison.

Monday’s decision to overturn the murder convictions came as a shock to prosecutors, according to [KOMO News](https://komonews.com/news/local/cold-case-murder-convictions-surprisingly-overturned-after-appeal).

“We’re disappointed as an office, to say the least, and I’m sure the family is similarly disappointed,” said Snohomish County Prosecuting Attorney Adam Cornell. “The fact that the trial court did not dismiss that juror for cause impacted Mr. Talbott’s right to a fair trial, and here we are.”

Cornell said he plans to appeal the state Supreme Court before a Jan. 5, 2022 deadline, according to the Seattle-based news outlet. Failing that, his office will attempt to re-try Talbott.

“This isn’t over yet,” said Cornell. “We’re going to continue to fight for justice for these families.”",UnresolvedMysteries,First Man Convicted Of Murder On Genetic Genealogy Evidence Has Verdict Overturned,0

306,eastofliberty,1641338696,"The Toronto Star has been granted court-approved access to police investigative documents in the now four-year-old unsolved Barry and Honey Sherman Murder case, and the documents are released in chronological order, not all at once. Last week, we reported that homicide detectives in 2019 had compiled a list of cell phone numbers of “key persons” in the case and that they were seeking court approval to get a tower.”dump’ of all mobile communications surrounding Barry and Honey the night they died, hoping to match up with a stalker. In today’s episode, the Star reveals what the police learned in 2020 and where the investigation went.

In September 2020, the Toronto Police Department investigating the murders of the two billionaires used terms such as “walking man” and “killer” in their investigation notes, describing the belief that an unknown “man” with an unusual gait was their prime suspect.

As described in the search warrant and production order requests that police made to obtain cell phone tracking data, detectives now had a “working theory.”

“The theory is that investigators believe that both Bernard and Honey Sherman were murdered and that the perpetrator, presumably a man, is referred to as the ‘walking man’. that can be seen on video surveillance” was their prime suspect, one detective wrote in a request to the court for permission to conduct additional analyzes of mobile communications data.

“Any patterns emerging could reveal that the Shermans were under surveillance prior to their murders or could reveal the identity of the ‘running man’,” police wrote.

Barry Sherman, founder of pharmaceutical company Apotex, and his wife Honey were murdered in their home in Toronto between 9 p.m. and midnight on Wednesday, December 13, 2017. Their bodies were discovered 36 hours later by a real estate agent who showed the house. Once police moved from a homicide-suicide theory to double homicide (six weeks into the case), investigators focused on a series of video footage collected from neighborhood cameras that showed a man walking to the Sherman property and “suspicious” amount. time there, and then leave the same way he had come. Investigative files released by a court reveal that police believe this is Sherman’s “murderer”.

The identity of the walking man remains a mystery to this day.

At a police press conference in December, Det. Sergeant Brandon Price told the media using a technique known as: “photogrammetry” they had determined that the person was between five and a half meters tall. What Price didn’t tell the media is that according to police documents, it took nearly two years to estimate the person’s height, an analysis that took just two weeks. Photogammetry uses known objects in an area (a tree, fire hydrant, etc.) and other factors to estimate the height and weight of a person captured on video or photograph.

As the newly released documents describe, police theorized that the walking man was in mobile communications with people who were “key persons” in the case. Or that the walking man was in mobile communication with a nearby intermediary who in turn was in contact with an interested party. The documents do not indicate the possibility that the individual communicated via a two-way mobile radio, which would not be picked up by a cell tower.

To understand how the Toronto Police Department investigated this case, set aside images from detective shows such as the Baltimore Police Drama. Murder life on the street, or the British police procedural show Scott &amp; Bailey, with scenes of detectives pounding the sidewalk and knocking on doors. The only full-time detective on the Sherman case, Det. Constable Dennis Yim was charged with investigating cellular communications.

First, they collected about 300 cell phone numbers of the Sherman family, friends, business associates, and people who worked for the Shermans. Those numbers and their names went into a spreadsheet. According to the documents, these were figures that came from various sources. First, interviews the police conducted – detectives asked people for their cell phone numbers or the number of people the interviewee speculated had committed the murders. Declassified documents show that the Sherman family and some friends pointed the finger at three individuals who were not named in the documents (police say they have found no evidence that these individuals were involved). Police also received 18 cell phone numbers from tips the public gave directly to the Toronto Police Department; 41 issues from tips to a committed Sherman murder line that put the police on the case for a year; and 184 numbers relayed by the Sherman family’s private investigation team led by criminal defense attorney Brian Greenspan.

Then, in early 2019, police went to Ontario Court of Justice Judge Leslie Pringle asking for permission to obtain: “tower dumps” from Bell, Telus, Rogers and Freedom Mobile for areas around Sherman’s and Apotex’s home the night of the murders, as well as weeks and in some cases months prior to the murders. How this works is relatively simple: when a cell phone is used to make a call or receive a text message, it communicates with a nearby cell tower, creating a ‘handshake’. This data is specific to an area – think of drawing an invisible electronic box around a property or part of the street.

As the recently declassified September 2020 documents show, the police warrant was granted on the condition that the police use strict protocol to preserve the privacy of innocent people whose mobile communication patterns were picked up during the massive tower collapse.

The next step was to run a comparison of those about 300 “person of interest” numbers and the tower dump. This was at least a partial success. Sometime in 2020, the police began to get “hits” – persons of interest appeared in the tower dumps.

That prompted the police to conduct “background investigations … on the telephone numbers, from telephone records obtained through production order, that were common for the results of the tower dump’s transmission data.”


 
It is likely that most if not all of these figures found in the “tower dumps” are people innocent of the crime but who happened to be in the area at the time. What the documents don’t reveal (due to redactions) is whether police identified “pings” to cell towers that approximate the “walking man” movements and whether those pings match the long list of “key people.”

The term “important persons” is a term the police use to describe, quite literally, someone “important” in a case, but not someone who is a suspect. Police need evidence of suspected crime to raise the status to ‘suspicious’, which they recently did with the unknown ‘walking man’.

The police documents have been heavily redacted in the portions describing these hits – all persons of interest showing up in the tower dumps have been obscured.

Of additional interest in the newly released documents is the fact that something the police discovered in the tower dumps prompted them to make a comparison with information the police received in an international production order they obtained in 2020. The Canadian Police Service, through the federal government, can collect information overseas with 35 countries covered by what is known as a “mutual legal assistance treaty”.

The latest page of police documents released to the Star on Monday has a completely blacked-out section with the headline: “Relevant results from legal aid treaties.”

From the Star’s ongoing investigation, which includes reviewing more than 1,000 pages of documents that have been released, police theorize that the walking man or anyone he communicated with was outside Canada at the time, or left Canada after the murders.

With each new batch of documents released, more information comes out about the case, including the crime scene.

In these newly declassified documents, designated by the police as ITOs #11 and #12 (an ITO is an “information to obtain a search warrant or a production warrant”, we get a clearer picture of the crime scene than in previous declassified documents). For the first time, the belts looped around the Sherman’s neck are identified as “black belts.”

Their arms were behind them and their bodies were held up by black belts wrapped around their necks and tied to a railing about “three feet (just under a meter) above the pool’s deck. The documents show that the Shermans stood with their backs to the pool, their feet almost against the wall on one side of the pool. Barry’s wrists were “tied up” at one point, but no ties or other shackles were found at the crime scene.

The documents also reveal for the first time a reference to “bloodstains on the victims,” ​​an observation by a forensic officer that is not explained further. De Star has learned from her own research that the blood at the scene was relatively small, most likely coming from Honey’s nose as a result of the “ligature compression” on her neck that killed her. Honey had a small spot on her right eye. Barry had no markings on his face and his glasses sat neatly on his nose. Both Shermans were wearing their shoes.

And police have also revealed that Honey’s last known email was sent sometime on Wednesday night the Shermans died, a harmless request to mydrap.com, a supplier of cotton napkins, asking if they ship products to both Canada and the U.S. to ship. Honey was known for his fun functions with family and friends during the holiday season.

ATLANTA — The cold case of an Atlanta 14-year-old who was raped and murdered has been solved by homicide investigators almost 26 years later.
On June 7, 1995, Nacole Smith was killed in the woods on the way to school in southwest Atlanta. Police said a man sexually assaulted her and shot her twice in the face.
Atlanta investigators announced Tuesday that the suspect has finally been identified.


Using genealogy and forensic technology, the cold case unit connected the DNA of Nacole’s alleged killer to a man who died in hospice care of liver and kidney failure in August 2021.
Nacole’s mother said she will always live knowing she didn’t get to confront her daughter’s killer.
“I never imagined this person would be deceased. So many unanswered questions I had for him,” Acquenellia Smith said. “I’ll live with this pain for the rest of my life. Just take it one day a time. There’s nothing more I can say right now. My feelings are all over the place. There’s not a pill that can take that pain away.”
Police said at the news conference that they would not release the suspect’s name because they do not want to give his name any relevance.
Former detectives who worked the case and investigators credited the bravery of a 13-year-old victim who was raped by the suspect nine years later in 2004.
The East Point girl was pulled into the woods, raped and escaped. She was able to give detectives a description of the man for a composite sketch.
The victim identified herself Tuesday as Betty Brown. Brown said she never thought she would be speaking but didn’t want to hide or live in pain anymore.
“He is no longer out there able to do the things that he did to me and Nacole and to others,” Brown said.
Brown added that she felt conflicted about the outcome and doesn’t want to let her rape control her life anymore.
But she also wants the suspect’s family to know the pain that her family felt for the past 18 years.
“To know the man who you loved, you respected did something so horrible to me and Nacole, I want you to live in that. I want you to wear that like I did. Like I do every day of my life,” Brown said.
“I’m mad I didn’t get that opportunity to face him and look him in his eyes.”

Retired Atlanta police Detective Vince Velazquez worked both Smith and Brown’s cases.

He said the department and East Point police put a lot of effort and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars into identifying the suspect.
Velazquez said they put the composite sketch on “America’s Most Wanted” and billboards and spoke with hundreds of people around the country.
Velazquez worked the case until his retirement in 2017. Detective Scott Demeester took over the case and said it took three years to find a person of interest and get his DNA.
The final breakthrough came through around Christmas 2021. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s forensics team matched the DNA profile to the suspect in both rapes.
“I was just glad to be able to make that phone call to Mrs. Smith. It was an emotional phone call,” Demeester said.
Velazquez and Demeester kept in touch with Brown and Smith’s family throughout the years.
“I thank you detectives for sticking with me through all these years, checking on me and making sure I’m OK. I appreciate you because I needed that,” Brown told investigators.",UnresolvedMysteries,"Cold case rape, murder of Atlanta 14-year-old solved with help from suspect’s other victim",0
314,MaddiKate,1641325542,"Hello, I am back with a major update on the disappearance of Kyrstyn Dunlap-Bosse. I wrote about her case approx. two months ago, which you can read about in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qyio13/the_1994_disappearance_of_krystyn_dunlapbosse/). The tl;dr is that the Boise teenager was involved in an abusive, inappropriate relationship with a man 10 years her senior, Chares ""Corey"" Castro. Krystyn ran away from home in October 1994, but kept contact with her friends until mid-Dec 1994, when she vanished after taking a trip with Castro. 

In the time since Krystyn disappeared, Castro was charged and convicted of a sexual offense towards another minor in 1998. Since then, he has been a convicted sex offender. Up until yesterday, he was living on a ranch in rural Murphy, Idaho. He and his then-wife owned a hobby ranch aimed at children with mental and developmental health concerns (why Castro was allowed around children, even while being compliant, is anyone's guess). There are rumors that he has abused more women and girls and that he and his wife were currently in the process of a divorce.

Yesterday at around 3:30pm, Owyhee County police went to Castro's residence to serve him a civil protection order. It is unclear why, but the local rumor mill believes this has to do with his estranged wife. When the police arrived, Castro allegedly charged at them with a weapon and refused to put the weapon down when ordered. After refusing to put down his weapon, the police shot and killed him. He was 54 years old. This is still a developing story, I will update as more info comes in.

On one hand, I can't say I grieve this man's loss. Even if he had nothing to do with Krystyn's disappearance, he has known victims (with convictions) prior to and after her disappearance (some sexual, some not). On the other hand, it's unfortunate that he likely took whatever happened to Krystyn to his grave.

What is interesting is that, while it is believed that the protection order has to do with his ongoing divorce, there has been a recent interest in Krystyn's case. Her family and friends spent much of late 2021 bringing her case to the media and providing new details to the public. As recently as two months ago, Castro told the media that he was cleared by a polygraph test. His death comes at an interesting time.

315,Bottle_of_fantaa,1641314933,"So, I’m currently on the bus home, and stumbled upon [this article](https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-new-hampshire-girl-harmony-montgomery) 

It honestly shocked me. How can no one report a five year old missing for two years, not even friends of the family noticed she was gone? No one at school? I mean, I guess if she was in pre-school it would be harder to notice her absence. Because I don’t believe pre-school is required for most kids. However, it’s still odd.

Sadly, I do think she’s in a bad, abusive, and/or neglectful family situation seeing that no one has reported her missing. The article does not go into much detail about her home life. However, on the surface that seems to be the case.

A quote from the article states, “Harmony Montgomery was last seen in October 2019 when she was 5 years old, the Manchester Police Department said Friday in a news release. Police said the circumstances of Harmony's long absence ""are very concerning,"" and that detectives have been investigating ""non-stop"" since first learning the child was missing last weeks”

It’s relieving  to know that her disappearance isn’t being swept under the rug by authorities. But it’s still saddening nonetheless 


Harmony Montgomery would currently be seven years old. She wears glasses and is blind in her right eye. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and estimated to be around 4ft tall

317,Flashy_Dragonfly9718,1641294863,"I must post this. A soldier in the military was sleeping with another soldiers wife. She got pregnant, and, I believe, had collaborated with him to murder the husband to collect his $400,000 life insurance. I was a young student at the time and not till years later did I see it. It was their eyes that gave them away. I walked in to a place well frequented by local police and saw the ""new"" couple there. Their eyes wide displaying fear. You don't see those eyes often, they are very rare, so when you do they are etched perfectly in your mind. Why would they fear me? I barely knew them. I didn't find out any of the details until later. The husband and new boyfriend went on a hike, a place known for people to fall from, since it was on a mountain whose trail was hugged by cliffs. He ... fell. Of course the police wouldn't properly investigate, again it was at a local law enforcement place that I saw them, interacting with the police as if they are we all friends.

I know what those two did. I have thought of telling the family, but I do not know them and it will only bring up more pain for them, and I have no proof. I cant tell the police for obvious reasons. How can I proof him ""losing his footing"" versus forceful push off the trial. How can I proof the motive of $400,000 and illegitimate child. I can tell you this, when you know someone has done wrong, it stays with you, years later bubbling to the surface. I know because I have seen your eyes stare at me today, as I though I have caught you that day.

The body of Patricia Cavallaro, 57, a resident of the Los Angeles suburb of Bellflower, was discovered on Oct. 24, 1994, in the Thousand Palms area in Riverside County. Her remains were eventually linked to her son after a DNA match, the [Desert Sun](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2022/01/03/la-county-woman-missing-30-years-identified-das-investigators/9057008002/) reported. 

**Patricia Cavallaro, 57, has been identified as a woman found partially buried in the California desert nearly three decades ago, authorities said Monday.**  **(Riverside County District Attorney's Office )**

At the time of her discovery, investigators with the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department were unable to ID Cavallaro, the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office said. An autopsy determined that she died from homicidal violence. 

""Because authorities were unable at the time to identify the victim and due to a lack of leads into what may have happened, this became a cold case,"" the DA's office said in a statement. 

Investigators determined that she was killed elsewhere and buried in the desert, citing a lack of evidence near where she was found. 

In an effort to identify Cavallaro, her DNA was entered into the state Justice Department Missing and Unidentified Persons System. 

After being unable to find a match, the District Attorney's Office's Regional Cold Case Homicide Team took over the investigation. A team sent a sample of the remains to a laboratory in Texas. 

Using her genetic information, investigators tracked down Cavallaro's son, who provided a DNA sample. An analysis indicated the remains were most likely his mother's. 

Cavallaro's husband reported her missing in 2001, telling police she ""walked away"" and was never seen again, the newspaper reported. He died in 2017.

On January 1st, 2013, a passerby walking his dog in the morning discovers a horrific sight: a dead body, right next to one of the houses on the Berghemseweg in the Dutch town of Oss. It quickly becomes apparent that she has become the victim of a crime. Nobody in the area seems to know who the dead woman is, and it takes a few days before she is identified as Marja Nijholt, a 48-year-old woman from the Dutch city of Enschede, who only arrived in Oss a day earlier. But why did she end up in Oss, over 100km (or a 2-hour train ride) away from her home? As the police investigates the timeline of this murder, they discover an intricate and curious case… 

&amp;#x200B;

The murder of Marja Nijholt, also dubbed the “New Year’s Murder”, puzzled law enforcement and civilians alike. After 18 months, the investigation was dialed way back in 2014, until a civilian initiative formed in 2020 pooled their efforts to help the police solve the case. The civilian collective, called Bureau Dupin after Edgar Allan Poe’s detective character, has since been working together with law enforcement to find a breakthrough in the case. The Bureau, fronted by former cop and data science professor Peter de Kock, has since investigated thousands of phone calls, text messages and has produced a 6-part podcast discussing the mysterious murder of Marja Nijholt. Their work, most notably said podcast, has been a huge help in creating this write-up. 

&amp;#x200B;

There already was a write-up on this case a few years ago, but seeing all the work Bureau Dupin has done, as well as the fact this is a fascinating case, I think another discussion about it is very much in place. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Knowing Marja Nijholt**

*Note: taken nearly in full from Bureau Dupin podcast*

Marja grew up with a brother and a sister, but at a young age her parents divorced. The role of her biological mother Kristel was filled by her new stepmom, Gemma. Soon, another sister was born. Kristel describes young Marja as “very calm, sweet child. She needed a lot of love.” Kristel eventually came out as lesbian, however this only caused a rift between her and her former husband, causing her to have less contact with Marja and her siblings. Marja’s sister Ellen: “My father made sure \[Kristel\] would not see her children anymore. Soon enough, he found love in my new mother, but Marja saw her as an intruder of sorts”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stepmother Gemma talks about the first time she met little Marja: “The first time I met Marja, she looked a bit scared. She cared a lot about making the atmosphere, but she had to do it her way”. Eventually, Marja’s dad lost his job, and Marja, who looked for a lot of love and attention, started to struggle. Ellen: “She always tried so hard to be seen in a positive light. Studying, buying gifts, practicing her talents. But she never quite achieved what she wanted.”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Marja is sweet, caring and talented, but another side of her develops as she grows up. She feels things other people don’t, and that makes her angry, lonely and scared. Ellen: “Eventually, you could see that Marja no longer knew what was and wasn’t normal in terms of interacting with other people. For example, she called 100 times a day, and when we blocked the phone, she’d just keep showing up at the door”. She became manic-depressive and fearful and developed schizophrenia. According to her biological mother, Marja wasn’t the first in the family to have psychiatric issues. Marja would wind up being admitted to a psychiatric ward multiple times. The behaviour she would later display in her final hours, could very well fit her psychiatric issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the years went on, Marja spent less time with her family, but more time with her partner, Steef. “We met in Tilburg when I was 26 and Marja was 20. At the time, I rode a motorbike, we met each other through a motorcycle club. Marja ended up getting into an art academy, which is how we ended up \[in Enschede\]. We both needed a lot of space, so we decided to each get our own place, in the same neighborhood”. Steef talks about how he and Marja would usually spend the final days of the year: “Usually, I had friends coming over to celebrate the end of the year with pyrotechnics. That’s a bit too loud and too busy for Marja. The past few years, she had spent New Year’s Eve with her family, and that’s what she was going to do \[in 2012\] as well”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Marja used to be on benefits, and according to Steef, could have trouble managing her money. He talks about a nice man from Marja’s church, who would help her out, with money or advice. However, like with many other people, Marja could easily get mad at this man, despite having good intentions. Sometimes she even paints him as the devil. Bureau Dupin found this man, named Hennie. He says: “I gave her the love she sought for. No, I wasn’t her dad, or her lover, just someone who wanted to help.” He even makes sure she can take a holiday to France. “But usually, she came back with problems. She couldn’t adjust”. However, as said, Marja doesn’t always appreciate him, and sometimes sends angry letters or e-mails. Despite this, Hennie does not hold it against her: “This was not feigned. In spirit, she truly was a good woman.”

&amp;#x200B;

Religion and spirituality also played a big part in Marja’s life. According to Steef, she was always on a quest to find what fit her, which involved quite some changes in religion and beliefs. Eventually, she ended up at a Pentecostal Church. “I didn’t fully approve, but I supported her”. This church and its members seem to have played a big part in Marja’s final months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marja’s last days: what do we know and why did she end up in Oss?** 

***A map of the locations mentioned in this section can be found here:***  [https://imgur.com/TSvDZtH](https://imgur.com/TSvDZtH)

The brief history leading directly to Marja’s death starts in the morning of December 29th, 2012. It is this morning that she decides to leave behind her hometown Enschede and crosses the border to stay in a hotel in the German town of Gronau. While this might seem like quite a move, it should be noted that both Enschede and Gronau are very close to the border, mere kilometers apart – both cities are within biking distance of one another. She stays in the hotel for two nights. The owner would eventually tell Bureau Dupin that Marja did not seem to make a panicked impression at first, he noticed “not everything was right” as her stay went on. He says Marja had said she fled, and mentioned “God, and priests, and the devil – I don’t quite know”. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the morning of December 31st of 2012, an unknown man calls the hotel Marja is staying at, and asks for her. The owner of the hotel tells the caller that he can’t share this information, however, he does inform Marja of this phone call. She panics, and leaves the hotel right away. Around 11AM that morning, she is seen back at the train station of Enschede, along with her bike, a grey suitcase, a backpack and a little purse. Instead of going back home, however, she buys a one-way ticket to the city of Oss. 

&amp;#x200B;

But why would she end up in Oss, of all places? Obviously, for people not from the Netherlands, city names barely mean anything. People know of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, if at all. It might be good to know a bit more about Oss and other cities in the Netherlands. For example, Oss is not at all a big or prominent city. The “big four” cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague (Den Haag) and Utrecht. However, none of them are in the same province as Oss. But even in that province – North Brabant – there are other, bigger cities such as Eindhoven, Breda, Den Bosch and even Tilburg, where Marja and her partner had met. In addition to this, the train ride from Enschede to Oss takes about two hours and involves at least one change of trains. If Marja was trying to outright flee the country, would she take this route, only to end up in the not-very-significant city of Oss? 

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the podcasts produced by Bureau Dupin, Marja’s partner at the time of her disappearance suggested a possible reason to visit Oss: according to him, Marja would visit her father for New Year’s Eve, who lives in the town of Udenhout, which is about half an hour away from Oss. However, this does not explain why she would visit the hotel in Gronau first. Other information from Bureau Dupin’s investigation seems to contradict this: they claim that on December 30th, while staying in Gronau, Marja sent a text to her church:

&amp;#x200B;

*“I have become a refugee. I can’t stay in Europe any longer. Warn Rob, he prays for me”*

&amp;#x200B;

This gives no indication that Marja ever intended to spend the last day of 2012 with her father, and did not tell her partner what she was going to do. And Bureau Dupin has even more interesting tidbits to share. According to their investigation into telecom data, the man that called the Gronau hotel to ask for Marja had called the hotel with a phone number that belonged to Marja Nijholt herself. But then who actually called? The only thing the hotel owner can say is that the caller sounded like a man. More on that later. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Marja’s final days, especially during her time in Oss which we will talk about shortly, she made a stressed and fearful impression on those who saw her. She thought she was being followed or even stalked, and whether that’s true or not, it was the reality she lived in. Her partner Steef comments: “Wherever we went, someone was there to watch her. She also said someone was watching *me*, but I never quite found any reason to believe as much. Usually, she couldn’t tell me who was following her, though”. 

&amp;#x200B;

In an interview with Bureau Dupin, Marja’s “good Samaritan” Hennie mentions someone who hadn’t been part of the investigation before: the leader of the Pentecostal Church that Marja had become a part of. Hennie: “He lived in Oss. Marja went there to get help and talk to him. I don’t understand why they didn’t help her out”. Steef supports the theory: “The leader did indeed live in Oss. Marja told me she would visit her father, but it seems that wasn’t her true plan”. Bureau Dupin spoke to some other members of the Pentecostal Church, who say they were informed of Marja’s plans to leave for Oss, and maybe even sleep in the forest. Instead, they convinced her to not do that, and instead she went to Gronau. A man and a woman both mention they had received calls and messages from Marja on December 31st, but they don’t want to mention the names she had mentioned. In the end, they decide to share this information with Bureau Dupin, as long as it is kept secret from the general public. They also reveal they are the recipients of the text message Marja sent on December 30th, as mentioned above. One of them reveals: “Halfway through December 2012, Marja asked me to ask X to call her, and pray for her father. She said God had other intentions for her father”. He refuses to share X’s name, out of privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

A clearer timeline develops. While she didn’t go to her father as she had told Steef, Marja seems to have left Enschede for Gronau on December 29th to escape the chaos of New Years Eve. A day later, she texts her fellow church member to warn X of her situation. Eventually, Bureau Dupin finds out X is named Rob who was mentioned earlier in Marja's text. Could he be the reason Marja travelled to Oss? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Marja’s day in Oss: a timeline**

As we now know, Marja leaves the hotel in Gronau in the morning of December 31st and heads straight from Enschede to Oss. While the exact reason is a secret Marja has taken to her grave, we now know she might’ve chosen Oss in particular to try and meet Rob. Fact is that she ends up at the Oss train station around 2PM on that final day of the year. Below is a timeline of Marja’s final day, based off of the “official” timeline as it was shown in Opsporing Verzocht, a Dutch television show which every week showcases police cases, hoping to engage the audience in finding the culprits. Additional information came from Bureau Dupin’s podcast.

&amp;#x200B;

**2PM**: Marja arrives at the station in Oss. 

**4PM**: Marja arrives at café Libre in the Molenstraat in Oss. Despite this only being a 4 minute walk from the station, Marja takes about two hours. In the meantime, various witnesses report Marja approaching them, asking to use their phones – she says she can’t use her own as she was being spied on – as well as asking for cheap places to spend the night. It later turns out that at least one of these calls was made to Rob. In Café Libre she continues, and mentions she wants to travel to Belgium, as it would be cheaper to stay there. 

**6PM**: Marja leaves the café Libre and does as she did before: she approaches people asking for a place to stay and to use their phone. Pouring rain starts, and continues throughout the night.

**8.30PM**: Marja arrives at cafetaria Oostwal where the owner allows her to make a phone call. He describes her as confused (a Dutch euphemism for “out of her mind”, really) and slightly panicked. Efforts in 2021 to track the number she called, fall flat, as the data is kept for only 7 years. 

**9PM**: Marja leaves cafetaria Oostwal with her bicycle. There is a probable sighting of her at the station of Oss just after 9PM. As it was New Year’s Eve and trains don’t run after 8PM that night, it’s plausible Marja stayed at the station for a bit – as it would be calm. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this Marja isn’t seen until hours later, well into 2013. Her bicycle is never seen after she left cafetaria Oostwal with it. Rob, the man Marja might have been looking for, does recall being called by Marja on December 31st: “Yes, I got a call from someone telling me, hey, I have someone named Marie here who’s asking for you. But I refused to take the call or elaborate. It just didn’t feel right”. He says he did not get a call around the time Marja attempted to call from cafetaria Oostwal.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.45AM, January 1st, 2013:** Marja is seen walking on a big road, the Graafsebaan, in the pouring rain and against traffic. She is walking in the direction of the Berghemseweg, which is where her body would eventually be found. As said, her bicycle has disappeared, but she still carries her suitcase and backpack. 

**3.10AM**: A petrol pump’s CCTV (on the Singel 1940-1945) catches Marja walking. She has continued from the Berghemseweg onto the Osseweg, which leads out of Oss into the neighbouring town of Berghem (confusing, I know). 

**4.30AM to 6.15AM**: Marja is seen multiple times in the town of Berghem. She is tired and now asks people how to get to the train station. The nearest train station however is the station back in Oss, where she arrived the previous day. It means she has to turn around and follow the Osseweg again, this time back to Oss. 

**6.30AM**: This marks the final time Marja is caught on camera, walking on the Osseweg.

**6.55AM**: Marja’s last sighting by a witness, still on the Osseweg. 

**Just after 7AM**: A local man and woman find an opened suitcase in a park near the Berghemseweg. Later, it turns out this is Marja’s suitcase.

**10.30AM**: A passerby finds Marja’s corpse next to a car parked by a house on the Berghemseweg. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Developments after Marja’s death – the suitcase, the pictures, the phone calls**

The investigation starts. While it goes on for about 18 months, the trail seems to die out in 2014, and the case becomes one of many cold cases, until Bureau Dupin started its investigations. Even identifying the victim already proves a challenge, as it takes multiple days until Marja’s family can identify her. The **crime scene**, of course, also poses multiple questions. Multiple scenarios, including an accident and (attempted) suicide, are investigated. The crime scene is relatively free of blood, despite multiple stab wounds on Marja’s body. While Marja’s partner Steef suggests she might have been killed elsewhere only to be disposed of by the Berghemseweg, it should also be noted that due to the heavy rain, blood might have been washed away. The same is said about the murder weapon: it could be any sharp object, even an object without traces of blood, as they might have been washed away. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after Marja’s death, the aforementioned TV show Opsporing Verzocht shows a timeline of Marja’s final days, and asks for a few specific people, possible **witnesses**, to be identified. They mention a person wearing an Angerfist (i.e. Jason Voorhees) mask, seen on the Berghemseweg around 4.30AM. They also mention a man and a woman in a car, seen (probably) fighting around the crossing of the Berghemseweg and the Goudplevier at 6.30AM. Finally, they ask for a man seen at the station of Oss around 8.15AM: the man, taking a train headed towards the city of Nijmegen, appeared wounded and might be a victim of violence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another point of discussion is Marja’s **suitcase**. It was found just after 7AM in a park near the Berghemseweg, opened, with items scattered around. The witnesses described it as if “it had been thrown around”. Despite the heavy rainfall of that night, the items were barely wet, which could indicate the suitcase hadn’t been there and opened for a long while, as the rain had mostly ceased by this time. One of the witnesses, Lia, also walked by the spot Marja would eventually be found – however, she didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. While it could just mean she did not see Marja’s body, it begs the question whether or not Marja’s body was already in its place at this point in time, just after 7AM. 

&amp;#x200B;

During Bureau Dupin’s investigation, the police released a few **pictures** taken at the crime scene as Marja was found. An interesting find was a laptop, which means that a robbery might not be as likely. Some of the Dupin investigators theorized that Marja’s position was not “natural”, ie that her body could have very well been put in its place instead of ending up there without being moved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Bureau Dupin investigated a few tens of thousands **phone calls**. Since they are not actual police officers, law enforcement had to “pseudo-anonymize” all the data, giving each phone a number on its own. Soon enough, multiple phones were marked as interesting or atypical. Two phones were marked as belonging to Marja, while a witness from her church claimed that she had at least 4. While the police could not verify whether those phones belonged to Marja or not, they did call it a “very reasonable assumption”. 

&amp;#x200B;

The goal, of course, was to get an insight into the infamous phone call that caused Marja to leave the hotel in Gronau. While the police again could not verify, the Bureau Dupin team found reason to think that a phone labeled “9104” belonged to the hotel in Gronau. Three phone calls were made to this hotel in Marja’s final days. The first of these came from a phone labeled “147” in the southeast part of Amsterdam, a call made on the morning of December 29th. Another call lasting only 10 seconds was made on December 30th, coming from phone “11028”, located in the town of Losser, near Gronau in the Netherlands. The final call was made from phone “5735” just before 1PM on December 31st. 

&amp;#x200B;

The final phone call was quickly dismissed, as Marja had already checked out of her hotel at that time, and was on her way to Oss. The first phone call made by phone 147 became a point of interest, especially as the phone had no single other appearance in the web of telecom data that was investigated. However, the phone call was made at 8.35AM on the 29th of December. Not only was this two days before Marja actually left – Marja hadn’t even checked into the hotel that early on the 29th! That only leaves the call made on the 30th, coming from phone 11028. This call, too, was not made on the 31st (i.e. the day Marja got scared and left her hotel). Another interesting detail is, that… phone 11028 was said to belong to **Marja Nijholt herself!** 

&amp;#x200B;

So why did Marja’s phone make a call to the hotel on the 30th, during her stay there? And what happened to the phone call on the morning of the 31st that supposedly scared Marja away, as this is nowhere to be found in the Dupin investigation? The phone call perhaps remains the biggest mystery in this case. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other curiosities**

As the Bureau Dupin podcast released its episodes, a listener called in with a very interesting perspective. He referenced a Dutch crime thriller book, released in 2011, with eerie similarities to Marja’s case. For example, the main character was described as creative, a piano player, and had a familiar history of schizophrenia – all of which apply to Marja. Another character lived in fear of being murdered. The story is also set in the same area that Marja lived in, around Enschede. Now this is where it gets real weird: one of the chapters of the books shows the character escaping to Germany, more specifically Gronau, where she stays in the EXACT SAME HOTEL Marja would end up staying at, mere days before her death. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions by the police, by Bureau Dupin and by us**

The questions the official police “cold case” webpage asks are as follows; 

\- Who has been a witness of the murder of Marja Nijholt on January 1st, 2013 between 6.55AM and 10.20AM?

\- Who knows where Marja was between December 31st 9PM and January 1st, 3AM?

\- Who has seen Marja at any other times this night?

\- Who knows where Marja was between 6.55AM and 10.20AM on January 1st, 2013?

\- Who knows what happened in the little park adjacent to the Berghemseweg between these times?

\- Who has seen Marja on the Berghemseweg, possibly in the company of other people?

\- Who has found the item used to kill Marja? (NOTE: due to heavy rain, it could be free of blood stains)

\- Who knows where Marja’s bicycle is?

\- Who has information about this case that they haven’t shared with law enforcement yet?

Other things to think about include:

\- Who was behind the call that scared Marja away from her hotel? Do we know the full truth about this call?

\- Was Marja’s fear for her life grounded, and was she chased? Or was this merely a product of her psychiatric issues, and was she a victim of circumstance?

\- Where did Marja spend the hours between 9AM and 2.45AM the night of her death? She might have stayed at the station, but she might have also found a roof to stay under for a few hours. In either case, why did she re-appear in the middle of the night? 

Hope you are as captivated by this case as I am. Wonder what you all think. This was quite a bit of work, but very interesting, so if the interest is there, perhaps I’ll look into more Dutch cold cases.

This happened very close to where I grew up, in southern-ontario, Canada. It's a shot in the dark but, I'm just curious to know if anyone here has heard anything about it.

Noreen Anne Greenley (b. May 16, 1950)

Disappeared on September 14, 1963, aged 13.

The evening of her disappearance, Noreen Greenley was bowling at the Liberty Bowl on Baseline Rd, Bowmanville, with her friend, Bonnie Wilkins, and Bonnie’s boyfriend, Gary Woolner. After bowling, they went to Sam’s Restaurant (14 Division St.) and then on to Bonnie’s house at the corner of Waverly Rd and King St./Hwy 2 (now “Old” King St, since Hwy 2 was later re-routed further north). Bonnie reported to police and the newspapers that she and Gary wanted to spend time alone, so Noreen left to catch the 11:30 PM westbound bus for home at the stop across the street (again, at the corner of Waverly &amp; King St/Hwy 2). After waiting a short time, Noreen returned to the Wilkins house, spoke more with Bonnie before leaving again to catch the bus.

She did not catch the bus and was not seen again after leaving the Wilkins house the second time.

A Ford Prefect or Renault automobile was reported by a neighbour in the vicinity of the bus stop around the same time, occupied by a man in a fedora. Noreen’s sister, Joyce, encountered the same vehicle around the same time that night on Holt Rd, near the Greenley family home, speeding by her and a friend. The two reported hearing a scream from the car, suspected to have been Noreen. Noreen’s father and brother attempted to follow the car, but could not locate it, unaware Noreen may have been inside.

A massive search took place in the days following Noreen’s disappearance, which turned up no trace of her.  
The Greenley family has never lost hope that they would one day learn the truth about what happened to Noreen. Durham Regional Police continues to list the case file as open.

If you don\`t know this case: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance\_of\_Trevor\_Deely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Trevor_Deely)

Trevor Deely was last seen on CCTV footage. GARDA released the footage in 2017 (17 years later) after it was enhanced. But the footage is incomplete with missing parts that can contain important details. 

The release of full footage by GARDA is very important in solving this case. 

It\`s horrible for his family not knowing what happened for such a long time.

Maybe you think Trevor disappeared a long time ago, but remember what Trevor\`s family said: *'The easiest attitude is to say he's gone... but he deserves more than that'*

And don\`t forget: *'Great things are done by a series of small things brought together. '* \-  Vincent Van Gogh

330,_heidster,1641224317,"Hi All!

I have only done a handful of write-ups, but I like to keep tabs on interesting missing persons around me and I keep seeing Kirsten's name on social media but I haven't seen it pop up on Reddit yet. I wanted to share it because yesterday marked a year since she went missing from Indianapolis.

**Date, Time, &amp; Location:** January 2, 2021 12-2am. Shortridge Rd. in Indianapolis.

Kirsten Bruggeman, daughter of Rex and Lisa Bruggeman, went out with her friends to The Irish Mutt on the evening of January 1, 2021. Her mother typically picked her up from work, but that day she had called her mom to say she was going out with friends after work and would not need a ride. She then had no contact with her parents from that point forward. The next time her mom would try to reach her was around 12:30am and her phone had been shut off, and the call was forwarded to voicemail.

Kirsten is described as a fun person who had a heart for animals. Her father said in an interview that she would do just about anything to help dogs, cats, or any other animal. A caucasian, 26-year old, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was 5' 2"" and weighed 115lbs. She was last seen in a black coat, blue jeans, a gray stocking cap, with a white backpack.

That night she was at a locally owned pub and eatery with her friends on 10th street in Indianapolis, at 12:15am she told them she wanted to go bowling and left the pub in the direction of the bowling alley. At 2am she is caught on video footage of the YMCA on Shortridge Rd, Indianapolis. The YMCA is on the way to the only 24-hour bowling alley in the greater Indianapolis area, but this YMCA is only an 8 minute walk from the bar so there is roughly an hour and a half of unaccounted time in the timeline. The Beech Grove bowling alley is a 2 hour walk from the pub. When passing the YMCA she was heading in the direction of the bowling alley. \*\*She left the bar on foot, was caught on the footage 2 hours later on foot,we know her mother picks her up from work, and we know her phone was off at 12:30 when her mother tried to call her. Based on this, I have assumed she walked and did not call an Uber or other form of driver.

That video footage is the last time that Kirsten was seen. Her parents have been diligent at doing everything to find her. They have done several interviews, in March they hired a private investigation firm called Lauth Investigations International, a GoFundMe, a facebook page with #FindKirsten (due to reddit's rule I cannot link to their facebook page, but you can find it through the #), and their most recent action was to hold a vigil on September 18, 2021 at the intersection of 10th St. and Shortridge Rd. 40 people showed up to this vigil where they handed out missing flyers for individuals to hand out or hang up in the area and honored the memory of Kristen.

No updates have been released by law enforcement or the private investigators, and the PI has released that nothing has been found by them or LE during searches of the area. The family has announced a $10,000 reward for tips or information that leads to the safe return of Kirsten.

**Interesting note:** I have not found anywhere where the video footage or even a still of the footage has been released. I think this would be a way to jog people's memory of seeing her that evening, but I'm not an investigator so there is probably a reason that has not been released.

**Discrepancies:** Some reports are 12:20am and others are 2am for the time that Kirsten was last seen on video footage. I believe this is because her friends last saw her at 12:15am, while she was seen on the video footage at 2:00am. It seems some reports got these two times confused.

What an incredible effort!


Article: 
Tennessee law enforcement has recovered 150 missing children after a months-long investigation.

The children, between three and 17-years old, were found in three ""two-week blitzes"" throughout the US state.
Five of the children were suspected to be victims of human trafficking, investigators said, and one was rescued as part of a kidnapping probe.
The recoveries are among the largest for recent missions by states to find missing children.

A number of arrests have been made following the probe, officials said.
""I hope this operation changes the course for 150 young lives and leads them to the path of opportunities every child deserves,"" said US Marshal for the Western District of Tennes
The operation, dubbed Volunteer Strong, was launched in the fall of 2020. A total of 240 missing children were identified statewide, inciting the joint effort by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), US Marshals Services and Tennessee Department of Children's Services. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also provided support.
Recovery efforts began in January and 150 children were found within two months.

The circumstances of the recovered children varied widely, authorities said, including children that left home, those living with other family members, and others facing abuse or exploitation.
Tim Burchett, a Tennessee congressman, called the results ""miraculous"".

In all of 2020, a total of 387 children were recovered with assistance from US Marshals. Several other states including Ohio, Virginia, Indiana and Georgia have also launched operations to focus on finding missing children.
Efforts to find the remaining 90 missing children in Tennessee will continue, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said.

Excerpt:

 

*There is no doubt, he added, who is responsible for his sister's disappearance.*

*Despite the years and the death of some of her relatives and people who may have information about her disappearance, Mr. Poprafsky believes a resolution is near and it will be solved soon, he said last year.*

*Mr. Popfrasky noted that Ms. Franolich was staying with her husband's family on Westfall Road in Delanson at the time of her disappearance. Members of the family still live in the red and white, two-story farmhouse on the property, which borders Cross Road.*

*When his sister spoke to him that night, Ms. Franolich did not mention that she was in Middleburgh. He did not know she was in Middleburgh until the next month when he received his phone bill.*

*Her husband Richard was working for Mr. Poprafsky when they lived in Michigan.*

*Mr. Poprafsky, 71, told several stories of Mr. Franolich allegedly harming his wife, including one time when Mr. Franolich allegedly ""dragged her in the street with his car when they lived here.""*

*Mr. Overacker has been investigating the details of the disappearance for several years and was in Middleburgh a few times last year interviewing people about the night Ms. Franolich went missing.*

*The answer is out there, he said.*

*""Some of the family members could put an end to this today and it's absolutely unconscionable for them to remain silent. How they sleep at night is beyond us,"" he said last year.*

*Mr. Overacker has spoken to many people involved in the case, including Ms. Franolich's husband Richard.*

*There are inconsistencies in his story about what happened to Ms. Franolich after October 13, 1986, according to Mr. Overacker.*

*At first, Mr. Franolich said he put his wife on a bus in Schenectady two or three days before Halloween, 1986, Mr. Overacker said. He did not know where she was going but had $280 on her. Then he said he put her on the bus two or three days after October 13. Then he said he put her on a bus on October 14. Mr. Franolich said he was with his wife after October 13, 1986, according to Mr. Overacker. In the four to six weeks prior to her disappearance, the Franolichs lived in several different places including his grandparents, parents, and brother's. They also stayed at the Franolich's property on Westfall and Cross Roads in Delanson.*

*The interviews with Mr. Franolich have been frustrating, Mr. Overacker said.*

*""Richard won't answer the questions. He hides behind his lawyer.""*

*The husband, Mr. Overacker noted, ""refuses to take a polygraph test. Refuses to answer any questions to the police."" As anyone who has watched court drama on television knows, polygraph tests are not admissible in court, but could say whether a person is lying or not.*",UnresolvedMysteries,Upstate NY Woman Missing After 35 Years,0

No timeline has been provided, but reportedly, he vanished from the yard and was never seen again. I am not sure what Nampa looked like in 1980. But in 2022, this area is in one of the rougher parts of town- the area is in a ""food desert"", most of the houses are worn down, and it is hot for gang activity. Indian Creek, which flows through Canyon County and joins to the Snake River, flows by this neighbor's yard. It was suspected that Mack may have drowned in the river. However, his remains have never turned up. His father passed away in 2008, and his mother is still searching for him- though she is reportedly in poor health. 

**Richard ""Ricky"" Ray Barnett** [DOB: 11/26/1979] was a two-year-old boy living in rural Grangeville, ID. Ricky lived primarily with his parents- though I cannot tell if they were together at the time of his disappearance. Ricky was visiting his paternal grandparents, Waldo and Martha McChoard, for two weeks on their property at Hillcrest Farms- which was made up of several hundred acres. On the morning of August 31, 1982, Ricky was last seen playing on a hay wagon while several workers helped deliver chickens to the farm. At some point during this transaction, Ricky went missing. A search party was organized within 15 minutes, and he was called in as a missing person by 10:30 am. This search went on for about four days and included 250 volunteers. Bloodhound dogs tracked his scent to a fence line in the northwest area of the property before they lost his scent. Ricky's disappearance is a bit different from the other two in that there was some suspicion towards the family. Reportedly, Marth and Waldo did not like Ricky's mother for unknown reasons and had expressed wanting someone else to aise him. They have been subjected to multiple interviews and polygraphs over the years, but nothing came of these. I have seen multiple reports that there is suspicion that the McChoards sold Ricky into an underground adoption ring, but I am not sure where this comes from. Ricky's mother is still actively looking for him. His father, Ellis, passed away about a decade ago. At the time of his death, the found a picture of an unidentified young man posed next to a bear that he hunted. The man in the pictures looks like Ricky may look like as an adult, implying that Ellis died believing his son was still alive. This man has since been confirmed to be another man living in Alaska. 

**Jason Keith Cannon** [DOB: 05/07/1980] was a two-year-old boy living with his family in Boise, ID- the state's capitol. On March 16, 1983, Jason was last seeing playing on the front porch with his mother. Reportedly, his mother went inside for a few minutes to look for a jacket for him. When she returned, Jason was gone. He has never been seen since. 

It should be noted that all three of these boys are classified as non-family abductions by law enforcement, and the Idaho Missing Persons Clearinghouse classifies them as ""involuntary missing."" Perhaps law enforcement knows more than they are listing publically, but these are where the cases are at today.

So we have three little boys that were abducted in the same state within a three-year range, two who lived reasonably close to each other. There is very little information available about these cases. I do not know if family members have been ruled out or not- though we know that Mack and Ricky have living family members who are actively searching for them. I also do not know if any other toddlers went missing in that time period, but were rescued or found deceased. 

Off the bad, I am inclined to believe that Ricky's case is unrelated. He lived several hundred miles from the other two boys, and there are several persons of interest in the case- namely his grandparents and possibly one of the workers who were delivering chickens that day. It is also possible that Ricky wandered off- though Idaho County is VAST and I doubt that Ricky would travel far on foot without being found. 

Whereas I do think Mack and Jason's disappearances could be related since they went missing under similar circumstances within the same region. I'm not married to this theory, but the likelihood is stronger than with the others. 

What do you think happened to these boys? Abduction? Death by adventure? Murder? Are they connected, or do you think they are unrelated?

A mysterious Neurological illness has been affecting people in Canada's New Brunswick province and has been leaving scientists and doctors baffled for over two years.

Patients are developing a number of symptoms ranging from rapid weight loss, insomnia, and hallucinations to difficulty thinking and limited mobility.

According to the article:

* One suspected case involved a man who was developing symptoms of dementia and ataxia. His wife, who was his caregiver, suddenly began losing sleep and experiencing muscle wasting, dementia and hallucinations. Now her condition is worse than his.
* A woman in her 30s was described as non-verbal, is feeding with a tube and drools excessively. Her caregiver, a nursing student in her 20s, also recently started showing symptoms of neurological decline.
* In another case, a young mother quickly lost nearly 60 pounds, developed insomnia and began hallucinating. Brain imaging showed advanced signs of atrophy.

Scientists believe this disease may have been caused by some environmental factor, and not purely localised to New Brunswick. However, the source of the disease is still unresolved.",UnresolvedMysteries,Mysterious New Brunswick Disease,0

Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. 

THE DISAPPEARENCE


On August 31, 2015, Macin sent a photo of his grades from school saying they were okay and that he could watch anime as seen in the transcript below:

“This good enough grades to watch Anime.”

His mom wrote back: 

“Wow! Looking good Macin. Have dad take you driving first.”


Macin Smith

Macin Smith was born on April 7, 1998. He was the youngest of six kids, and his family was originally from Canada. Macin moved with his parents Tracey and Darrin to St. George, Utah, shortly before he disappeared. 
Macin was described as very bright, but liked to spend time alone. He preferred playing video games or watching Anime, over hanging out with friends. Macin also had a history of depression, and his family thought that things were improving once they moved to Utah. 


Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. Macin was in summer school, because his credits from Canada didn’t transfer over. 
His family said Macin seemed happier in Utah. He had a speech impediment, and had gotten bullied when he was younger. Macin was also working with his dad on finally getting his driver’s license, but he didn’t think he was good enough to get it. Macin told his parents he wasn’t feeling well that night, and they left him alone. Tracey also said that she unplugged the internet, because Macin liked to watch Anime into the early morning hours. 
Around 1:30am, Darrin woke up and went to check on Macin. He found him watching Anime. He had plugged the internet back in, and Darrin ended up taking his computer and phone away. 
Darrin would later say that he and Macin didn’t get into a fight that night, and Macin just handed over his electronics, and seemed okay with it. 


￼

Macin’s parents, Tracey and Darrin

The Disappearance 
On Tuesday, September 1, Darrin woke Macin up around 7am for school. Tracey said she remembers Macin getting up right away, walking around and leaving around 7:40am. 
Macin still took the bus, and his bus stop was about 2 miles from his home. Tracey went to work that day, and Darrin stayed home to do yard work. Around 3:15pm, Macin’s bus had pulled up and started dropping kids off. By 3:30pm, Macin still didn’t return home. Darrin had no way of contacting him, because he had taken his phone the night before. 

Darrin texted Tracey that Macin never returned home. Tracey decided to check her email, and realized she received a message from the school that said Macin never showed up that day. Tracey was stunned and left work early. 
Tracey and Darrin also decided to go through Macin’s room, and they didn’t find anything. They also called Macin’s church youth group, and discovered he hadn’t been there. By 10pm, they called the St. George police, to report Macin missing. 
The Investigation
The police started their investigation right away, and Tracey started her own investigation. 
Tracey went to the high school to pay for Macin’s graduation cap and gown, and she realized Macin never showed up to school again. She also contacted the bus, and talked to several student that rode the bus. No one had seen Macin. 

Tracey and Darrin searched Macin’s room again, and they found his school binders on the floor of his closet. The episode described this as if Macin was hiding his school supplies, but nothing was ever found in his supplies. Macin’s wallet was also found in his room, with cash and ID cards in it. 
Tracey and Darrin called their other children and told them that their brother was missing. They all returned home to come and look for him. 
New Leads 
When Macin’s siblings returned, they all drove around putting up missing persons fliers of Macin. They also had the LDS church help with the search. 
Many tips came pouring in. One tip was about a male, matching Macin’s description, standing on the street with a sign that said need a ride to Vegas. This road was about 5 miles away from Macin’s home. 

The description of this person sounded like Macin. The road was surrounded by several gas stations, and the Smith’s contacted the stations about their surveillance footage. It turned out not to be Macin, it was another teenager. 
There was another tip that came in. This time, several people said they saw Macin in Las Vegas, which was about two hours from St. George. Darrin drove to Las Vegas to search, along with a search group called the Red Rock Search and Rescue. There was again no sign of Macin. 
The Note 
Tracey was the main talking head in this episode, and she said about a week passed with no sign or contact with Macin. Macin’s aunt was able to get the passwords for his computer, phone and social media. They discovered that Macin really didn’t use social media or his phone. He had deleted his search history, but mainly used his computer to watch Anime and play video games. 
They did find something else, though. In Macin’s wallet, they found a note. It was a two page note, that had been folded multiple times. It wasn’t addressed to anyone or dated, but it was a very “deep” note. The Smith’s have not released much information about it. All they said was that Macin had written “I’m done.” 

The police believed that Macin didn’t want anyone to find that note, and if he did want it found, he would’ve put it in an obvious place. 
Tracey said that Macin had told her he tried to commit suicide before, but she didn’t believe he wanted to hurt himself again. They didn’t own any gun, or have any pills. She said anything was possible, but she just didn’t believe it. 
Another Search
Three weeks later, the Red Rock Search and Rescue came to help the Smith’s. They came out to St. George for two days. They brought equestrians and six cadaver dogs from California. It was the largest wilderness search to date, and there were still no signs of Macin Smith. 
A Macin Smith Facebook page was created, and this led to many rumors about Macin, his family and what happened to him. 
There were rumors that Macin was gay, and disappeared because he didn’t want to tell his family. Tracey said she didn’t believe that he was gay, and even if he was it didn’t matter to them. 

Five months after Macin disappeared, allegations against Darrin Smith came out. They said that Darrin had killed his son. Darrin denied it, and said the police could do anything to prove that he didn’t. He and Tracey both took polygraph tests, and Tracey said they both passed. However, the St. George police declined to comment. To me this sounds like one of them didn’t pass, but maybe they just can’t comment since it’s an open investigation. 
Tracey also believed that Macin would return or get into contact with someone once he turned 18. They hosted an event on his 18th birthday, and Macin didn’t return or reach out to anyone. 
Another Dead End 
In July 2016, a tip came in from two girls said they saw Macin at a Panda Express in West Valley. They said this boy approached them, and asked them for some change for the bus. They noticed he was very polite, and that he had a speech impediment. 
When Tracey heard about this, she had the girls call Macin’s phone to hear his voicemail. The girls said that this was the voice of the person they talked to. 
The police contacted the Panda Express for their surveillance footage, but of course, it wasn’t working. 

Where is Macin?
Tracey believes Macin is out there somewhere. She even kept paying his phone bill for awhile because it was the only number he knew. She stopped paying for it eventually. 
Darrin thinks his son is gone. 
There is a $10,000 reward out there for any information about where Macin could be. 
The theories about what happened include: suicide and foul play. 

Maybe one day, there will be answers about Macin Smith. If you have any information, you can contact the St. George police at 435-627-4300. 

As late as 2017, the police have said that there have been changes in Tracey and Darrin’s stories. They have told the police, the Red Rock group and the media different things. 
In 2018, Tracey and Darrin Smith divorced, and they are both remarried.

However, the St. George police declined to comment. To me this sounds like one of them didn’t pass, but maybe they just can’t comment since it’s an open investigation. 
Tracey also believed that Macin would return or get into contact with someone once he turned 18. They hosted an event on his 18th birthday, and Macin didn’t return or reach out to anyone. 
Another Dead End 
In July 2016, a tip came in from two girls said they saw Macin at a Panda Express in West Valley. They said this boy approached them, and asked them for some change for the bus. They noticed he was very polite, and that he had a speech impediment. 
When Tracey heard about this, she had the girls call Macin’s phone to hear his voicemail. The girls said that this was the voice of the person they talked to. 
The police contacted the Panda Express for their surveillance footage, but of course, it wasn’t working. 

Where is Macin?
Tracey believes Macin is out there somewhere. She even kept paying his phone bill for awhile because it was the only number he knew. She stopped paying for it eventually. 
Darrin thinks his son is gone. 
There is a $10,000 reward out there for any information about where Macin could be. 
The theories about what happened include: suicide and foul play. 

Maybe one day, there will be answers about Macin Smith. If you have any information, you can contact the St. George police at 435-627-4300. 

As late as 2017, the police have said that there have been changes in Tracey and Darrin’s stories. They have told the police, the Red Rock group and the media different things. 
In 2018, Tracey and Darrin Smith divorced, and they are both remarried.

he tried to commit suicide at least once, in addition to trying to run away from home, having once run away while still living in Canada, having given up and coming home due to the cold weather that was the night of the escape.

Wors from his uncle: 

""Macin suffered from depression, he had tried to commit suicide when he was 15, and was hospitalized, during this time. Macin felt he was different, and felt he did not fit in. I have read the note he left, and it is heartbreaking. I have always felt Macin committed suicide, but I have always wanted answers, and if that is what happened, a proper resting place for him, and the peace of knowing.""

Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. 

THE DISAPPEARENCE


On August 31, 2015, Macin sent a photo of his grades from school saying they were okay and that he could watch anime as seen in the transcript below:

“This good enough grades to watch Anime.”

His mom wrote back: 

“Wow! Looking good Macin. Have dad take you driving first.”


Macin Smith

Macin Smith was born on April 7, 1998. He was the youngest of six kids, and his family was originally from Canada. Macin moved with his parents Tracey and Darrin to St. George, Utah, shortly before he disappeared. 
Macin was described as very bright, but liked to spend time alone. He preferred playing video games or watching Anime, over hanging out with friends. Macin also had a history of depression, and his family thought that things were improving once they moved to Utah. 
The Day Before 
On Monday, August 31, 2015, Macin texted his mom a picture of his report card. The attached message read:

“This good enough grades to watch Anime.”

His mom wrote back: 

“Wow! Looking good Macin. Have dad take you driving first.”

Macin had an agreement with his parents, that if he received good grades and did his homework, then he could watch Anime during the week. Macin was in summer school, because his credits from Canada didn’t transfer over. 
His family said Macin seemed happier in Utah. He had a speech impediment, and had gotten bullied when he was younger. Macin was also working with his dad on finally getting his driver’s license, but he didn’t think he was good enough to get it. Macin told his parents he wasn’t feeling well that night, and they left him alone. Tracey also said that she unplugged the internet, because Macin liked to watch Anime into the early morning hours. 
Around 1:30am, Darrin woke up and went to check on Macin. He found him watching Anime. He had plugged the internet back in, and Darrin ended up taking his computer and phone away. 
Darrin would later say that he and Macin didn’t get into a fight that night, and Macin just handed over his electronics, and seemed okay with it.

Macin’s parents, Tracey and Darrin

The Disappearance 
On Tuesday, September 1, Darrin woke Macin up around 7am for school. Tracey said she remembers Macin getting up right away, walking around and leaving around 7:40am. 
Macin still took the bus, and his bus stop was about 2 miles from his home. Tracey went to work that day, and Darrin stayed home to do yard work. Around 3:15pm, Macin’s bus had pulled up and started dropping kids off. By 3:30pm, Macin still didn’t return home. Darrin had no way of contacting him, because he had taken his phone the night before. 

Darrin texted Tracey that Macin never returned home. Tracey decided to check her email, and realized she received a message from the school that said Macin never showed up that day. Tracey was stunned and left work early. 
Tracey and Darrin also decided to go through Macin’s room, and they didn’t find anything. They also called Macin’s church youth group, and discovered he hadn’t been there. By 10pm, they called the St. George police, to report Macin missing. 
The Investigation
The police started their investigation right away, and Tracey started her own investigation. 
Tracey went to the high school to pay for Macin’s graduation cap and gown, and she realized Macin never showed up to school again. She also contacted the bus, and talked to several student that rode the bus. No one had seen Macin. 

Tracey and Darrin searched Macin’s room again, and they found his school binders on the floor of his closet. The episode described this as if Macin was hiding his school supplies, but nothing was ever found in his supplies. Macin’s wallet was also found in his room, with cash and ID cards in it. 
Tracey and Darrin called their other children and told them that their brother was missing. They all returned home to come and look for him. 
New Leads 
When Macin’s siblings returned, they all drove around putting up missing persons fliers of Macin. They also had the LDS church help with the search. 
Many tips came pouring in. One tip was about a male, matching Macin’s description, standing on the street with a sign that said need a ride to Vegas. This road was about 5 miles away from Macin’s home. 

The description of this person sounded like Macin. The road was surrounded by several gas stations, and the Smith’s contacted the stations about their surveillance footage. It turned out not to be Macin, it was another teenager. 
There was another tip that came in. This time, several people said they saw Macin in Las Vegas, which was about two hours from St. George. Darrin drove to Las Vegas to search, along with a search group called the Red Rock Search and Rescue. There was again no sign of Macin. 
The Note 
Tracey was the main talking head in this episode, and she said about a week passed with no sign or contact with Macin. Macin’s aunt was able to get the passwords for his computer, phone and social media. They discovered that Macin really didn’t use social media or his phone. He had deleted his search history, but mainly used his computer to watch Anime and play video games. 
They did find something else, though. In Macin’s wallet, they found a note. It was a two page note, that had been folded multiple times. It wasn’t addressed to anyone or dated, but it was a very “deep” note. The Smith’s have not released much information about it. All they said was that Macin had written “I’m done.” 

The police believed that Macin didn’t want anyone to find that note, and if he did want it found, he would’ve put it in an obvious place. 
Tracey said that Macin had told her he tried to commit suicide before, but she didn’t believe he wanted to hurt himself again. They didn’t own any gun, or have any pills. She said anything was possible, but she just didn’t believe it. 
Another Search
Three weeks later, the Red Rock Search and Rescue came to help the Smith’s. They came out to St. George for two days. They brought equestrians and six cadaver dogs from California. It was the largest wilderness search to date, and there were still no signs of Macin Smith. 
A Macin Smith Facebook page was created, and this led to many rumors about Macin, his family and what happened to him. 
There were rumors that Macin was gay, and disappeared because he didn’t want to tell his family. Tracey said she didn’t believe that he was gay, and even if he was it didn’t matter to them. 

Five months after Macin disappeared, allegations against Darrin Smith came out. They said that Darrin had killed his son. Darrin denied it, and said the police could do anything to prove that he didn’t. He and Tracey both took polygraph tests, and Tracey said they both passed. However, the St. George police declined to comment. To me this sounds like one of them didn’t pass, but maybe they just can’t comment since it’s an open investigation. 
Tracey also believed that Macin would return or get into contact with someone once he turned 18. They hosted an event on his 18th birthday, and Macin didn’t return or reach out to anyone. 
Another Dead End 
In July 2016, a tip came in from two girls said they saw Macin at a Panda Express in West Valley. They said this boy approached them, and asked them for some change for the bus. They noticed he was very polite, and that he had a speech impediment.

Carol Reed: went missing on Dec 7 1993 from Brownsville, TX. found on Dec 9 1993, murder by strangulation. Was wearing a mickey mouse watch.

Melissa Witt: went missing on Dec 1 1994 from Fort Smith AR, murdered by strangulation - body found on Jan 13 1994. Was wearing a mickey mouse watch.

Melissa Trotter: went missing on Dec. 8 1998 from Conroe, TX. murder by strangulation - body found Jan 2 1999. Was wearing a mickey mouse watch.

Although Larry Swearingen was already executed for the murder of Melissa Trotter, I believe Melissa Trotter and Melissa Witt's cases are linked, and potentially Reed's too.

I have discovered some potentially linked content online, created by a man who has ties to Texas and Arkansas. He has a 30-year background in forestry (ie, he's familiar with national forest land) but more importantly, he's passionate about making simulated snuff porn videos, in which, he has his models wear - you guessed it - MICKEY MOUSE WATCHES while they play dead.

He has produced multiple films where he has the model who is posing dead wear a mickey mouse watch. He has an extensive body of work. He claims to have filmed over a thousand fetish videos about strangulation, and I believe him! I can easily find about 450 when I search online. He stars as the male murderer/strangler in most of his films.

The majority of his fetish films follow a similar plot line. He abducts a woman, strangles her with pantyhose , and has sex with her dead body, sometimes leaving her in the woods when he is done with her.

His death fetish writing has a focus on strangling southern women who are college students.

Here are some excerpts from his writing that remind me of Trotter and Witt:

“ I am 100% killer. I love in so many different ways to take a beautiful woman or lovely young woman of age and push her to her limits during her struggle. I love to see the tongue fishing for air when I am strangling. My next favorite part is to take my time exploring the corpse. Smelling, touching, tasting and then some nice long sex with the still warm body. After I finish, I love to drag, carry or dispose of the body in an outdoor location in the woods or in a field with tall grass. Body disposal in tarp, plastic or burial, or stash in the woods behind a log so that the law is close behind. I love the element of danger and possible capture as the villain. They will never get me, if they do I will escape. “

“A young woman is found (dead) in the woods with one shoe and white socks”

(This aligns with Trotter's crime scene photo where she is wearing white socks and missing one shoe.)

“Her once pink tongue bulged over her bottom teeth, hiding the perfect row of white… showing the bluish cast of her lips, the red and purple streaks that surrounded her throat completed her transformation from the living to the dead….he made love to her cooling body…. He looked for a studio to rent at Westwood campus…he couldn’t wait. He knew how beautiful southern women were.”

359,JoeDW1969,1641099966,"Many of the facts of this case were updated on June 14, 2020 by WNYT on their cold case program which was posted on YouTube. Many previous know facts were incorrect based on first hand accounts by her sister Jennifer and investigator Matt Wilson with the Saratoga Springs police department.

**Updated version of disappearance:**

Tammie McCormick was a 13 year old girl who lived in the Geyser Crest area of Saratoga Springs and attended seventh grade at Saratoga Springs Junior High School, which was then on West Circular Street. On Monday, April 28, 1986, Tammie had one of her friends sneak in her house and hide in her closet to stay over night without her family’s knowledge. Their plan was to runaway to Jacksonville Florida together in the morning by hitchhiking after her family left for work and school. On the morning of Tuesday, April 29, Tammie and her sister Jennifer were the only ones in her family still home, and Tammie told her sister that she intended to skip school that day. Her sister asked her if she wanted her to skip with her, and she told her “no, just go ahead and go” and so Jennifer went to school. After Jennifer left, her friend who stayed over night hiding in the closet stated to investigators that Tammie left the house, leaving her there alone, and didn’t tell her why she left or where she was going. Her friend met up with another friend, and followed through on their plan to hitchhike to Jacksonville Florida.

On the morning of Tuesday, April 29, a motorist claims to have seen a girl hitchhiking that matched Tammie’s description, but she was not heading south (to Florida). He claims he picked her up and dropped her off at Route 9P near Saratoga Lake. This is the last time anyone sees her.

Tammie’s mother Nancy Hieber allowed Tammie and unusual amount of freedom for a 13 year old girl, and it wasn’t unusual for Tammie to not come home and stay the night at a friends house without notifying her family. For this reason, when Tammie didn’t come home on Tuesday April 29 and Wednesday April 30th, her mother assumed she was staying at a friends house and was not alarmed. On Thursday, May 1, after not hearing from her daughter for two days and learning she hadn't attended school in those days, Nancy filed a missing persons report with the Saratoga Springs Police Department.

**Suspect:**

In February 2011, NewsChannel 13 broke the news that police had reopened the cold case and were now treating the investigation as a homicide. They also had a person of interest in the case Arthur ""Mason"" Slaybaugh II. Mason was a 26 year old whom police learned Tammie and her friends use to hang out with. Mason had a small house on Brown’s Beach near Saratoga Lake where he was known to have underage girls over partying and drinking. His small house is near the location where Tammie was dropped off and last seen by the motorist who picked her up hitchhiking. Based on the accounts, investigators believe that Tammie was heading for Mason’s apartment house that morning. Saratoga Springs Police Assistant Chief John Catone said in 2011 that he had evidence McCormick went to Slaybaugh's apartment around the time of her disappearance. Mason had an adult girlfriend who coincidently moved to Jacksonville Florida the same day Tammie disappeared. CBS6 reported in 2011 that Tammie use to babysit for Mason’s girlfriend’s child. Mason, a former corrections officer at Mount McGregor Correctional facility in Wilton died of a heart attack in January 2001 at the age of 41.

**Search for Tammie’s remains**:

Mason Slaybaugh had a brother Kenneth Slaybaugh who owns land that sits along Route 30 in the town of North Hampton, Fulton County, about 30 miles from where Tammie disappeared. In early November, 2017, police had new leads surface that were vetted and presented to a city judge who signed off on a search warrant to search Kenneth Slaybaugh’s property. Neighbors say Mason and Kenneth use to bury all kinds of things in their backyard including car parts and boats at all hours of the night. Saratoga Springs Police, the FBI, and state forensics investigators brought in an excavator to dig up the property as well as ground penetrating radar. Saratoga Springs police spokesman Lt Robert Jillson said investigators were focused on a former garbage pit behind the structure. Jillson acknowledged they were looking for remains. “If there wasn’t the possibility, we wouldn’t be digging there”. ""We have reason to believe her remains are there,” Jillson stated. After two days of excavating the land, police ended the search of the property after not finding any evidence related to Tammie’s disappearance.

**Vital Statistics**

* **Date Of Birth**: July 3, 1972
* **Age at Time of Disappearance**: 13 years old
* **Height and Weight at Time of Disappearance**: 5'5; 108 pounds
* **Distinguishing Characteristics**: White female. Shoulder length, light brown/blonde hair; hazel eyes.

* **Clothing**: An over sized, yellow and white striped shirt; black corduroy pants; and beige, high heeled boots. Jean Jacket. She was carrying a shoulder bag.
* **Dentals**: Available.
* **DNA**: Available.

**Updated inaccuracies from previous reports:**

**\* Tammie went missing on April 19:** April 19th was a Saturday. Tammie went missing on Tuesday,  
April 29th after skipping school.

* **Tammie missed the bus and was going to hitchhike to school:** Tammie’s sister Jennifer stated that Tammie intended to skip school that day and had no intentions of going.
* **Tammie was last seen by her sister Jennifer at home:** Police reports indicate a girl matching Tammie’s description was last seen hitchhiking by a motorist, who picked her up and dropped her off near Saratoga Lake.

**After thoughts:**

It has been over 35 years since Tammie’s disappearance, and sadly, her disappearance is still a mystery. Police and family believe she is no longer alive, and police suspect Aurther Mason Slaybaugh II, a deceased man is her killer. It’s worth noting that a year prior in 1985, SUNY Albany student Karen Wilson mysteriously went missing near the SUNY campus in Albany without a trace, and has never been found. Where Karen went missing is about 45 minutes south of Sarataga Springs. In 1998 another SUNY student from Boston Spa, Suzanne Lyall also went missing near the SUNY campus and was never found. Her disappearance was 12 years after Tammie’s, but Karen’s was only 13 months prior. What are your thoughts? Do you think Slaybaugh is the guy as police do, or do you think it could be the work of a serial killer that was in the area who happened to come across Tammie hitchhiking? Could Tammie still be alive and out there somewhere?

Disclaimer: Now I want to start off by saying that this potential development is not a news story that you can search up related to the case. This is something I discovered myself while doing research into Michael Dunahee's case.

**What I Found:**

Ever since I first heard about Michael Dunahee's disappearance/abduction, I have been fascinated by the case and it has stuck with me ever since. There was something about it that always made me come back and revisit it every now and then. Something so bold and brazen about somebody abducting somebodies child in a busy parking lot on a day when many families had gathered at the Blanshard Elementary School for a game of touch football.

For those not familiar with the case , here is a link to the wiki article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance\_of\_Michael\_Dunahee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Michael_Dunahee)

Now here is what I found. While searching up videos on Youtube about the case, looking for any new and interesting info about the case, I came across a strange youtube channel. The channel is called ""rcmp is corrupt alberni"" and it is run by a man named Rick. The name in question; Rick, claims to be from Port Alberni. There is a small town called Port Alberni on Vancouver Island, the same island where Victoria is, Michael's home city where he disappeared.

Now this man makes a lot of wild claims like how the RCMP is gang stalking him and has been for years. But the most striking claim of all is that he claims to have the remains of two missing children in his possession. He never mentions the other child by name, but he specifically mentions Michael Dunahee by name and claims his remains is one of them. He claims to have had them for 30 years which is how long Dunahee has been missing. He says he is holding out on giving up the remains until he receives millions of dollars from the Canadian government.

Now i'm not quite sure what to make of this. I have thought about sending this info to the Victoria police, but I want your guys' opinion before I do. Maybe he was already investigated by the Victoria PD and cleared as a suspect or maybe he is actively being investigated right now.

Here is a link to his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ)

Here is a link to his most viewed video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfu-0XKUOV0&amp;list=UUYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ&amp;index=39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfu-0XKUOV0&amp;list=UUYOPRi2t4UgnqYHF9dVsSxQ&amp;index=39)

So what do you guys think? Is this all BS? Is the man simply just mentally ill? Or is he the one responsible for abducting Michael back in 1991? I'M NOT SAYING HE IS GUILTY OF TAKING MICHAEL, I HAVE NO PROOF. However I just find it odd that is channel popped up out of nowhere around three years ago and he is claiming to have the remains of missing children, including the remains of one of the most well known missing children, who is missing not far from where he lives.

Martin Crumblish attended a party at a popular clearing known as The View. The View was a local hang out spot, near the country club in Dobbs Ferry NY.

When questioned, other teens at the party stated that around 11:00 p.m. Martin had walked a female friend home before returning to the party.

Martin then left the party again around midnight and headed for his friend's house on Myrtle Avenue. This was the last time Martin Crumblish was seen alive. His wallet along with other personal items, were found near his last known location.

 Martin was supposed to be spending the night with a friend, they both had to take there SAT exams the next day. This friend didn’t recall seeing Martin after the party.

Martin was very popular amongst his peers. And although he was on the school football and baseball teams, he didn’t fit the typical stereotype. He was described as being very sensitive, an artistic person who enjoyed writing poetry. 

Martin's loved ones do not believe he would have ran away, they stated, he was very excited about a new job and wouldn’t have just left it, even if he had, he would have contacted his family eventually to tell them he was ok. That’s just the kind of kid he was. There has been no activity on his Social Security number since his disappearance.

In 2002, over twenty years after Martin's disappearance, his case was reclassified from a missing person to a probable homicide. Apparently He was having issues with some local kids at the time of his disappearance. Authorities believe he may have gotten into a fight and was, perhaps accidentally killed shortly after he was last seen. They have conducted several searches for his remans in the area but concisistantly turn up nothing.

Both of Martin's parents are still alive; his father lives in California and his mother in upstate New York. They continue to hope for break in his case, any ounce of closure at all would suffice.

Born January 7th 1964, making him 57 in the making of this video. Martin was a 17 year old Caucasian Male with blonde hair and blue eyes. He was 6ft tall and weighed around 165lb. He had a small substance abuse problem at the time. Do you or anyone you know have any information regarding to his disappearance? If you have any information please contact the Dobbs Ferry Police Department at 914-693-5500.

367,awpmag,1641070259,"Lousy police work, lawyers not following up on key witnesses and most alarming, a Sheriff Sgt that never sought critical information about how exactly the victim was killed. Did Arizona send an innocent man to die?

When a jury handed Barry Lee Jones a death sentence in 1995 for an unspeakable crime - the rape and murder of his girlfriend's four-year-old daughter - he remained adamant that he did not commit the act.

Almost 3,000 prisoners have been exonerated in the US since 1989 – including 186 innocent people who were condemned to death. 

It's estimated that between them they spent more than 25,000 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit.

Jones, who had children of his own, had been accused of killing Rachel Yvonne Gray in May 1994 at the Desert Vista Trailer Park in Tucson, where they all lived in a cramped trailer.

The death was caused by “a small bowel laceration due to blunt abdominal trauma,” according to court documents, which said she also suffered from a laceration to her left scalp, injuries to her vagina and “multiple internal and external” bruises.

## What happened?

Angela Gray, the little girl's mother, said she’d spent most of May 1 1994 sleeping but when she woke up, Jones told her Rachel had fallen out of his parked work van causing her to bleed on her head. 

He said he had taken her to the nearby Rural Metro Fire Station for medical attention.

After putting her to sleep, Gray found Rachel unresponsive the next morning, with her eyes rolled back in her head.

The couple took the girl to a Tucson hospital, where she was pronounced dead because of a bowel laceration from being hit in the abdomen, reported The Intercept.

But before the medical examiner had determined a cause of death, Jones became Pima County Sheriff Sgt Pesquiera’s sole suspect. 

This was because Jones had later admitted that he had actually lied about taking her to the fire station and getting checked up.

[Instead what happened was that he’d seen a police officer at the station and he didn't want to be caught driving with a suspended license. So he drove on to a Quik Mart store, where he spotted a paramedic.](https://www.awallprintss.com/post/barry-jones-death-row-prisons-usa)

Episioco was no stranger to violence - he had witnessed his 13-year-old friend Alex Arroyo get gunned down as the two young teenagers sat in the back of a car in October of 1996. Episioco had testified in recent months against the killer of his friend, gang member Jerry Lara.  Episioco's testimony helped convict Lara of the murder of Alex Arroyo.

As he made his way to school, an unidentified teenager approached Episioco from behind and asked for a cigarette.  Without awaiting a response, the assailant produced a gun and fired a single round into the back of Episioco's head before fleeing the scene. Episioco would not survive his injuries.

Police did not publicly link the murder to Episioco's testimony against Lara in the aftermath of the slaying, but no one has ever been identified as the suspected gunman in the now almost 25-year-old murder.

Are there any new updates or information? It seems unsettling that very little is being released even if they're unsure if she's been abducted or just got lost.

For those unfamiliar with this case, Lina Sardar Khil was first reported missing on the evening of Dec. 20 after she was last seen at the Villa Del Cabo apartment complex in the 9400 block of  Fredericksburg.

Despite pouring massive resources into the search, along with a cash reward for information on her disappearance, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said a lack of tips hasn't brought them any closer to figuring out what happened to the child.

“There’s nothing that we haven’t done to try to find her,” McManus said. “It’s  frustrating and disheartening, disappointing that we haven’t come up  with something yet.”

Police have now shut down both command posts dedicated to the search, but  McManus said “there is no lessening of the intensity of the  investigation.”

This case just feels so underreported.

379,Red-neckedPhalarope,1640978862,"This is an odd one, and honestly based on what's available so far I don't hold out a lot of hope for a speedy resolution.

On September 26, 2021, a hiker on a Rails to Trails path in the town of Portland, Chautauqua County, NY, found part of a human skull. Investigators at the scene not only found more of that skeleton, but located another body soon after, only feet away. This was already highly unusual for a town of fewer than 5,000 people, but the circumstances around these two bodies were odder still.

The second body to be found was the first to be identified. 50-year-old Marquita Mull was last seen alive on June 25 and reported missing by her family on July 18 after they realized that she had not been checking in with her father as she usually did and hadn't picked up her most recent disability check. 

Mull really had an unfair hand in life. She struggled with her mental health, and in 2012 she was struck by a hit-and-run driver and left with permanent physical disabilities (including a TBI) as well. As a result of her disabilities she didn't drive and she didn't own a cell phone; she traveled around her hometown of Buffalo, NY, by foot or on the bus. Buffalo is more than 50 miles from Portland, and no public transit connects the two. Police and her family consider it virtually impossible that she could have gone to Portland on her own, and she had no known connection to the Portland area. 

The first-discovered, as-yet unidentified set of remains was much less recent -- likely decades old. Like Mull, they appeared to be female, but little else is known (or at least little else has been made public.) Dental records ruled out a connection to two of Chautauqua County's three open missing person cases: Lori Bova, who disappeared in 1997, and Corrie Anderson, missing since 2008. The third and oldest missing woman, Patricia Laemmerhirt (1976), has not yet been ruled out according to the most recent information I can find. DNA has been sent for testing and comparison to national missing persons cases, but if a match has been made, it's not public yet.

Both of the deaths are being considered foul play by law enforcement at this time, based on the fact that the bodies appear to have been dumped (and the Jane Doe was buried.)

Obviously this raises a lot of questions:

1. Who killed Marquita Mull, and why? Her family has been very active in getting her case out there and searching for answers, and doesn't seem to be under any suspicion (and if they were involved, dumping the body in Chautauqua County as opposed to someplace nearer to Buffalo makes very little sense.) She was vulnerable because of her disabilities and might have been targeted by someone who had seen her around the neighborhood, or a total stranger. If it was a neighbor, again, why go all the way to Chautauqua County to dump her, and how did they know the spot to do it? If it was someone from Portland or the surrounding area, why drive over an hour into Buffalo to find a victim?

2. Who is the Jane Doe? At this point it seems like our only hope is DNA, which may take some time. The remains must be fairly deteriorated if they can't even narrow them down to a decade, and if any personal effects were found that information hasn't been made public.

3. Did the same person kill two women decades apart and dump them within feet of each other? If so, what were they doing for all those years in between? Locked up? Killing elsewhere? On a break? There is another unsolved murder of a Jane Doe victim in Chautauqua County dating from 1983, but it seems very different M.O.-wise - that victim was left by the side of the road and found only hours after her death. If it wasn't the same person, why did two people choose this relatively out-of-the-way spot in a small town to dispose of bodies from, in at least one case, an entirely different part of WNY? It's not exactly the East River over there.

381,jokubas349,1640975185,"**December 29 marked exactly one year after Arnoldas Rakauskas mysteriously disappeared in Kaunas district, Lithuania. The young guy’s mother still lives in heartbreaking uncertainty. Although the search for her son is still fruitless, the woman does not lose hope that there are people who have seen or know something.**

“I live in waiting. The *\[last\]* search for my son took place in the spring *\[of 2021\].* From time to time, an investigator calls me and we talk. That’s pretty much how it is...” - said Jurgita, Arnoldas’ mother.

On December 29th, 2020, a 22-year-old Arnoldas visited a friend in Kazimierava village, in Kaunas district. Here, he had to stay overnight, but the next day he promised to return to his parent’s home in Jonava, where he lived. Arnoldas disappeared on the night from 29th to 30th of December. Police officials, cadaver dogs, divers and volunteers combed the surroundings of Kaunas district, moving toward Jonava immediately after the disappearance and then later, in the Spring, to no avail.  

Next day *\[31st of December\]*, the friends of Arnoldas started their own independent search, combing the surroundings of the Kazimierava village. “We organized everything ourselves. We gathered a group of people and were looking for Arnoldas within the radius of about 10-15 km *\[≈ 6.2 to 9.3 miles\]* from the village. We covered the radius, searched the forest more than once. I want to find him at any cost” - said Inesa, Arnoldas’ friend. According to Inesa, over 60 people gathered to look for the young man on Thursday morning. She mentioned currently combing the Ibenai area, emphasizing that the search should continue in the town of Vandziogala, Domeikava, and other areas. Inesa said the helicopter was used to search for Arnoldas’ whereabouts on Wednesday *\[30th of December\],* but the search was fruitless.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dreadful suspicions**

“Now that one year has passed, I feel like my son was probably killed, because if he was alive, he would have definitely given a sign. His disappearance is shrouded in mystery...” - barely holding back tears, said Arnoldas’ mom.

She added, looking for a way to access the records of unidentified human remains. “If I got the lists, I could review the period when my son disappeared. Because, for example, the remains of a person were found in Lampedziai *\[≈ 20km/12.4 miles from where Arnoldas dissapeared\]* and A. Juozapavicius Avenue *\[≈ 25km/15.5 miles\]*. Yet, no such access was granted, even though the police have my DNA. Maybe Arnoldas traveled to the opposite end of Lithuania and fell into a body of water” - considered Arnoldas’ mother.

Jurgita does not lose hope and trust that someone who knows about Arnoldas eventually will come forward and let her know. The young guy’s mother asks people to look at her son’s picture again. “Maybe someone offered him a lift or saw something, maybe someone will remember anything” - she said while crying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Told what happened**

As Jurgita told the journalists in the spring, Arnoldas was supposed to spend the evening and night with his friend’s family. Only these individuals *\[Arnoldas, his friend and friend’s wife with their son\]* were inside during the evening of disappearance. “I was told that my son and his friend went outside to smoke next to the gazebo. After they finished smoking, Arnoldas’ friend invited him back inside, because it was freezing and they were only wearing short-sleeved T-shirts. Arnoldas turned around and walked into the night”.

Arnoldas’ mom speculated that maybe the two of them argued and got into a fight, but was later told by Arnoldas’ friend that was not the case. A. Rakauskas, wearing a black T-shirt with white inscriptions, black jeans and dark-colored, almost black shoes, allegedly walked into the dark in an unknown direction. He had nothing left with him, his wallet with personal documents, keys and a mobile phone all stayed inside his jacket inside the friend’s place.

In the interview with Arnoldas' friend Inesa, she mentioned that the their friend's house is surrounded by forests and meadows. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Considered different scenarios**

According to A. Rakauskas’ mother, the said friend started looking for her son immediately after getting putting his shoes and jacket. After 20-30 minutes, a neighbour from the house next door joined the unsuccessful search for the young guy. “At 1am of the same night, police notified me that my son is missing. One hour later, police arrived at my door. I couldn’t understand what was happening at first, and I said that Arnoldas will come back, because he called me in the evening. He was a responsible child, we had a strong connection”.

Jurgita added that when she first heard the news, she thought Arnoldas was walking home, the distance of about 26 kilometers *\[≈ 16.1 miles\].* Arnoldas was always physically strong. He would probably have covered that distance. Speaking about this scenario, Arnoldas’ mother said she did not rule out the possibility that perhaps her soon, who decided to walk home that night, sat down and because he was a little drunk and froze to death, because it was chilly. “I do not blame his friend for the disappearance. When new information comes forward, we will know better. We considered different versions, including suicide. Could that have been the case? I don’t believe he could have done that, but there’s always a possibility.

Arnoldas Rakauskas disappeared on the evening of December 29th, at about 10:30 pm. The officials were notified of Arnoldas’ disappearance on the night of December 29th to December 30th, at about 12:38 am. When he left, Arnoldas was wearing black jeans and a dark shirt. Height - 185 cm *\[ ≈ 6.1 ft.\].* Hair colour - brown. He has a scar on his forehead.

My sister who isn't Reddit savvy asked me about an unsolved case that took place in rural Ohio in 1998 involving the unexplained death of her husband's (my brother in law) friend.

He was last seen at a grocery store around 7 PM and then found 11 days later in a corn field with ligature marks around his neck and the cause of death as asphyxiation. ""Tracks"" were found across his chest, but I'm not really sure what that entails.

It's been an unexplained death for so long that even in this local area it's not really mentioned very much anymore - really just among the town itself occasionally.

I don't believe the death was ever looked into and they still have no idea what happened. Below is the link to really all we can find.

Their successes are made up of twelve cases that were solved with the decedent’s identity being made public, and one case that was solved but the identity not disclosed (Baseline John Doe 1983).

Whilst this isn't your standard conventional case post I have posted (and apologies if this isn't allowed!), I have found whilst scouring the UK Missing Persons website (the site with listings and some images of the unidentified deceased within the country), a statistical snapshot of missing persons statistics regarding each police force within the United Kingdom.

As someone who is a bit of a stats geek (and only got a Grade C/4 pass grade at GCSE Maths at the age of 33), I find this information absolutely interesting. The link I have shared above provides a link to a number of reports that are produced with information that each police force supplies with reasons why people go missing, outcomes and some updates even on UDIs. Whilst 20/21 hasn't been uploaded yet and probably won't for a while due to issues with Covid-19; this post will dissect the findings in the most recent report.

Greater Manchester and the Metropolitan (covering London) forces produced the most missing persons reports with 35k and 56k respectively. Take in mind these are rather large geographical areas within the country and attract a number of tourists to their area. The force with the lowest was Wiltshire (excluding the small City of London area) was 2.1k. Some forces posted a decline over previous years with the West Midlands force area posting the biggest, which is fascinating for a large metropolitan area at -37.4%, whilst the biggest increase was Durham force area in North East England posting the biggest increase with 157.% but factor in this is a small area.

Sadly, the majority of missing person reports in the Metropolitan force area were reports to do with children, which took up a bulk of their reports over adults. Greater Manchester and West Midlands were not far behind with a high amount of missing children reports. Thankfully for those three forces, those numbers were down over 2018/9.

Males are more likely to be reported missing than females, and there were 319 transpeople who went missing during the 2019/20 period. 7.4% had no gender reported at all. The age groups which had the most missing people reports were 12-17 and 18-39 years. This is probably a reason why in some areas, there's a high amount of missing children as someone under 18 is classed as a child in the UK. 

The majority at 63% are medium-risk cases when reports were submitted and assessed. This could be people who are elderly and more vulnerable due to ill health, dementia or those with mental health issues or in a bad situation at home e.g potentially fleeing domestic abuse. 14% of reports provide no further risk at all. More females than males under 18 are reported as a Child Sexual Exploitation risk, whilst it's more common in males to be a mental health risk and that's within adults and children. 

On a positive note, most missing persons who are found are not harmed. Unfortunately this information is vague as not all police forces in the country provide informations. Most harm is either self-harm due to mental health issues or physical harm say in a confrontation or a fracture. 955 cases have sadly been fatal, with 26 of those being children. May those souls rest in peace and have a family and loved ones keeping their names alive. This was an increase of 6% unfortunately from 2018/9.

The vast majority of reasons why people go missing are a breakdown within a relationship albeit within a family or a partner, mental health issues and drugs or alcohol. Within those under 18 it's  juveniles who are unaccompanied without an adult or relationship breakdowns. Those over 65 years old are likely to go missing due to dementia which sadly is common due to the lack of capacity and having worked within care homes, an escapee was often a common occurrence. Thankfully many were home within a few minutes or hours. Sadly there have been a few cases in the public eye where someone with dementia has passed away whilst missing. 

There are 4543 long-term missing individuals within the UK. Scotland has 773 cases, whilst in England Devon and Cornwall tops the list with 707. According to a disclaimer at the bottom of this information, 42% of Scotland's 773 long-term missing have been presumed dead have died either due to a sea accident or no body can be recovered in the water. It'll be worth knowing, where there any unaccounted for with the Piper Alpha incident in the late 1980s? 

44 unidentified cases were reported in the 2019/20 with sadly 17 of these still unresolved. Most of those have been bodies or human remains (e.g feet, or a skull). The Metropolitan Police area was the one with the most unresolved cases with 5 (inc 1 for City of London). Again, I hope now with advances in DNA and technology we can get these resolved very soon so some families and friends of there get closure and their names are rightfully back to them. 

There are 974 unidentified cases across the whole of the UK. The majority of those are bodies. Interesting to note with statistics within the police force, Avon and Somerset have managed to have one case resolved in the last few years (be interesting to know which case it was), but unfortunately the picture overall is very few get resolved. 

There are a few points to take from these statistics:

There needs to be more emphasis on male mental health. It's the biggest killer amongst men and as a man, we shouldn't be afraid to show our feelings. The culture of maschismo which sadly is a part of the fabric in some communities across the country needs to die down. You can be masculine and cry guys!

Covid probably had a part to play with some of these figures, especially with those who were made homeless due to lockdown (the first one in March 2020 was strict!) or in a terrible situation at home. It was a very difficult situation and affected many people's mental health.

There needs to be more safety for girls and women. It's worrying to see how many missing girls are sexually exploited and something needs to be addressed about this. It's time people learned to respect women and girls and tougher punishments were put in force.

In the case of UDIs (Does), as I say with every post - there's got to be someone out there missing them. It's sad how so few get identified and you'd think with advances in technology, science and DNA we'd have some resolution with these. I'd love to wake up one day and find out on here or on a news website that the Clifton Suspension Bridge Doe has been formally identified or the Handsworth Park Doe has too. Whilst in the majority of these cases, time has passed - it's only right they have their names back!

Again, whilst this isn't anything too gritty and an opinion on a case - I hope this is fascinating for people to read and view the stats in full and base their opinions on this.",UnresolvedMysteries,Results of UK Missing Persons Unit Statistics 2019/20 - Reasons why people go missing and stats regarding UDIs by each UK force,0

21 year old Zack Lefave missing on New Years 2021. got most of my information from Bring Zack Lefave Home Facebook (Source). By all accounts a great person who’s family and community are missing him dearly. He was hardworking and didn’t get into trouble, he worked at Red and White Grocery store in town behind the meat cutting counter. He was a homebody who liked to play video games with his friends. He always made sure other people’s needs were taken care of before his own. And a lot of the pictures I found of him looks like he was great with kids.

Zack LeFave disappeared mysteriously on New Years day. He was 4-wheeling with his friends up until 4pm that day. At 6pm he went to The Grand hotel on Main Street because a couple friends had a room there. From there they went to a part, which was about a 15 minute drive to Plymouth, they took a cab. The party was comprised of about 20 people, he didn’t really know anyone there. They arrive at the party at 11:25pm.

A friend who saw him says he was drunk, but a happy outgoing drunk, not like passed out, falling asleep drunk. At this party there were fishermen who were on call and had to go into work to catch fish, which is interesting there are on call fisherman on New Years and they were most likely drinking when they had to go into work. He decides to leave and walk home at 11:49pm.

11:49pm: 1st phone call using Facebook messenger to the friends at the party where he says he is in Quinton, which is a 5 hour walk from where he is from (Source) he says he is walking to Yarmouth from Quinton, which is a 6 your walk from Quinton (Source). There’s

NO WAY he’s in Quinton Nova Scotia thet fast so he sounds disoriented. Even still if he’s walking from Plymouth to Yarmouth it’s a 2.5 hour walk. During this phone call he jokes around and says he’s not wearing any pants and doesn’t seemed distressed. His pants were later found on Flint road along with his wallet, his hat, and his cigarettes.

11:54pm – Second phone call, says he is cold, thinks he is Quinton, not distressed.

11:58pm- phone call ends.

12:02pm – Disturbing phone cal where he says he is with PoC (black people) he doesn’t know, the phone call cuts off.

12:07 – last phone call and no one picks up.

12am: 1st eye witness sees him at Newell Road entrance

12:15am: 1st driver, sees him walking with traffic

12:15am: 2nd driver, same as above

12:25am Zack is seen walking again by the 1st eyewitness (he was going the wrong way and turned around)

12:45am: 1st driver from 12:15am returns back and doesn’t seem him

12:45am-1:00am: 2nd driver returns and doesn’t see Zack

12:25am-12:45am: Something happened to zack with this area (Source)

Zack was reported missing 2 hours after he left the party

An extensive search was done on January 2nd including ground and water searches, but no trace of Zack was ever found

The search was suspended and the family took over and did a thorough job

Theories

Hit and Run

Zack was walking alone drunk on the side of a highway one New Years Eve where people might have been drinking and driving. At 4am that morning a family member went to go look for Zack. No signs of hit and run such as blood on the street

Foul Play

His girlfriend Hanna says she got his phone records and there was an anonymous number with an unknown location was texting him. A family friend says there are a few names that keep popping up. Colton Cook was murdered in the area in September 2020 by 2 people who were apprehended.

I believe it’s possible that these texts were him arranging to possibly meet up with someone. His wallet was found along with his pants.

This reminds me of the Luke Joly-Durocher who’s dissapeared in North Bay, Ontario and who’s debit card was found in a snow bank down the street from his last known location. One of the prevailing theories is that he was met with foul play because he didn’t have cash on hand.

The family is searching for answers.

There is a $30,000 reward.

413,SniffleBot,1640812691,"Yesterday evening, it was announced [that by a 4-3 margin the New Jersey Supreme Court had vacated the 2016 murder conviction](https://www.nj.com/news/2021/12/michelle-lodzinski-leaves-prison-hours-after-nj-supreme-court-tosses-her-murder-conviction.html) of Michelle Lodzinski for [the 1991 death of her 5-year-old son, Timothy Wiltsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Timothy_Wiltsey). The majority found the evidence insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Lodzinski had committed murder.

To [recap](https://www.nj.com/news/2021/05/its-been-30-years-since-5-year-old-timothy-wiltsey-was-killed-the-case-against-his-mother-is-still-ongoing.html):

On May 25, 1991, Lodzinksi, then a resident of South Amboy, took the boy, whom she had been raising as a single mother after having divorced his father and returning to NJ following a brief marriage in Iowa, to a Memorial Day weekend carnival in nearby Sayreville. While some doubt has been expressed about this, neighbors did see the two leave the house that day.

After she took him on three rides, they went for some ice cream, right around sunset. He was, she said, right behind her in line as she ordered and paid for two cones. He was there, and, five seconds later when she looked back, he was gone. She couldn't find him in the nearby crowd, so she went to the police to report a missing child. The search, until 2 a.m.,  eventually forced the carnival to close early; it was resumed at dawn.

Police searched the entire 10-acre park where the carnival was held, with helicopters and dogs augmenting the foot presence. There was no trace of Tim; they said later they were satisfied that if he was anywhere he wasn't in the park, and the efforts turned to the usual massive news coverage and people handing out fliers everywhere. *America's Most Wanted* featured the case. Wiltsey's father was back in Iowa the whole time and quickly ruled out as a suspect.

But over the next couple of weeks, the police began to have doubts. Within the first three weeks of the investigation, she changed her story twice.

First, she came clean and ""admitted"" that she'd run into some woman named ""Ellen"" who she used to see at the bank where she worked as a teller, accompanied by a man she hadn't seen before; she thought Ellen worked as a go-go dancer somewhere, or at least had, and she didn't know/remember the woman's last name. Ellen offered to briefly watch Tim while she got the ice cream, but when she came back Ellen, the man, and her son were all gone. She just didn't want to tell *anyone* that she'd left her son in the (however brief) care of someone she didn't know well.

OK. So the police took the clues that she gave and tried to find Ellen. Apparently they didn't get anything that might have been a result, so they went back and confronted Lodzinski with this a week later. This time she said that the man had put a knife to her throat and told her not to tell anyone what had happened; she'd get her son back in a month if she stayed quiet, and this was what she was *really* afraid of. This breakthrough came after hours of questioning that ended with Lodzinski going to the hospital for hyperventilation.

On the other side, Lodzinski and her relatives told the police that at the time her plans for the near future definitely included Timmy: she'd gotten his kindergarten graduation gown, and made plans for the two of them to visit family in Florida.

The summer wore on and Wiltsey's face was put on tons of milk cartons around the state. But Lodzinski herself rarely appeared, and when she did seemed rather unemotional. She blamed the media, saying at one press conference in the fall that she didn't get emotional in public and wasn't about to start so they could have visual of her crying. She announced she might well be moving to get away from them.

In October, a sneaker matching Lodzinski's description of the ones her son had been wearing when he went missing was found near the woods at the back of an office park in nearby Edison. This led to the discovery of Tim's body in a muddy brook in those woods, near the Raritan River, the next April, nearly 11 months to the day after he went missing. The remains were too decomposed to determine the cause of death.

He was buried the next month. A week later, the police made public the twists and turns in Lodzinski's story from a year earlier, as well as the fact that she had only told them after the body was discovered that she had once worked in the nearby office park, and that she had failed two lie detector tests (inadmissible as evidence in NJ in any event). Her public sympathy took a huge hit, but there was no break in the case.

What there *would* be was another case. For a day, Michelle herself became a missing person. In January 1994 her brother found her car out in front of his apartment in another town in northeastern Middlesex County with the door open and the engine running. The very next day she was found in downtown Detroit, where she told police she had been abducted by some guys claiming to be FBI and taken the several hundred miles there. The real FBI didn't believe this.

It turned out later that this happened right after she had learned that she was about to be subpoenaed. Not in her son's case, but in that of a friend, a cop in a neighboring county who had apparently been running plates for her of vehicles she suspected of following her around. In any state this is actionable misuse of that data base.

A grand jury no-billed him, but in March 1995 Lodzinski pled guilty to having falsified the kidnapping after having taken a bus to Detroit. She got three years probation and modified house arrest.

But she couldn't stay out of trouble. Three years later she was in criminal court again, charged with stealing a $3,100 laptop (wow ... those *were* the days!) from a former (emphasis *former*) employer so she could give it to someone as a Christmas gift. She again pled guilty, and got another three-years stretch of probation plus a day ... a whole *day* ... in jail for violating her previous probation, followed by four months of unambiguous house arrest at a time when you couldn't work from home so easily.

After that was over, she must have decided she'd had it with New Jersey, moving to Minnesota and then, eventually, Florida, where she again married briefly and had two more children, who are both still alive (both of whom she told of Timmy, whose pictures she still kept around the house). She told a newspaper reporter who caught up with her that while she'd always have a past, she was otherwise just like anyone else around her and her life was getting back to normal again.

In the early 2010s the county prosecutor's office decided to take a serious look at the case again, offering a reward for any new information that could solve the case. Suspicion of Lodzinski had only increased with her late '90s shenanigans, and it must have gotten old having to say again and again that there wasn't enough evidence to charge her, as much as that was true. In the evidence they thought they had found their smoking gun: a blanket found near the body that three former babysitters and family members said was one they'd seen in her house before Wiltsey disappeared.

So, in 2014, they trooped down to Port St. Lucie with an arrest warrant based on a sealed indictment and brought Lodzinski back to New Jersey in cuffs to face trial. Her lawyers, as lawyers often do, made a whole host of motions to prevent that trial from even starting. The primary one was that the evidence was not only insufficient to convict on its face, it wasn't enough even for an indictment. It took over a year for the trial judge to rule in the prosecution's favor on that one, saying that even though the case was largely circumstantial the shortfall in evidence was not ""egregious"".

After that, trial finally got underway in March 2016. The blanket and the related witnesses were the centerpiece of the state's case, with the argument that the social and economic pressures of single motherhood were motive enough (*à la* Casey Anthony) for her to kill her son. Her defense argued that the blanket was a red herring, and that the site where the body was discovered was tainted as the police had made serious mistakes processing it. The jury foreman was dismissed after it was discovered that he was independently investigating the case online; the defense motion for a mistrial was denied. Lodzinski did not take the stand.

Lodzinski was convicted after two months and sentenced in September to 30 years without parole, the minimum sentence for murder in New Jersey. She appealed, an arguing the evidence was insufficient, but [in 2019 an appellate court sustained the conviction](https://www.nj.com/news/2019/08/court-upholds-lodzinskis-conviction-in-decades-old-nj-murder-of-her-young-son.html). She and her lawyers decided to continue to the state Supreme Court.

In 2021 that court agreed to hear the case. The Chief Justice recused himself, for reasons undisclosed because like U.S. Supreme Court justices New Jersey's aren't required to explain why they have chosen to recuse themselves. The remaining six justices deadlocked, leaving the previous appeal intact and Lodzinski in prison.

At this point, in one of those plot twists that you'd walk out of a movie if it happened there, her lawyers got the state Supreme Court to invoke a rarely-used rule that allows it to grant a rehearing in such a case if it can appoint a substitute justice. That judge, a chief judge from the state's appellate courts, broke the tie in favor of [vacating the conviction for insufficient evidence](https://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/assets/opinions/supreme/a_50_19.pdf?c=OZS) and, after it was announced yesterday, she walked out of prison, never to have to face criminal prosecution for her son's death again (Although the taint of suspicion will always linger, I'm sure).

Now that this case is formally back to being a unsolved death again, I looked around to see if it had been discussed here before and found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4lh38r/michelle_lodzinski_has_this_25_year_cold_case/) from five and a half years ago when Lodzinski was convicted. The OP doesn't seem quite sure about the conviction, and some of the comments seem like their authors would not be at all surprised that it's ended this way (well, the prosecution *could* appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but given that this appeal was primarily granted based on a factual issue it is extremely unlikely to me that a cert petition would get even *one* justice interested, to say nothing of four. But ... the state has five months).

So ... today, what do we think?

For my part I agree with the NJSC majority but *only* in the sense that the prosecution did not overcome reasonable doubt. Too much of the circumstantial evidence requires conjecture and speculation to get to murder, especially given that we are not even certain of *when* Wiltsey died and do not know how. The blanket was a start toward making a case, but I would have wanted to see better proof that the blanket could only have come from Lodzinski's house. How rare was it?

But this case isn't one where I am comfortable in rejoicing that a wrongly convicted innocent has seen justice served. I would still consider Michelle a person of interest at least, and frankly if a jury could have been allowed to choose the old Scottish verdict of ""not proven"", I would be comfortable with that. Because with the same eye that I agree that there isn't enough evidence to sustain a conviction, there also isn't enough evidence to make me comfortable excluding her, or coming up with an alternate theory that implicates someone or something else. And ... after all, we *know* because she *pleaded guilty* to it that she went to some lengths to make it look like she herself had been kidnapped.

Is there any possibility of a third theory to all this? That while she might not be directly responsible for her son's death, she may know something that she's withheld all these years that, while it might have more definitely acquitted her of murder, would not have been something she'd want the public to know about her? (The two later versions of her story, making it look more like an abduction, seem to hint at this). Anyone have any ideas?",UnresolvedMysteries,"New Jersey Supreme Court vacates Michelle Lodzinski's conviction; death of her son, Timothy Wiltsey, now officially unsolved again",0
414,bizzbuzzbizzbuzz,1640807942,"Starting in 1976, the small town of Circleville, Ohio has been plagued by a mystery that has yet to be solved – a series of anonymous letters sent to Circleville residents claiming to know their deepest, darkest secrets and threatening to expose them to the town. These letters sent shockwaves through the town and ignited a series of events that would result in accusations of murder, adultery, and other bizarre happenings.

**The Bus Driver &amp; the Superintendent**

On March 3, 1977, a letter arrived at Westfall High School addressed to school superintendent [Gordon Massie](https://imgur.com/iwEVOfd). The letter was hand written in a distinctive block letter style and accused Massie of having an affair with a married school bus driver in Circleville. The writer told Massie to confess his affairs to the school board. The very next day, the writer sent a letter to the Westfall School Board telling them about Massie’s affair with one of the drivers. These letters, as well as all of the Circleville letters, were [postmarked Columbus, Ohio](https://imgur.com/lr0oQ4v), which is about 25 miles north of Circleville.

The main target of the writer’s harassment would turn out to be one of these bus drivers, [Mary Gillispie](https://imgur.com/xV012co). Near the start of the letter writer’s campaign of harassment, Mary Gillispie found a [handwritten letter](https://imgur.com/i6I8eUO) in her mailbox accusing her of having an affair with Gordon Massie. In this first letter, the writer claimed they had been “observing \[Mary\] and her children” and stated that “everyone concerned had been notified and everything will be over soon.” At this point, Mary shared the letter with her husband, Ron Gillispie, but denied she was having an affair with Gordon Massie.

A short time later in March 1977, Ron received [another letter–](https://imgur.com/D0znLQy)this one telling him that he needed to admit that his wife was having an affair with Massie. The letter told him to inform the Westfall school board of the affair and said that, if he did not, he would be killed. Once again, the Gillispies kept this letter quiet. Two weeks later, another letter was sent to the Gillispies; once again, the writer addressed Ron, telling him: “you have had 2 weeks and done nothing. Make \[Mary\] admit the truth and inform the school board.” At this point, both Mary and Ron had received letters threatening them and their children if Mary didn’t admit to the affair with Gordon Massie. In addition to the letters, there were also phone calls to the Gillispie home and offensive signs posted along Mary’s bus route; many of these signs made offensive/explicit references to the Gillispie’s young daughter.

From the beginning, Mary suspected the letters were being sent by David Longberry, a fellow bus driver who had expressed romantic interest in her and whom she had rejected. Determined to get to the bottom of who was writing the letters, Mary and Ron reached out to Ron’s sister, Karen Freshour, and her husband, [Paul](https://imgur.com/hDxB1KS). Paul’s sister was also told about the letters, but at this time, no one else knew about them. Since Mary believed David Longberry was the writer, the five of them (the Gillispies, the Freshour, and Paul’s sister) decided to write their own letter to David, telling him they knew he was the writer. The letters stopped for a few weeks, so they thought they had identified the writer and put a stop to the letters. But a few weeks later, the letters resumed and a tragedy occured.

**An Accident–or Murder?**

On August 19, 1977, Ron received a phone call at home that enraged him. He told his daughter that the call was from the letter writer, and he got his gun, ran to his truck, and drove off into the night.  Ron Gillispie’s [truck was found at 10:35pm that night crashed into a tree](https://imgur.com/9X7yW5m) with Ron’s body inside; he had died of major internal injuries.

Many Circleville residents believed that Ron’s death was not an accident–it was murder. After all, the letter writer had threatened Ron’s life if he didn’t expose his wife’s affair. In particular, Ron’s brother-in-law, Paul Freshour, believed that Ron had been murdered after uncovering the identity of the letter writer. There were essentially two pieces of evidence that supported the murder theory: 1) Ron was not a heavy drinker, but his blood alcohol level was 1.5x the acceptable amount, and 2) Ron’s gun was found under his body, and it appeared that one round had been fired sometime between when he left his house and his body was found.

The sheriff at the time, Dwight Radcliff, originally suspected foul play was involved in Ron’s death and there was even a person of interest in the case who was interviewed and given a polygraph test (which they passed; the person of interest has never publicly been identified). But after the coroner, Dr. Ray Caroll, examined the body, and found the high blood alcohol level, Sheriff Radcliff changed his mind and believed Ron’s death was an accident caused by drunk driving.

But apparently Sheriff Radcliff had motivation to cover up a possible murder as he was running for President of the National Sheriff’s Association, and a town plagued by not only an unhinged letter writer, but one who had turned to murder, wouldn’t be a good look for the President of this organization. The letter writer was also frustrated by the lack of investigation into the case and [wrote letters claiming that Sheriff Radcliff was covering up the truth of Ron’s death](https://imgur.com/gBpyAeC). Letters also accused Dr. Caroll, the coroner, of sexual abuse of young children.

After Ron’s death, the harassment continued, with letters being sent not just to Mary, but to citizens around town, to the newspaper, to local businesses, to schools–-basically to everyone in Circleville. Other residents were scared since the letter writer seemed completely unhinged and knew details of their lives that a stranger should have no way of knowing. Meanwhile, [Paul Freshour continued to insist that Ron had been murdered](https://imgur.com/5xnYfc8) and even filed a report requesting that the FBI investigate Ron’s death.

And though Mary had always denied having an affair with Gordon Massie while her husband was alive, after his death, she and Massie did begin a romantic relationship. At this point, the threats against her became more vicious, including explicit threats against Mary’s daughter.

**A Break in the Case**

On February 7, 1983, Mary was driving her school bus near Five Points Pike, when she saw a sign posted along a nearby fence. The sign was handwritten and included an obscene message about Mary’s 13 year-old daughter. Mary pulled over and attempted to remove the sign, but when she pulled on it, she saw that it was attached to a box with some twine. Mary decided to take the box home, and when she opened it she found a gun inside. Mary brought the box to the sheriff’s office, who determined the box was a booby trap that had been designed to fire the gun when the sign was pulled down. For some reason, the booby trap did not trigger when Mary removed the sign.

This booby trap became the first real break in the case, as the sheriff’s office was able to identify the gun used in the booby trap as belonging to Paul Freshour. Paul admitted the gun was his, but claimed it had gone missing weeks before, and denied setting the trap; he had also not reported the gun missing prior to this, so there was no evidence to support his claim.

The sheriff’s office then told Paul to copy one of the Circleville letters and try to emulate the handwriting of the letter–a practice that is very much not proper procedure when comparing handwriting. Usually, the suspect is asked to write a sample in his own handwriting, not to attempt to copy the handwriting. In addition to the handwriting sample, Ron Freshour failed a polygraph test and his ex-wife, Karen, told police he was behind the letters to Mary. Karen was the first to link Paul to the letters.

But, as with everything with this case, there’s more to the story. Karen and Paul had recently gone through an acrimonious divorce after Karen cheated on Paul. Paul was awarded custody of their three children and Karen ended up living in a trailer in Mary Gillispie’s backyard, so Karen certainly seems to have a motive for framing Paul. She also would have had access to his gun. And despite telling police that she had access to the letters, including letters Paul had written and not mailed, she could not produce any of these, telling police that she had disposed of them.

As for additional evidence connecting Paul to the booby trap, there was none. Paul had an alibi for the day the booby trap was set; he was at home because there was work being done on his house. Paul also fully cooperated with law enforcement and was only connected to the letters based on an accusation from his ex-wife after a very contentious divorce.

Using Karen’s testimony, the copied letters, the failed polygraph, and the fact that the gun in the box was registered to Paul Freshour, he was charged with attempted murder of Mary Gillispie. Paul was never charged with sending any of the letters, but they were used as evidence against him in his trial. There was also no physical evidence connecting Paul to either the letters or the booby trap. But he was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 7-25 years in prison.

**Case Closed?**

At this point, it seemed as though the mystery of the Circleville Writer had been solved. The only problem with this theory? The letters continued even after Paul Freshour was imprisoned. Even Paul himself received a letter, this one stating “Now when are you going to believe you aren’t going to get out of there? I told you two years ago. When we set ‘em up, they stay set up. Don’t you listen at all?”

Now, clearly, it is possible for people in prison to write and send letters, so the prison took numerous measures to ensure that Paul could not write these letters while in prison. These measures included putting Paul in solitary confinement, where he had no access to pen, paper, or the mail. And yet, letters continued to be sent during this time. Repeated sweeps of Paul Freshour’s cell showed no evidence that he wrote any of these letters in prison, he was regularly strip searched, and all of his incoming and outgoing mail was examined. Eventually, the prison warden wrote a letter to Paul’s ex-wife Karen telling her that it was impossible that Paul was writing these letters from his cell.

Additionally, Paul Freshour was imprisoned in Lima, Ohio, but all the letters (dating back from the first letters sent in 1976) were postmarked in Columbus, Ohio, so it is not clear how letters sent from a prison in Lima to Circleville would be postmarked Columbus.

In 1993, the television show *Unsolved Mysteries* was set to air a segment on the Circleville Letter Writer. Prior to the filming of this episode, the producers of the show received a postcard that said: ""Forget Circleville, Ohio. ... If you come to Ohio, you el sickos will pay. The Circleville writer."" The producers were undeterred and the segment was filmed and broadcast, including an interview with Paul Freshour, who had just been released on parole. This postcard was one of the final communications sent from the Circleville Letter Writer. No letters were sent after 1994.

**The Writer Unmasked?**

In August 2021, the CBS show *48 Hours* aired an episode that they claimed definitively identified the Circleville Letter Writer through forensic document examination. CBS hired a document examiner, Beverley East, who compared the Circleville Letters to Paul Freshour’s known handwriting. She found numerous links between the letter writer’s handwriting and Paul’s handwriting, especially in the formation of his numbers. East said there were patterns in the anonymous letters that did not match Paul’s handwriting, but found more than 100 “quirks” of Paul’s writing that did match.

However, not all of the experts agree that Paul Freshour is responsible for writing the letters. Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole does not believe there is enough evidence to state that Paul was the letter writer. In particular, O’Toole points to the letters that were sent while Paul was in prison. Since it was physically impossible for Paul to write and send these letters, it seems clear that there had to be another person involved. It should be noted that there were not just a couple of letters sent during the 10 years of Paul’s incarceration, but that there were literally hundreds of letters sent to people all over central Ohio. O’Toole also believes the letters were written by a female writer and that the letter writer was not well educated. Paul Freshour had three college degrees, including a Master’s degree.

So, despite the claims of *48 Hours*, it is clear that they did not, in fact, definitively identify the letter writer. The question of who wrote the letters, who set the booby trap for Mary Gillispie, and whether Ron Gillispie died as a result of an accident or foul play has yet to be answered even 45 years later.

**Some Additional Information**

Paul Freshour was released on parole in 1994 after spending 10 years in prison. He maintained his innocence until his death in 2012 at the age of 70. After his release, he maintained a [website dedicated to professing his innocence](https://circlevilleletters.wordpress.com/).

Dr. Ray Caroll, the county coroner who claimed that Ron Gillispie died with a BAC of 2x the legal limit, and who was accused by the Circleville Writer of child molestation, was charged with 12 counts of gross immorality, sex crimes, corruption of a minor, pornography, obscenity, and indecent exposure in December 1993.

David Longberry, the school bus driver Mary Gillispie originally suspected of writing the letters back in 1977, raped an 11 year-old girl in 1999. He went on the run and is still currently a fugitive.

The letter writer also made accusations against Roger Kline, the prosecutor who helped to convict Paul Freshour, but those are a bit harder to confirm. Specifically, he was accused of having an affair with a schoolteacher and then having her murdered when he found out she was pregnant. But, despite some random couple in Ohio “confirming” this story to a TV news station, there is literally no evidence of this. Kline became an appellate court judge before retiring in 2013.

While Paul was serving his time in prison, a fellow school bus driver of Mary’s came forward and said they had seen a large man with sandy-hair in a yellow El Camino standing at the site of the booby trapped sign on February 7, 1983, about 20 minutes before Mary found the sign. When the bus driver passed by, the man turned away from her so she could not see his face. Paul Freshour has dark hair and is not a large man, so he was clearly not the man that was seen by the bus driver. Karen, Paul’s ex-wife, was, however, dating a man who was large and sandy-haired. Her brother also drove an El Camino. Police chose not to follow up on this tip.

**Final Thoughts**

While Paul Freshour was convicted of setting the booby trap intended to kill Mary Gillispie in part based on the anonymous letters, neither he, nor anyone else, has ever been charged with writing the Circleville letters. Additionally, Paul Freshour’s conviction was based solely  on circumstantial evidence. And, while Paul’s conviction relied on the idea that he was the letter writer (and that the letter writer and the person who set the booby trap were one and the same), it is impossible that he is responsible the hundreds of letters that were sent while he was in prison. One theory of the letters is that there were multiple letter writers, not just one. This would explain how the letter writer knew secrets about such a large group of people (literally hundreds of people in Central Ohio received these letters) as well as how the letters continued after Paul Freshour was put in prison. While it's unlikely that there would be numerous letter writers who all managed to keep this huge secret for over 40 years, it's not possible to rule it out.

Another odd element of this case is the glaring absence of Gordon Massie from all of the reporting of the events. The most vitriolic letters were sent to or about Massie; the sign that was booby-trapped included a message that Mary’s 12 year-old daughter was involved in a sexual relationship with Massie. Massie was also the target of the early letters and, despite Mary Gillispie’s denial of an affair with Massie, the two did have a romantic relationship after Ron’s death. And yet, there is very little information about Massie available, despite the huge amounts of information for many of the other people involved in the case. Massie was a well-respected member of the Circleville community and was married with a son. He died in 1996.

No letters have been sent since 1994 and a number of the people involved in the case have since died. And yet no one has ever come forward with any information about the Circleville Letter Writer, so it seems that this is one mystery that may never be solved.

416,VastArt663,1640803840,"Suzanne Jovin was Born on January, 26, 1977 who was a German born American senior who studied at the Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. 

Murder 

Suzanne Jovin Was dropping off the penultimate draft of her senior essay on the terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden. Approximately at 4:15 pm on Friday Of December,4 1998 Suzanne was making Preparations for a pizza making party which she organized at the trinity Lutheran church on 292 Orange street for the Local chapter of Best Buddies a International organization that brings together students and mentally disabled adults. By 8:30 after she stayed up late to help clean up. She was driving a another volunteer home in a Borrowed University station wagon. At Approximately 8:45  she returned to her car to yale owned lot on the corner of Edgewood and howe street  and she proceeded to walk two blocks to her second block apartment at 258 Park street upstairs from yale Police Substation. Sometime prior on 8:50 pm A few friends of Jovin had passed by to her window and had asked her if she wanted to join them to watch a  movies with them.  Jovin Declined stating that she planned to do school work that night. At 9:02 Jovin logged onto her Yale Email account and told a female friend of hers in German that she was going to leave some GRE books for her own in Jovin\`s apartment buildings lobby. A unknown person who was unnamed offered to borrow the books from her and she gave her code to her door however that unnamed person wasn\`t identified. 

  Shortly after Jovin headed out on foot to the Yale police communications center under the arch at Phelps Gate on Yale's Old Campus to return the keys to the car she had borrowed. Shortly before reaching her destination, around 9:22, Jovin encountered her classmate Peter Stein, who was out for a walk. Stein is quoted by the Yale Daily news as saying, ""She did not mention plans to go anywhere or do anything else afterward. She just said that she was very, very tired and that she was looking forward to getting a lot of sleep.""[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-4) Stein also said Jovin was not wearing a backpack, was holding one or more sheets of white 8 ½ x 11 inch paper in her right hand, that she was walking at a ""normal"" pace and did not look nervous or excited, and that their encounter lasted only two to three minutes.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-5)

Based on that timeline, Jovin is presumed to have returned the keys to the borrowed car at about 9:25. She was reportedly last seen alive at between 9:25–9:30 by another Yale student, on foot returning from a Yale hockey game, ""walking north on College Street"".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-VF-2) However, it was later clarified, ""It is unclear... whether Jovin was walking somewhere, waiting for someone or pausing to admire the holiday lights along the New Haven Green.

At 9:55 pm, The police were called after a passerby witnessed a  woman bleeding at the corner of Edgehill Road and East Rock Road, 1.9 miles from the Yale campus, where Jovin was last seen alive. When police arrived at 9:58, they found Jovin fatally stabbed 17 times in the back of her head and neck and her throat slit. She was lying on her stomach, feet in the road, body on the grassy area between the road and the sidewalk. She was fully clothed and still wearing her watch and earrings, with a crumpled dollar bill in her pocket. Her wallet was later found to be still in her room. Suzanne Jovin was officially pronounced dead at 10:26 pm at Yale New Haven Hospital. 

Items and Observations were reported by police as evidence  by the Police and media however none of it has been discredited, deemed Hearsay or Unreliable  and explained. One of the Physical evidence found by authorities was DNA  which were found in the scrapings  taken from the fingernail of Jovin\`s left hand, Fingerprints  and a Unknown person partial  palmprint was also found  

on a Fresca bottle in the bushes in front of where her body was found,[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com1-8) and 3) the tip of the knife used in the attack that was lodged in her skull.

The most notable observations appear to be 1) ""a tan or brown van stopped in the roadway facing east, immediately adjacent to where Suzanne was found."",[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-10) 2) ""a man in his 20s or 30s with an athletic build, well-groomed hair, dark pants, a loose-fitting greenish jacket, running like his life depended on it in the opposite direction from where Suzanne Jovin was killed"",[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com2-11) and 3) ""A mysterious, nondescript 'someone,' whom Jovin mentioned in an e-mail she sent less than an hour before she was found stabbed"" to whom she had lent a friend's [GRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRE) test study materials.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-YDN1-3)

The only speculation about the murder weapon came on the March 1, 2000 broadcast of [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company)'s [*20/20*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20/20_(U.S._TV_series)). According to host John Miller's voiceover: ""The medical examiner would later identify only one of the 17 stab wounds as fatal. He would also determine that the murder weapon was a four to five inch nonserrated, carbon steel knife, when he discovered the tip of the blade lodged in the left side of her skull.""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com-6) The New Haven police have never revealed whether any tests have ever been done to determine a precise make and model of the knife.

Though there have been no reports of anyone witnessing Jovin enter or exit any vehicle, it is generally assumed that Jovin had either forcibly or voluntarily entered one, as it was virtually impossible for her to have reached the intersection of Edgehill and East Rock Roads by foot in the short span of time that elapsed between when she was last seen alive and when she was found bleeding by witnesses nearly two miles away. The existence of the tan/brown van was not made public by the [New Haven Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Police_Department) (NHPD) until March 27, 2001. Although members of the Yale faculty had reported the police were asking privately about the van at the inception of the investigation, no explanation has ever been given why it took more than two years to release the information to the public. And although the [*New Haven Register*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Register) reported on November 8, 2001, that the NHPD had impounded a brown van as part of the Jovin investigation, no link has ever been confirmed.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-12)

The existence of the Fresca bottle came to light on April 1, 2001, by [*Hartford Courant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Courant) reporter Les Gura.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-13) The only store in the vicinity of campus that sold Fresca that was still open at the hour Jovin was last seen alive was Krauszer's Market on York Street near Elm Street – precisely one block south of Jovin's apartment. Although Krauszer's maintained a video recording of its customers for security purposes, the police never asked to view their tape and have never reported seeking assistance from store employees or customers about whether they had seen anything unusual that night. The foreign palmprint has yet to be identified and public calls for DNA evidence to be extracted from it and other potential sources have gone unheeded.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-14)

The first mention of the existence of the fingernail DNA was on October 26, 2001, following a solicitation by the New Haven police for colleagues, friends and acquaintances of Jovin to come forward and give DNA samples voluntarily.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-15) No explanation has ever been given as to why it took nearly three years for the fingernail scrapings to be tested for DNA. On September 14, 2009, Jovin's parents wrote to Connecticut Governor [M. Jodi Rell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Jodi_Rell) that ""potential forensic investigations, made possible by significant advances in technology in the intervening decade, are not being carried out due to shortcomings in the Connecticut Forensic Science Laboratory."" Rell's office admitted that the lab also had a backlog of 12,000 DNA samples that needed to be tested.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-16) The DNA results from material collected under a fingernail of Jovin's left hand remained unmatched until November 2009. It was determined at that time that the DNA matched that of a trace evidence technician in the Connecticut State Police Forensics Laboratory, and was the result of accidental evidence contamination at the lab.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-17)

At the end of June 2008, the Jovin Task Force revealed that only days after the crime: ""A female motorist told police at the time that she was driving in the area of Whitney Avenue and Huntington Street at about 10 p.m. when she saw a white male sprint past her and disappear into the church property.""[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-siliconinvestor.com2-11) As for why this testimony was withheld from the public for nearly a decade: ""Sources said the police at the time showed her a photo of Yale Professor James Van de Velde — Jovin's thesis adviser, whom police had publicly identified as a suspect — to determine if he was the man she saw. They also took her in an unmarked van to Van de Velde's office so she could look at him in person. She told them Van de Velde was not the man she saw running, and investigators didn't contact her again, sources said.""[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-18) Subsequently, the Jovin Task Force began hanging a sketch of this person around the neighborhood in which he was spotted.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 16, 2008, the Jovin Task Force provided further details of Jovin's final email, written in German to a female friend, about [GRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRE) test study materials Jovin would leave for her to pick up. ""Jovin wrote that she would retrieve the books and leave them in the foyer of her apartment for the classmate to pick up, giving her classmate the code to her apartment in case Jovin was not in the building.""[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suzanne_Jovin#cite_note-YDN1-3) The materials were never returned, nor has anyone ever come forward as the borrower, leading many to speculate the borrower may have possibly been involved in her killing. Furthermore, Jovin's specific use of the word ""someone"" when referring to the borrower implies to many she did not know this borrower very well.

## 

Four days after the murder, the name of Jovin's thesis advisor, James Van de Velde, was leaked to the as the prime suspect in the case. Fifteen months later, criminologist John Pleckaitis, then a sergeant at the New Haven Police Department, admitted to Hartford Courant reporter Les Gura: ""From a physical evidence point of view, we had nothing to tie him to the case ... I had nothing to link him to the crime."" Famed criminologist Henry Lee\`s offer to reconstruct the crime scene was accepted by the police but not carried out. What\`s even more interesting is that James Van de Velde was a Ph d  in international  security studies. In 1988 he was selected for a prestigious [Presidential Management Internship](http://www.fbi.gov/employment/presin.htm) for those interested in and committed to a career in federal government. He was appointed to work at the Pentagon and State Department by the first Bush administration for nuclear weapons arms control. He was also a lieutenant commander in the **U.S. Naval Intelligence** Reserves. He [worked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Jovin_case) on the Dayton Peace Accords in 1997 as a mobilized reservist performing a voluntary active duty assignment for the U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command. He’s analyzed the drug trade out of Latin America. Students reportedly  heard **rumors that he worked for the C.I.A.  James Van de** Was the executive director at Stanford's [Asia-Pacific Research Center](http://aparc.stanford.edu/docs/about/) And perhaps the most eye-opening, he **had a** [**security clearance five levels above top secret**](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=23721)

417,ryanderloewe,1640787669,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, considering the 340-letter cipher has been deciphered, I figured I would have a go cracking one of the unsolved ones.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, bear in mind before I get shredded, mocked and all of those wonderful ways which Redditors love to employ to not take it seriously, I had not really known of the suspects except for ALA and EVB and most certainly didn't see any pictures except for the former.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Before I reveal who I think it was, I will just mention that the profile of the guy and his history fits what was written in the ciphers like a hand into the glove.

&amp;#x200B;

When I saw the picture after working out the cipher, it couldn't be anybody else. There is a lot of speculation and just about everything fits. In the second cipher, we read some letters that didn't make sense, until now: NOSROV.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, indeed, there is a name in the 13-letter cipher and it follows two patterns: one is a misspelling and second is a repeated character. Now, we can't do any fancy sleuthing with this cipher such as reading or diagonally, but there is a method.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I actually think that whilst the cipher decoders have done a good job, I think people are applying logic of normal people and not looking at the logic of an abnormal person. The zodiac kille wanted to be identified and I think for him, there was no fancy cryptography device or code that needed to be used - just some theory about various types pf cryptography

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't used anything except trying to connect the dots and follow what is consistent rather than what is not.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried uploading the image of my notes , in order for you to see my conclusion and reasoning but can't upload it here.

&amp;#x200B;

I conclude the zodiac killer to be Ross Sullivan.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way I can upload the screenshot of my notes?

To illustrate my conclusion, I'll use a substitution for the text:

AEN@0K0M0LNAM

MYENAMEISROSS

&amp;#x200B;

Rearrange it

M0L|NAMA|EN|@0K0

MYE|NAME|IS|ROSS

&amp;#x200B;

The only first name I could think of that is only four letters but has a double letter is Ross.

We have a repeated zodiac letter.

We have the characteristic misspelling.

The method? Shift the letters forward and then rearrange some. I'm sure some people can take what I've got and explain the method in detail. You have to cross six letters and that's it.

Keep one letter the same after doing so, so we have:

M=M

L=Y

0=E

&amp;#x200B;

N=N

A=A

M=M

A=E

&amp;#x200B;

E=I

N=S

&amp;#x200B;

K=R

@=O

0=S

0=S

&amp;#x200B;

Taken from the zodiac wikia..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Evidence against Sullivan

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He was closely linked to the non-canonical Zodiac victim Cheri Jo Bates in 1966.

&amp;#x200B;

He was working at the campus and made people feel uneasy around him.

&amp;#x200B;

He did not show up for work after the Bates Murder and acted rather suspiciously. It is also said that he always wore the same outfit, After the murder he wore a completely new outfit.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn’t just look similar to the sketch; he looks exactly like it. I was shocked enormously at how precise his face is with the composite.

&amp;#x200B;

The same vocabulary and writing style was used in the Confession Letter and the Zodiac Letters.

&amp;#x200B;

People at Riverside have stated that Ross wrote creepy poems.

&amp;#x200B;

He wrote an essay on how to disguise handwriting.

&amp;#x200B;

He moved to Santa Cruz in 1968.

&amp;#x200B;

He died in 1977 which might explain why the murders stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

418,sosotess,1640785108," In 2008, 20-year-old Jérôme mysteriously disappeared. Thirteen years later, bones were found next to the wreck of his car in a ravine, in southern France.

It was a hiker who randomly found the crashed vehicle in the hard to reach area in Sainte-Croix-du-Verdon, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. He then saw the remains and called the police. The car wasn't declared stolen back then although it wasn't registered to Jérôme.

His disappearance hadn't been reported back then. The orphaned young man lived with his uncle and aunt, and since he wasn't a minor anymore, no one thought to report him missing. His uncle did post a missing person notice on a website (www.personnedisparue.com) and the family apparently searched for him on their own. But there was never an official investigation. According to his relatives, Jérôme wasn't suicidal. He probably went off course in a hairpin curve before falling into the ravine. 

His death will most likely be ruled an accident. But at least, law enforcement is at last looking into it and the bones will be analyzed to confirm Jérôme's identity.

423,gaycatdetective,1640748605,"This post is about one victim and two other potential victims of William ""Felix"" Vail Sr., who will be referred to by his middle name, Felix. I will break it down into three sections, one dedicated to each woman. At the time of his conviction, he was considered the oldest **suspected** serial killer (he has never been charged in two of the cases.) Due to the gap in time between the murder and his arrest, this post will be slightly out of chronological order. 

**Mary Elizabeth Horton Vail**

Mary Horton married Felix Vail in July196. In 1962, Mary gave birth to a baby boy, and he was named after his father. (He will be referred to as Billy in this post.) Shortly after Billy's birth, Mary told her family the marriage was a mistake and she wanted to leave Felix. She changed her mind about leaving him, but just two months later she was dead.

According to Felix, on October 28, 1962, he and Mary were running trotlines at night on the Calcasieu River and she fell out of the boat when he swerved to avoid a stump. He was unable to save her.  Her body was found two days later with bruises on her head and neck and a scarf in her mouth. At the time of her death, Mary was just 22 years old and was pregnant with her second child.

Her death was initially ruled an accident, but authorities were suspicious of Felix's story for a number of reasons. The Charley Project states that not only was the portion of the river they were on not suitable for trotlines, but the trotlines had been left in his truck. Mary was also afraid of water, and Felix had traveled several miles downriver to allegedly get help, which would have wasted valuable time. Felix had two life insurance policies totaling $150,000 on Mary. (That would be about half a million in today's money.) One life insurance policy was taken out and paid in full shortly before Mary's death, around the same time she was telling family she had doubts about their marriage. Suspicions about Mary's death prevented him from collecting the full amount.

Felix was eventually arrested on murder charges, and the case was brought before a grand jury in January 1963 - just months after Mary's death. However, the charges were suddenly dropped and the case was closed before he could be indicted. The case would never make it to court and Felix was a free man for another fifty years.

On May 17, 2013, he was arrested for Mary's murder again. Photos of Mary's body when it was found had been re-examined, and a former neighbor of Felix's came forward with a chilling story of what he'd heard decades earlier:

*""He said, 'Well, that damn bitch wanted another baby … thought it might help save our marriage, but said I didn't want the one I got, and I sure didn't want another one.' … he said, 'I fixed that damn bitch. She won't never have another one.""*

Felix also told at least one other witness he had killed his wife, and described it in gruesome detail. He told another wife in the 1970s that he ""could have saved his first wife, but chose not to."" He was convicted of her murder in August 2016 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was upheld in November 2018.

**Sharon Hensley**

Sharon Hensley was from Bismarck, North Dakota but traveled to California. It is alleged that her family sent her to San Francisco to get an abortion and she was very upset about this and wanted to get away from her family. In the late 1960s or 1970, when she was about 18-21, she met and began dating Felix Vail. Felix had moved to California with his son Billy sometime after Mary's death and the charges against him had been dropped. Felix and Sharon hitchhiked around California with Billy in tow. In 1970, when Billy was eight years old, he went to the police and told them a disturbing story. He said his father had been forcing him to take drugs and that he had heard him telling Sharon about how he had killed Mary.

Felix was arrested at this time on drug and child abuse charges, and Billy was sent to live with his mother's family. Authorities from Louisiana tried to talk to Felix about Mary's murder at that time but he refused. A prosecutor declined to file murder charges against him at that time.

Sharon's brother saw a tabloid story about Billy in a supermarket. He had last seen his sister sometime around 1970, and at that time she seemed to be wasting away due to drugs and malnutrition. He believed Felix had total control over her, and that she was too scared to leave him. She fell out of contact with her family, but placed one last phone call to them in February 1973. During this phone call she said she and Felix were possibly traveling to South America.

A year after her last contact with family, they received a letter from Felix stating that he had not seen Sharon in about a year when they were in Key West, FL. According to Felix, she had burned all of her identification and said she wanted to disappear and start a new life. She then left with an Australian couple who were sailing the world. Felix initially said their names were John and Vanessa, but later changed his story and said their names were Frank and Sally.

Due to being out of contact with family, nobody knew Sharon was missing for a year, and was not officially reported missing for over 35 years. When Bill was 13, Felix showed back up in Mississippi without Sharon. He told Bill she would never bother anyone again, and at that time Bill knew she had been murdered. He believed that Felix blamed Sharon for Bill going to the police, and that was his ""excuse"" for killing her.

**Annette Marie Craver Vail**

Annette met Felix in Houston, Texas, when she was just 15 years old. After she graduated high school, they went on a cross country motorcycle trip. They married in 1983, when she was 17 years old and Felix was in his forties. After Annette turned 18, she inherited nearly $100,000 and two homes from her father's estate. (TCP states one of these homes was actually purchased from her mother with her inheritance money.)

A few months after they married, Annette left Felix and moved to Oklahoma to live with her mother. She said she'd had an abortion and wanted to divorce Felix. They reconciled a few weeks later, and Felix was named the sole owner of the home, and Annette's mother was asked to move out. Annette's inheritance money was used to pay off some of Felix's debt, but $41k was left in cash. A few weeks later, Annette disappeared.

She was last seen by her family on October 5, 1984 in Sulphur, Louisiana. Her mother reported her missing on October 22. Felix told neighbors she was visiting friends in Denver, Colorado. 

Felix told police she was mentally ill and had left on her own accord, and had boarded a bus at a Trailways bus station in St. Louis, Missouri bound for Mexico. (There was no Trailways bus station in St. Louis.) He said the last time he saw her, she did not have any false identification and was still using her given name. He also claimed she just wanted to get away from her mother. He said she had new friends who could get her a new identity, and had the $41k in cash with her when she left. He filed for divorce in December 1984.

Felix Vail has made various claims about having made contact with Annette since her disappearance, where she is, and searches he has made for her. None of these claims have ever been verified.

Annette's mother, Rose, never gave up searching for her. She hired private detectives and enlisted the help of a journalist. She learned about Mary's death and Sharon's disappearance and reached out to their families. She also reached out to Felix's family. Her relentless efforts eventually lead to prosecutor's re-examining Mary's death and he was eventually charged.

Felix Vail had at least seven wives. He was convicted in the murder of one, another disappeared, and was physically abusive to at least one other. His son, Bill, always believed he was guilty and made a video detailing everything he'd heard his father say about Mary's murder before his death in 2009. Felix has never been charged in any other disappearance or murder.

425,IndyHen,1640735538,"OK, I'm hoping this one is very solvable, because I truly believe the answer is out there and possibly could be found with deep enough digging in the right place, maybe on the Wayback Machine.

**A brief background**

The Indiana Glass Company operated out of Dunkirk, Indiana from 1907 to 2002.  During that time, they produced millions of pieces of glassware, which have become collectible today.  And perhaps no item they made is more prolific and collectible than the Glass Hen on Nest Covered Dish.

Indiana Glass Hens can be found in flea markets, antique stores, estate sales, and anywhere else where vintage items can be found.  The market is absolutely flooded with them.  Literally millions were made and sold during their heyday (mostly the 70s thru 90s.)  Today they have a very active collector's community, and you can see them selling every day on sites like ebay, etsy, mercari, and many others.

Different colors are more scarce than others, and fetch a higher price.  That being said, even the harder to find colors typically don't go for very much.  With one exception.

**The curious case of the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen**

Indiana Hen collectors are aware of an anomaly: there exists a Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen, which has odd traits, that is *exceptionally* scarce compared to the other colors.  Considered a ""Holy Grail"" item, they always fetch an absurd price on ebay, typically going for $1,000 or more.  People have described to me that they've collected these for 25+ years and never seen a cobalt in person.

**So, what's the mystery here?**

If all there was to this was being a hard to find item, it would require no further thought.  The true mystery here is that the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen is *different* than every other Indiana Glass Hen.  Author Shirley Smith describes this in her *Glass Hen on Nests Covered Dishes Identification Guide* book:

&gt; May or may not have circle on the back.  No small bumps on back end of comb.  Rumored to be slightly larger than other Indiana Hens

In addition to this, those lucky enough to find one have noted that it appears crudely made, and full of flaws.

It's well established in the community that these descriptions hold true.  [Here is a picture of one, with the differences highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/vft7qmf9otk61.png?width=857&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a40a0e69a5fe63f926539952ec13cab2fc8d9a5)

The mysterious thing here is that the Indiana Hen is a factory mass-produced item, made from a mold.  So every Indiana Glass hen is exactly the same, with only the Cobalt Blue one being different.

Mr. Bob Rawlings, the curator at the Indiana Glass Museum in Dunkirk, Indiana, and former factory chief at Indiana Glass has described the circle on the back of the Indiana Hen as being a ""valve mark.""  This was where the valve lifts the glass out of the mold, for an automatic takeout to collect the piece.  [Source](https://glassbottlemarks.com/indiana-glass-company-hen-on-nest-dishes/)

For the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen to *not* have that circle on the back, means at the very minimum it was made in a different manner than all the other hens.  It could also mean it was made by someone else altogether...

**Urban Legends Galore**

Over the years, sellers and collectors of the Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen have told many tall tales to try to describe why it has these differences, and why it might be so scarce.

- It was hand made at the Indiana Glass Gift Shop, not using a machine, which is why it's more crude and full of flaws.

- Cobalt was a difficult color for Indiana Glass to make, so they ran it on a test machine with a lot of problems, then decided not to mass produce it

- Indiana Glass employees would make the hen on their own, unofficially

None of these explanations have ever been officially verified

**What do the experts say?**

Mr. Rawlings has been asked about the Cobalt Indiana Hen many times, and has said that he doesn't remember it being made there, and doesn't know where it came from.  However, this is basically word of mouth and I've never interviewed him personally, so that this one may be taken with a grain of salt.

Another expert--Craig Schenning--the author of the book *A Century of Indiana Glass* has recently written an extensive article about the Indiana Glass Hen.  In this article, he stated that after reviewing hundreds of pages of company catalogs, ads, and other source material, he found no proof that Indiana Glass Company made the Cobalt Blue Hen.  He speculated that it was a reproduction made overseas, possibly somewhere in Asia.

**Who made (or who sold) the Cobalt Blue Indiana Glass Hen**

I've spent countless hours trying to solve this mystery.  I've been able to verify that the Indiana Glass Resting Cat Dish was reproduced overseas in Cobalt Blue, and was sold in America.. distributed by AA Importing, and also found it in a catalog from Miles Kimball [here, pg. 7](https://media.mileskimball.com/images/mk_glassmailer.pdf)

The Indiana Glass Cat in Cobalt Blue is known among collectors to have had a ""Made in Taiwan"" sticker on the bottom.  Indiana Glass never made this item in Cobalt Blue.

The Cobalt Blue Indiana Hen is scarce, but it's not one-of-kind.  I know of around 10 or so people on different collectors groups who have one.  They've been found in the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and in Ontario, Canada.

I'm thinking they must've been sold at retail on store shelves at some point, or probably more likely, were featured in a mail order catalog.  Maybe it was even Miles Kimball, the same catalog that is today selling the Indiana Cat.  Maybe it could be in one of probably dozens of other catalogs over the years that would sell cheap trinkets.

**When did it enter the market?**

Shirley Smith's book says either 1920s or 1980s.  I'm aware of conversations about it on ebay's glass chat forum from the early 2000s (source: wayback machine)  1920s is an impossibility because the first Indiana Hen was made in 1935, and the striated nest that Cobalt appears in is from the 70s and later.  So 1980s seems more likely, but it may've appeared as late as the 90s or early 2000s.

So.. that's it.  There has to be some remnant of a catalog, or sales order, or receipt, or something.  Someone bought these from the primary market, somewhere, at some time.  Everyone I know who has one, says they bought it on the secondary market (thrift stores, estate sales, etc.)  If someone did buy it from the primary market, they're staying silent about it--possibly because the truth is it was made overseas and not by Indiana Glass.  The question is, how to find it?  Where to search, where to look?

I reached out to Miles Kimball with no reply, I reached out to the Sears Historic Society thinking it may've been in an old K-Mart Catalog, but no reply there either.

428,majowa2000,1640698821,"Back in February and March, I made a couple of videos detailing 19 John and Jane Doe cases that I believed would be solved by the DNA Doe Project this year. Since then, 5 of these cases have been publicly announced as solved (seems like I may have been a little optimistic!), while multiple cases outside of those predictions have been solved too. But as it turns out, some of these cases were actually solved long before I made those videos - Pulaski County Jane Doe, for example, was actually identified way back in 2019! For various reasons, some law enforcement agencies choose not to make these identifications public for months, or even years, so in 2022 it'll be worth bearing in mind that some of the announced solves were actually identified a very long time ago.

I'll keep posting updates about these cases as we enter 2022, where I hope that we'll see even more of these cases solved and the Does in question reunited with their names at long last. By an odd twist of fate, I'm now working for the DNA Doe Project, so I won't be able to make any predictions for 2022, but I'll still be closely tracking what happens to the 2021 cases (one of which I'm now working on!).

&amp;#x200B;

Below are the summaries for the solved DDP cases announced this year, along with links to YouTube videos about them. I've also included links to the original prediction posts and videos for anyone interested:

**Charlene Doe**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CytyQGAUAo**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CytyQGAUAo)

Case number 7 was Charlene Doe, a woman who was found murdered in Newton County, Indiana in 1988, and whose homicide remains unsolved to this day.

The Newton County Coroner’s Office has revealed that the woman had been identified as Jenifer Noreen Denton, who was 24 years old when she went missing. She had a 1 year old daughter at the time of her disappearance, and although her sister tried to file a missing person’s report back in 1988, the local police department refused on the grounds that Jenifer was an adult.

Though investigators had initially believed that Charlene Doe might be from Chicago, she was actually from the city of Joliet, Illinois, around 60 miles northwest of the area her body was found in. With her remains having been buried in a cemetery near the site where her body was found, she hasn’t been far from her hometown for the last 33 years, and now Jenifer’s family finally know what happened to her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kern County Jane Doe (1980)**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h39MFoTO9JA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h39MFoTO9JA)

Case #4 was Kern County Jane Doe, a woman whose body was found in Delano, California in 1980, after she was murdered by Wilson Chouest.

It's been announced that, after more than 40 years, Kern County Jane Doe has been identified as Shirley Ann Soosay. The DNA Doe Project’s belief that she was of indigenous Canadian ancestry turned out to be correct, as Soosay was originally from the community of Maskwacis in Alberta, Canada. The identification also solves the mystery of the ‘Shirley’ tattoo on the victim’s body – it turned out to be a tattoo of her own name.

It’s worth noting that this is believed to be the first time that a Doe from an indigenous background has ever been identified using forensic genealogy. The reasons for this are varied and complex, but the main issue is the under-representation of people of indigenous descent in the GEDmatch and FTDNA databases. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pulaski County Jane Doe**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D5aiaa3G5k&amp;t=0s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D5aiaa3G5k&amp;t=4s)

Case #5 was Pulaski County Jane Doe, a woman who was found murdered in Missouri in 1981, and whose killer has never been identified.

On the 40th anniversary of her body being found, it was announced that Pulaski County Jane Doe had been identified as Karen Kaye Knippers. Though DDP volunteers identified Knippers back in December 2019, this identification was not officially confirmed until recently when a DNA sample from a brother in Virginia was compared to her sample in CODIS.

Thanks to isotope testing, investigators had long believed that Pulaski County Jane Doe was originally from the Southeast of the United States, and this belief turned out to be correct – Knippers was originally from Florida. Despite this, she was living in Missouri at the time of her disappearance, and was last seen alive in St. Louis, around 130 miles east of the place where her body was discovered.

Knippers was 32 years old at the time of her murder, which is consistent with the predicted age range given after her body was found, but although it was initially thought that she might be of Native American or Hispanic descent, DNA testing showed that she was actually a European American.

Although the killer of Karen Knippers has not yet been caught, it is hoped that her identification will open up new lines of enquiry in the investigation into her murder.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marion County John Doe**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjWCHxDaqNY&amp;t=0s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjWCHxDaqNY&amp;t=0s)

Case #8 was Marion County John Doe, a man who was found murdered in Ohio in 1989 and whose homicide remains unsolved to this day.

It's been revealed that the DNA Doe Project has identified Marion County John Doe as John C. Kraicinski, who was 33 years old at the time of his death. Born on 22 September 1955, Kraicinski had previously been a resident of Galion, Ohio and went to visit his father there one day in July 1989. Upon leaving his father’s house, he was never seen again, and his family remained unaware of what had happened to him for over 30 years.

Unbeknownst to them, the body of a man had been found in a creek later that month, just 15 or so miles southwest of Galion. Kraicinski was known to have suffered from mental illness in the past, and had gone missing before only to get back in touch with his family months later, so they assumed that the same was true with this disappearance, with no one making the connection between the missing man and the body in the creek.

Meanwhile, investigators nicknamed the unidentified man ‘Luther’ as they set out to try and identify the remains. But as the decades passed, Luther remained nameless, leading detectives to turn to the DNA Doe Project in 2019 in an attempt to finally identify the mystery man. After the DNA Doe Project started working on the case, they quickly noticed that the man had a substantial amount of Eastern European ancestry, which proved to be a vital clue in solving the case. This lead allowed them to narrow in on John Kraicinski’s family before leading them to the man himself who, despite having never been formally reported missing, seemed to disappear from public records after 1989.

**Hudson John Doe**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooIxT6WnHXg&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooIxT6WnHXg&amp;t=1s)

Case #19 was Hudson John Doe, a man whose body was found in Ohio in 2019 and who was believed to have died at least 50 years prior to this discovery. 

Last month, it was revealed that the DNA Doe Project had identified this man as Richard Bunce, who was about 59 years old at the time of his death. Incredibly, Bunce had been born in New York State in 1793, and had died well over 150 years ago, around the year 1852.

When excavators discovered his body in a pine box back in 2019, reports emerged that people had been buried on the property in the mid-1800s. These rumours turned out to be true, as Bunce had previously lived on that land in the years before his death, with the 1850 census listing him as living there alongside his wife and their many children.

This was discovered after the DNA Doe Project took on the case, uploading the then unknown man’s DNA profile to GEDmatch. They found that he shared a substantial amount of DNA with one of his matches, and the match in question turned out to be Bunce’s great great great granddaughter. This is currently believed to be the oldest Doe case ever solved using investigative genetic genealogy, which proves that the technique is suitable for identifying people who died many decades, or even centuries, ago.

429,logicx24,1640696326,"The evening of February 24th, 1976 was like any other for Michelle Mitchell. The 19 year-old University of Nevada nursing student had spent the day in class, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, she was running a habitual errand—dropping a container of orange juice off to her father at a nearby bowling alley—before heading home. 

Just past 6 PM, Michelle was driving her Volkswagen Beetle east on 9th street, on the southern end of campus, when, as she passed Evans avenue, her engine seized and shut down, causing her car to roll impotently through the intersection. She used the car's accrued momentum to coast to the side of the road, and with the help of a passerby, pushed it into a nearby parking lot. 
Michelle then crossed the street to the university campus, walked into a phone booth, and called her mother, Barbara, to ask for a ride home.

When Barbara Mitchell arrived half an hour later, however, Michelle was nowhere to be seen. Barbara performed a cursory search of the area and found Michelle's Beetle, sitting in the parking lot Michelle had described, but couldn't find Michelle. With rising anxiety, she hurried back to the phone booth and called her husband and the police.

Barbara, her husband Edwin, and the police together spent hours combing over the entire campus and its surrounding neighborhoods searching for Michelle, but to no avail. The police brought a sniffer dog along, but an attempt to have it follow Michelle's scent from the phone booth led nowhere. As night officially set in, the police began to transition Michelle's disappearance into a larger missing-person investigation, with another search planned in the coming week.

Later that night, an elderly couple living at 333 E 9th Street, pulled into their driveway and triggered their garage door. As they watched the door open, their car's headlights began to illuminate the garage's interior, and they saw something unexpected: a human body. The startled couple rushed inside to investigate, and found the body of a partially-clothed woman, lying prostrate in a pool of drying blood, her hands bound behind her back with twine. Police were called, and as they turned the body over, they recognized the woman immediately. It was Michelle Mitchell.

The only major wound on Michelle’s body was a deep laceration across her neck, which was the source of the drying blood. She didn’t have any defensive wounds, which meant she may have been taken by surprise by her attacker, and the state of her body indicated she had been left in the garage for at least a few hours. This implied she had been murdered shortly after her car broke down on 9th street. Notably, an unknown cigarette butt was lifted from the scene, close to Michelle’s body, as were two shoe prints—about a man’s size 9 or 9.5—left in the dust of the garage. The murder weapon, however, was missing, as were Michelle’s car keys.

Witness sightings arrived quickly after the murder was publicized. Two witnesses reported that as a woman matching Michelle’s description walked towards the lot where she’d left her car, a man emerged and put his arms around her. Several others stated that they’d seen a man running away from the scene around the time the murder was thought to have occurred. Fraternity brothers at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house, which was a block from the murder scene on Evan’s Avenue, said they saw a man “walking away from the neighborhood in a hurry.” And most dramatically, a woman driving down 9th street said she almost hit a man who’d sprinted in front of her car. The woman said he had blood on him, and that was he holding one of his hands beneath his jacket.

With the multitude of information that arose in the first few weeks of the investigation, both police and Michelle’s family were optimistic the killer would be found quickly. But after the initial flurry of activity, the investigation ground to a halt. No other credible sightings of the unknown man were reported, nor were the sightings ever linked to a getaway vehicle. And as the years passed, the case went silent and then dormant. Michelle’s murder dropped off the back page of the *Sagebrush*, and the specter of her death receded from collective memory.

Cathy Woods had spent much of her life in psychiatric institutions. First diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at 12, Cathy’s childhood in Shreveport, Louisiana was troubled, marred by many delusions and psychotic breaks. She left school after fifth-grade, and after spending her teenage years enduring numerous treatments for schizophrenia, she decamped to Reno in 1969. In February 1976, Woods was the manager of a topless bar in downtown Reno, close to the university campus. She was working on February 24th.

Shortly after, however, Woods’ mental illness began to worsen again, and in early 1977 she moved back to Shreveport to be near family. In February of 1979, as her mental health deteriorated further, Woods was involuntarily committed to the Louisiana State University (LSU) Medical Center. 

Schizophrenia, which Woods suffered from, is a disorder that weaken patients’ abilities  to distinguish reality from delusion. Sufferers often experience hallucinations—typically, voices—and succumb to bouts of paranoia. Woods, in her plethora of hospital stays, was known to exhibit extreme paranoia, leading her to become convinced of many elaborate conspiracy theories. Her current stay was no different. Woods’ counselors noted that she’d claimed to be an FBI agent, that her mother was poisoning her, and fatefully, on the third day of her stay, that she’d “killed a girl named Michelle in Reno.”

Woods’ counselor, despite knowing about her lengthy history of false statements, decided to notify the police. The Shreveport police department called Reno, which, jubilant at this potential break in the case, sent a detective to the Louisiana to interview Woods. After the first interview, two more detectives flew down from Reno and interviewed Woods again, while Shreveport police obtained a warrant to search Woods’ mother’s house.

After two interviews, police came away with a confession which stated that Woods had led Michelle into the garage on 9th street after offering to fix her car, on the pretext of getting some tools. Woods then made a sexual proposal to Michelle, and when Michelle rebuffed her, Woods slashed Michelle’s throat.

But there were many irregularities with this confession. For one, the interviews were not recorded and the confession was never signed, so the veracity of the entire statement rested on the trustworthiness of the attendant officers. For another, Woods was never able to satisfactorily answer what she’d done with the murder weapon.

Moreover, even in the detectives’ written statement, Woods reported a number of incorrect details. Her description of Michelle’s car described it being a different model and having a different color, and her description of the knot used to bind Michelle was quite different. Additionally, counselors testified that before her interview, Woods had not responded to psychiatric medication and was unable to express her thoughts in a linear manner. Based on what transcripts remain of those interviews, then, it seems like police repeatedly asked Woods questions until she gave them the answers they wanted, slowly feeding her information until she regurgitated parts of it amongst what was a likely a long, incoherent ramble.

In 1980, Cathy Woods was extradited to Nevada, where she stood trial for the murder of Michelle Mitchell. The prosecution had no physical evidence, and Woods didn’t match any of the eyewitness accounts of a suspicious man fleeing down 9th street. Nor did they have a signed confession. But despite it all, Cathy Woods was sentenced to life in prison without parole, a result that was confirmed after a retrial in 1985. Two different juries rejected significant exonerating evidence because they believed there were no mitigating circumstances that would cause an innocent person to confess to a crime they did not commit.

For the next three decades, Woods would languish in prison, relapsing multiple times into bouts of psychosis and delusion. She would spend her lucid years loudly proclaiming her innocence, but her rudimentary education and struggles with writing prevented her from effectively petitioning the authorities. The few letters she was able to write fell on deaf ears. Finally, in early 2013, with the help of another inmate, Cathy wrote a letter to the Rocky Mountain Innocence Project, asking for a DNA test of the cigarette butt found at the scene. In August of 2013, the test was carried out.

The test finally vindicated Cathy Woods and her years of resistance. The DNA profile on the cigarette indicated the suspect was a caucasian male, similar to the original witness sightings. And when the DNA was uploaded to the FBI’s national database, investigators found a more surprising result. The DNA matched evidence left at the scenes of two other 1976 unsolved cases in California: the murders of Veronica Cascio and Paula Baxter, victims in the so-called Gypsy Hill Killings.

---

On January 7th, 1976, eighteen year-old Veronica Ann Cascio was waiting at a bus stop on Bradford Way and Fairway Drive in Pacifica, a beachside town in San Mateo County, California. The Skyline College student was heading to campus for the day, and as she was attending a friend’s birthday party that evening, her family wasn’t worried when she didn’t come home that night. The next day, a high school student walking home for lunch spotted Veronica’s body lying face down in a creek at Sharp Park Golf Course, less than a quarter mile from where she was last seen alive. She had been stabbed over thirty times, and an autopsy revealed she’d been sexually assaulted. 

Two weeks later, on January 24th, Tanya Blackwell, a fourteen year old high school student in Pacifica, left her home on Heathcliff drive to walk to a 7-11 a mile away. She never returned, and after a few hours of fruitless searching, her parents reported her missing. No other evidence of Tanya was found, however, and she remained a missing person for six months.  Finally, on June 6th, her body was discovered off of Gypsy Hill Road in Pacifica, a few miles from her home. Like Veronica, Tanya had been stabbed over 20 times, and her body was found less than a mile from where Veronica’s was. The similarity in M.O, location, and ages of the victims led police to immediately link the cases, and the distinctive name of the street she was found on gave the murders their popular moniker: the Gypsy Hill Killings.

On February 4th, eight days after Tanya’s disappearance, seventeen year old Paula Louise Baxter went missing after leaving Capuchino high school in San Bruno, a few miles east of Pacifica. The next morning, her station wagon was found on a nearby residential street, with its wheels, undercarriage, and driver’s seat spattered with blood. Her body was found next to a Mormon Church less than a block from the high school. Baxter had been sexually assaulted, stabbed four times, and had her head bashed in with a concrete block. Since hers was the second body found, the obvious similarities to the Cascio case made police broaden their search to a serial offender.

The murderer then temporarily went quiet in the Bay Area, but the DNA link indicated that he went to Reno around February 24th to kill Michelle Mitchell. About two weeks after that, on March 15th, Carol Lee Booth went missing in South San Francisco. She was walking home from a bus stop at El Camino Real and Arroyo Drive, taking a shortcut through (what used to be) a heavily wooded area by the Kaiser hospital, when she was dragged into the bushes and murdered. Her body was found two months later in a shallow grave on Grand Avenue, near Colma Creek. She had also been stabbed repeatedly. The level of decomposition, however, made it impossible to determine if she had been sexually assaulted.

The final murder officially connected to the Gypsy Hill killings was that of Denise Lampe on April 1st. Denise was last seen walking towards her car in the Serramonte Shopping Center in Daly City, intending to meet a friend later that evening. She never made it, however, and at 10 PM that night, a mall security guard came upon her body, slumped over the front seat of her car. 

Like the other murdered women, Lampe had also been stabbed to death, and her murder occurred within the same Daly City-South San Francisco-Pacifica triangle that the killer was familiar with. Unlike the other women, however, Lampe was not sexually assaulted, and her murder occurred in a crowded shopping center, not on a quiet residential street. These differences made the connection to the Gypsy Hill murders more tenuous, and while police investigated the killing as part of a serial offense, many observers believed it may be unrelated. 

There is one more murder often included as part of the Gypsy Hill Killings: the March 17th, 1976 killing of Idell M. Friedman (just two days after Carol Booth’s murder). Friedman was killed in her home on 116 Fairmount Street in the Glen Park neighborhood of San Francisco. In Friedman’s case, however, the connection is even more tenuous. Friedman was the only victim killed in her home, unlike most of the others, who were abducted while outside. She was partially strangled with a lamp cord before being stabbed just once, which again differs from the previous victims’ multitude of stab wounds. Friedman was also sexually assaulted, but her home had been ransacked, indicating the crime may have been motivated by robbery. 

Regardless, after the murder of Denise Lampe, the killer went entirely silent in the San Francisco Bay Area and Reno, with no other murders bearing his imprint surfacing. Police theorized he either moved elsewhere or was imprisoned on unrelated charges. And as the murders stopped, so too did the investigation. All of the murders had few witnesses and little useable physical evidence. There weren’t any fingerprints left behind anywhere, and while there was unknown DNA found, the technology available in 1976 wasn’t able to analyze it. A massive investigation, one of the largest in San Mateo history, was downsized to just a few detectives, and then to none. DNA samples for the Veronica Cascio, Paula Baxter, Denise Lampe, and Idell Friedman cases were stored for posterity, but for Carol Booth and Tanya Blackwell, whose bodies weren’t discovered until months after their murders, no viable samples existed.

In 2013, the cases were all reopened after the connection to Michelle Mitchell was discovered. But detectives still weren’t optimistic about a resolution. It had been almost four decades since the murders. The few witnesses’ memories had faded, many of the victims’ families had passed away, and many of the crime scenes had been developed over. In the early months of 2014, the case looked set to go cold again. 

But then, police got lucky.

---

In late 2014, a prisoner serving a life sentence in a Nevada prison was paroled, leading to his immediate extradition to Oregon to serve a separate fifteen year sentence. In Oregon, it was mandatory for all inmates in state prisons to register their DNA with national authorities, but when the prisoner had been admitted to the Nevada prison, no such law existed. And so, when the prisoner’s DNA was uploaded to the national database, almost twenty-five years after he first entered the correctional system, there was an unexpected result. The prisoner’s DNA matched semen found on Veronica Cascio and Paula Baxter’s bodies, and to the cigarette butt left by Michelle Mitchell’s body. The deeply incriminating find proved one thing beyond doubt: Rodney Lynn Halbower was the Gypsy Hill Murderer.

Rodney Halbower was a lifelong criminal. By his own account, his first arrest was at age nine, when he smashed all the windows of a house in his hometown of Muskegon, Michigan. His first stint in juvenile prison came in 1963, when, aged fifteen, he stole a car and crashed it. He was released on parole, but was quickly rearrested after an attempted robbery. Before he could be sentenced, however, he escaped. He was recaptured within weeks and sentenced to five years in prison.

This pattern—arrest, escape, rearrest—would be the recurring cycle of Halbower’s life. In 1970 he was released from prison, but was arrested again shortly after for theft. He was given a four year term, but escaped, and while on the run, he fathered his only child. Halbower was then again captured, and after completing his sentence, he was released in 1975. After his release, he moved from Michigan to Nevada, settling in downtown Reno. In December of 1975, he raped and assaulted a blackjack dealer in Reno. The victim survived and identified Halbower, who was again arrested but was released on bail. 

Halbower would remain at large until May of 1976, when he was convicted for the rape and assault and sentenced to life in prison. It was in this five month window that Halbower went on his killing spree, murdering, at the very least, Veronica Cascio, Paula Baxter, and Michelle Mitchell.

In June 1977, Halbower escaped from prison again, and though he made the FBI’s “Most Wanted” list, he managed to elude capture until July, where he was found in Muskegon attempting to kidnap his daughter. Halbower was returned to prison, where he stayed until he successfully escaped again in December. He was again recaptured and remained in prison for another eight years.

In 1986, Halbower escaped his maximum-security prison in Nevada, and this time, he stole a car and drove to Oregon. In Jackson, Oregon, he raped and attempted to murder a woman. The victim again survived the attack, and quickly identified Halbower as her attacker. In March 1987, Halbower was sentenced to 15 years-to-life in Oregon. He was then extradited back to Nevada to complete his original sentence, and when he was paroled in 2013, he was returned to Oregon. This transfer led to his DNA being taken, and it was the reason investigators were able to trace him back to the Gypsy Hill Killings. If Halbower had never escaped prison in 1986, the murders probably would have remained unsolved.

Halbower did not, however, match DNA found on Denise Lampe’s body, proving definitively that her murder was not linked to the Gypsy Hill Killings. Instead, in 2017, a blood stain on Lampe’s jacket was matched to Leon Melvin Seymour, an inmate at Coalinga State Hospital, and, like Halbower, a convicted sex offender who had spent long stints in prison. Halbower also did not match DNA left on Idell Friedman’s body, whose murder remains unsolved. The confirmation that both Denise Lampe and Idell Friedman were not victims of the Gypsy Hill Killer, despite the striking temporal proximity of their deaths, should be a cautionary tale for those searching for patterns across potentially unrelated deaths.

In September 2018, a jury in San Mateo deliberated for just one hour and fifteen minutes before finding Rodney Halbower guilty of the murders of Veronica Cascio and Paula Baxter. The bulwark of the prosecution’s case was the DNA, which the district attorney called “incontrovertible.” Halbower was sentenced to two life sentences, one for each murder. Currently, he is awaiting extradition to Nevada to stand trial for the murder of Michelle Mitchell. 

The murders of Tanya Blackwell, Carol Booth, and Idell Friedman remain unsolved. Police believe Blackwell and Booth were also Halbower’s victims, but he has denied any involvement, and the lack of DNA makes it impossible to lay charges. These murders will remain officially unsolved, but at least their families will have some closure. 

Idell Friedman’s case, on the other hand, has not progressed since 1976. The police have no suspects, no motives, and no witness sightings, leaving the case in a decades-long purgatory. Friedman’s death in 1976 overlapped with the California serial killer boom, leading many online sleuths to try to link her case to the Zodiac Killer and the Golden State Killer. Most likely, however, her death is entirely unrelated to these serial offenders, and it will not be resolved unless there’s a serendipitous DNA match.

The arc of Cathy Woods’ life did eventually bend towards justice, but it took an excruciatingly long time. From her initial imprisonment in 1980 to her final release in February of 2015, Woods spent thirty-five years in prison—the longest sentence a wrongfully convicted woman has served. She entered prison as a troubled but optimistic twenty-five year old, recovering from a mental relapse, but left as a grizzled senior citizen, bearing the loss of her middle age in the creases lining her brow.

After her release, she first moved to southern California to stay with family, before making a trip to Shreveport to see her 92-year-old mother for the first time in three decades. She then moved to an assisted living facility in Washington, where, in August of 2021, aged just 72, she passed away. 

Woods’ passing is a tragic coda to the story of the Gypsy Hill Killings, and the vapidity of her ordeal highlights the shortcomings of our justice system. A jury of one’s peers is still colored by the prejudices of those peers, by the stereotypes and implicit biases that govern their judgement. Cathy Woods was convicted because she was mentally ill in an era that considered psychosis a personal fault, and confessed to lesbianism in an era that viewed homosexuality as a deathly sin. The miscarriage of justice that followed is a symptom of that inherent flaw.

Years later, when asked why Cathy confessed to crime she did not commit, her lawyer said, “I'm told it was a product of wanting to get a private room. She was being told she wasn't sufficiently dangerous to qualify, and within a short period she was claiming she had killed a woman in Reno.”

430,Ok-Explorer496,1640661093,"I'm sorry if I'm doing something wrong. This is my first experience in creating a post. I recently got acquainted with the NFT technology at a basic level and thought that Cicada could use this technology to authenticate their messages + this could solve their problem with the PGP key, since I heard that it was compromised or stolen (sorry if I wrote some nonsense, I'm doing cryptography and studying the mysteries of Cicada 3301 as a hobby and haven't delved deep enough yet).

At some point, I thought, what if Cicada has already posted its riddles or messages on one of the NFT platforms. I started googling NFT marketplace. I started with the most famous Binance, Rarible, OpenSea... Unfortunately, the search for the phrase Cicada 3301 on these sites did not lead to anything useful, only to a bunch of repeating pictures from the first riddle and to the people who collected it and I gave up.

After a while, I thought, what if I was looking for the wrong thing. Perhaps Cicada saw a huge number of users with different variations of Cicada logins and decided to use something that could highlight their account. I decided that their nickname should be some kind of cipher, but the decryption should also lie on the surface, because it is almost impossible to guess a complex cipher without some introductory words.

I started playing with the Cicada3301 login. One of the first ciphers that cicada used was the Caesar cipher. Maybe it's stupid, but the first thing that occurred to me was to encrypt Cicada with this cipher with an offset of 3301. It turned out: Bhbzcz. I started looking for accounts with this nickname on the same NFT sites. Success! There is a strange account on Rarible with one item ""Second"". [https://rarible.com/bhbzcz](https://rarible.com/bhbzcz) Assuming that the First is an account avatar, I downloaded it and immediately got into the hex editor.

Failure again. There was nothing encrypted in the picture. But I paid attention to its size, most likely Rarible deliberately compresses the avatar to the size it needs, as many other sites do. Therefore, the encrypted message could be lost during compression. My task was to find the original image. (I note that the avatar itself is drawn in pencil, and I have not seen anything like this before in the Cicada 3301 riddles). I used Google image search, but it didn't lead me to the original.

After some more time, I noticed that there are two types of display of the user's avatar on the site, two different sizes. After opening the links to both options, I noticed that they both have the same ID. You only need to choose the right URL for the original image format.

Equal ID: QmRJY2vg4VwmDKGrcZquPmQHGPn6Qd98sGgT3RvvsW9JHd

The first 30 minutes of selecting the URL did not lead to anything, and I gave up this idea.

I decided to try a different approach and registered my account on Rarible to see if the account owner could get a link to the original image of his avatar, and bingo, it worked. It turns out that the sources locate on a completely different domain ([https://ipfs.rarible.com/ipfs/](https://ipfs.rarible.com/ipfs/)), but their ID matches.

I got the source of the avatar and started to disassemble it in the hex editor, at the very end I found this message:

This massacre occurred on February 10, 1990 where Seven people were shot, four fatally wounded by two Unidentified robbers at the La Crucs bowling alley at 1201 East Amador Avenue. The armed Gunmen shot the Victims in an office then had set fire to a desk in the room and left the scene.

Shooting 

On the Morning of February, 10, 1990 It was a regular day. The manger  of the Bowling alley 34 year old  Stephanie  C Senac was at her office  preparing to open the Business with her 12 year old daughter Melissa Repass and her 13 year old friend Amy Houser, Who were planning to supervise the alley\`s day care. The alley\`s cook  Ida Holguin  was in the kitchen when two armed men entered the building through a unlocked door. One of the men pulled up a 22 Caliber pistol on  Holguin and ordered her into Senac\`s office while Her and Repass, Houser were held Gun point by a another gunmen. They ordered the women  and children to lie down while taking  

approximately $4,000 to $5,000 from the bowling alley's safe. Soon after, Steve Teran, the alley's 26-year-old pin mechanic, entered. As Teran had been unable to find a babysitter for his two daughters—two-year-old Valerie Teran and six-year-old Paula Holguin (no relation to Ida)—he intended to drop them off at the alley's day care.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-FoxNews-2) Not seeing anyone in the alley, Teran entered Senac's office and stumbled onto the crime scene. The gunmen then shot all seven victims multiple times at point-blank range.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-CNN-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-FoxNews-2) They then set the office on fire by igniting some papers before leaving the alley.

The bowling alley fire was reported at 8:33 am. Officers responding to the call discovered that Amy Houser, Paula Holguin, and Steven Teran had died at the scene. Valerie Teran was rushed to a hospital, but declared dead on arrival.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-3) Repass, despite being shot five times, called [9-1-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1) on the office phone, allowing emergency services to respond immediately and saving her life along with her mother's and Ida Holguin's.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-4) However, Senac died in 1999 due to complications from her injuries.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces_bowling_alley_massacre#cite_note-lcsun-5)

According to aforementioned article:

“Podraza told Dateline in an email last week that the materials included the apartment building surveillance video, the declarations of two building employees, and the videotaped depositions of Drs. Gulino, Osbourne and Emery of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office. It was Dr. Emery, a pathologist in the Medical Examiner’s Office in 2019 trained in neuropathology, who previously testified that a specimen of Ellen’s cervical spine retained from the original autopsy contained one of Ellen’s stab wounds.

“According to Dr. Emery, the preserved wound Emery examined in 2019 was administered when Ellen had no pulse – she was already dead,” Podraza said.

He went on to explain that “this wound was not the last stab wound Ellen sustained because a knife was found embedded in Ellen’s chest when emergency personnel arrived on the scene.”

“We remain dumbfounded about how a person could self-inflict at least two separate stab wounds when dead,” he added.”

i found this phone call a few years ago, and something about it always made me think about it again from time to time. probably because it is really chilling, but also because of the fact that i just don’t know where the hell the source of it is. it could be fake honestly, but i’m not sure.

it involves a woman named sharon who’s hiding inside her home with her baby. man tries to break into her house, so she calls 911, frantic and clearly panicking. soon enough, he breaks in, and she screams to him, “i have the police on the phone!” before the screams become her pleading, “why are you here? why? why?” she screams, the phone hangs up, and that’s it.

i’ve heard people say she got murdered, others say she got raped, but i’ve been trying to do some digging as to what happened, and i can’t find anything. part of me thinks it’s probably fake because of the lack of source, but i’m not sure. if it’s real, i hope she’s alright! :(

439,TheBonesOfAutumn,1640623598,"On the morning of June 29th, 1989, government employees at The Wayne Township Trustees in Fort Wayne, Indiana made several attempts to contact their fellow coworker, 31-year-old Dawn (Maxwell) Cotton, when she failed to show up for work that day. Dawn was employed at the offices as a typist/clerk, and was known as being extremely punctual. So when coworkers' attempts to reach Dawn by phone failed, they decided to go to her apartment to check on her. 

Dawn lived alone on the first floor of a modest, 1-bedroom, duplex style apartment located at 1319 West Jefferson Street in Fort Wayne. After knocking and receiving no answer, Dawn’s coworkers entered the apartment only to be met with a nightmarish scene; Dawn’s lifeless body lay sprawled across her bed, riddled with stab wounds. 

An autopsy would determine that Dawn had been stabbed more than 30 times in the chest, her heart had been punctured, and her throat had been slit. The coroner found no evidence of defensive wounds on Dawn’s body, leading him to believe she was most likely attacked while asleep. It was also concluded Dawn had not been sexually assaulted. Her ultimate cause of death was listed as blood loss. 

No evidence was found in Dawn’s home that would indicate it had been burglarized. Aside from the gruesome scene in her bedroom, Dawn’s apartment seemed to be completely untouched, nothing appeared to be missing, and there were no signs of forced entry into the home. The weapon used to murder Dawn, was not located. 

Investigators began by questioning neighbors. Unfortunately, aside from several reports of seeing “strangers” in the area in previous days, no one reported seeing or hearing anything suspicious around the time of Dawn’s murder. Dawn’s coworkers were of little assistance either, stating they had no idea why anyone would want to hurt her. After interviews with Dawn’s family and friends produced no leads, law enforcement turned to Crime Stoppers in the hopes someone would come forward with information. Sadly, they never received a single tip. 

Dawn had been married once to a man named Anthony Cotton, however the pair had divorced several years prior and had no ongoing relationship of any kind. Anthony was questioned, but was quickly ruled out as a suspect. 

With little evidence, no motive, and no suspects, Dawn’s case quickly went cold. However, in what some would consider nothing more than a bizarre coincidence, less than a year after Dawn’s murder a second employee of The Wayne Township Trustees would be brutally stabbed to death. 

On April 27th, 1990, 65-year-old Dorothy Klug was found stabbed to death in her home after her coworkers reported that she had failed to come into work that day. Like Dawn, Dorothy had been stabbed more than 30 times. 

However, unlike Dawn’s case, an arrest came almost immediately. 33-year-old Latanya Robinson, a coworker of Dorothy’s at The Wayne Township Trustees, was arrested the same day after she was witnessed driving Dorothy’s vehicle. 

It was learned that Latanya and a male friend had borrowed money from Dorothy earlier in the evening to purchase drugs with. After using the money and getting high, the pair returned to Dorothy’s home around 3am to borrow more. According to the male friend, he waited in the car for a while but grew impatient. When he approached the home, he heard a woman scream and saw Latanya standing over Dorothy with a pair of scissors, covered in blood through a window. 

Latanya admitted killing Dorothy in a drug fueled rage when Dorothy refused to give her more money after learning she had used the previous money for drugs. She was found guilty of felony murder and two counts of robbery. However, while investigators commented on the similarities of the two slayings, they were never proven to be related. 

That same year, James Winters, yet another member of The Wayne Township Trustees, would be arrested on charges of theft, mismanagement of funds, and official misconduct. James, along with eight other township employees were accused of participating in a kickback scheme involving funds from the towns “poor-relief funds.” 

Rumors swirled that Dawn’s murder was the result of her discovering the misuse of funds, however investigators found no evidence indicating that Dawn was aware of any of the illegal activities occurring at her workplace. 

32 years later, Dawn’s case remains unsolved.

440,justiceforlenora,1640609263,"On February 15, 1953 Lenora Seiler was dropped off by her father at the local movie theater in Valley Park, Missouri. When her father came to pick her up later that evening, she was gone. What happened between when Lenora left the theater and her body was found a month later is unclear and still remains a mystery to date.

What is known for sure is the following: Lenora began walking home alone after the movie ended earlier than expected. Her parents recalled hearing a car door slam and a scream from an unknown individual they thought was Lenora near their home sometime that evening. Their fear, like everybody else’s, was that somebody had abducted the quiet, 13-year-old girl. Police, as was the norm of the time, believed her to be a runaway until she failed to return home after several days. The shift then began to focus from her just running away to foul play. Lenora’s community kept their hopes up for a safe return, holding vigils, praying, lighting candles, and searching for the girl. The employer of her father offered a $1,000 reward (equivalent to over $10,000 today).

The town’s hopes were crushed on March 14, 1953 when Lenora’s body was found in the Meramec River. None of Lenora’s clothes or belongings were found with the body and the coroner believed that the body may have been buried in the river but washed away. Popcorn found in her stomach indicated that Lenora likely died within five hours of her disappearance. No signs of assault were found on the body and a definitive cause of death was not able to be determined, but the coroner thought that asphyxiation was likely. Police believed it was a homicide and ruled it as so. Like the town’s hopes, Lenora’s story began to fade with time. Her church’s baptismal fountain was dedicated in honor of her in July of that year.

No leads or tips surfaced in the case until 1958, when a 22-year-old man, named Denver Darrell Morris, confessed to killing Lenora. Police believed his statements to be credible, but his aunt and uncle later told police that he was mentally ill. Morris later recanted his confession to the crime and a lie detector test cleared him of any involvement. Due to the time that has passed, Lenora’s case was closed and it remains unsolved.

Let’s break it down…

*Barney &amp; Betty Hill*

In the December 1974 issue of Astronomy, the then-editors published a lead feature story titled “The Zeta Reticuli Incident.” 

This feature described the so-called Betty and Barney Hill story, in which a New Hampshire couple claimed to have been abducted in 1961 and taken aboard an alien spacecraft. 

Betty Hill famously drew a star map from memory, in 1964, under psychoanalysis. The map supposedly showed the sky as seen from a planet orbiting the star Zeta Reticuli, from which the alien abductors had arrived.

https://astronomy.com/bonus/zeta

*Bob Lazar*

Lazar claims to have been hired in the late 1980s to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial technology at what he described as a secret site called ""S-4"". Lazar alleges that this subsidiary installation is located several kilometers south of the United States Air Force facility popularly known as Area 51.

From Lazar’s appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience:

“There was some paperwork that indicated that this [UFO] was from the Zeta Reticuli star system. How they obtained that, I haven’t the slightest idea. It wasn’t just from the Zeta Reticuli star system, it was what they called ZR3. It was the third planet in that star system. There was no other information about it, other than that’s supposedly where the craft came from.”

I also think an intruder or family friend is responsible for JonBenet Ramsey's death. People say 'why leave her body in the house?' but it's certainly easier than transporting and hiding the body.

Jennifer was last seen walking home from school. She was one block from her family's residence on 15th Street and 109th Avenue in Tampa, Florida on November 15, 1982 at approximately 3:00 p.m. Jennifer asked a friend to watch her as she continued to her house; her friend turned away for a moment and Jennifer disappeared. She has not been seen again. All family members were cleared by authorities of involvement in her disappearance. 

Authorities suspected that Thomas Peter Welnicki, a family friend of Jennifer with an extensive criminal history for charges ranging from theft to drug possession to minor assault, was involved in her case. A photograph of Welnicki is posted with this case summary.

When questioned by police, he claimed to have a psychic vision of Jennifer's abduction and murder. He said she was abducted and strangled by two men. One of them, he said, was in his forties and had a criminal history, and the other was a blond man in his mid-twenties whom Jennifer knew and trusted, and whose conscience troubled him deeply after the child's death. Welnicki himself matches the description of the blond man.

Authorities believe Welnicki's ""vision"" was actually a confession, but he denies this. He failed a polygraph about Jennifer's case, but this may have been because he was taking medication to prevent seizures. Welnicki he has never been charged in connection with Jennifer's case. I haven't been able to locate any viable information on him in many years. 

There have been multiple leads regarding remains located in the area of Jennifer's disappearance. Her family has submitted DNA but none have proven fruitful. In 2012 there was a lead which many of us felt was promising; a young woman reported her suspicion that her neighbor who lived on the same block as Jennifer at the time of her disappearance might be involved. This was a credible report, and Law Enforcement obtained warrants and searched multiple properties, but ultimately it did not produce any hard evidence. 

[Police search Pennsylvania properties for missing Jennifer Marteliz ](https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/pennsylvania-police-search-for-grave-of-girl-who-vanished-from-tampa/1238878/)

She has a large family and community of friends who love her, and have prayed every day for her return. Some of these people have already passed away, never knowing what happened to her.

454,ChicTurker,1640551591,"Just a little over two miles from my house in Little Rock, Arkansas -- and even closer to the house of [Jennings Osborne](https://allears.net/2020/11/22/the-complete-history-of-the-osborne-family-spectacle-of-dancing-lights/), so a ""good"" area of a city that was divided by redlining (leading to houses never getting valued properly/continuing to be devalued in other areas of the city) -- a woman and her dog made a shocking discovery.

A woman's body had been placed behind an abandoned house, apparently hastily covered with construction materials or leftover demolition debris laying around the rear of the home.  She had been shot.  

Her clothing was male-branded, but that could have been more necessity than choice -- and she was dressed for winter, suggesting that whoever killed her did not do it in August.  The status of the remains seem to suggest that as well, though postmortem intervals are difficult to determine.  The only jewelry photographed was a bracelet, clearly weathered in the photos.  She had a discernable gap in her front teeth in death, may have been covered by gums in life enough not to be discernable.

The [initial reconstruction](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/517ufar.html) of her was awful and if her family didn't recognize her from it, I can't blame then.  Her recent reconstructions definitely are more realistic-looking, though her new reconstruction makes her look more like [Minnie Taylor[(https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/9984/details) (a possibility considered by sleuthers but she disappeared in May of 2002 when 70 feels hot, not cold -- and they may have dentals on her that rule out Taylor as a match.  She is not a ruleout on NamUS as of yet, but I believe that the Doe Network PM panel has reviewed this in the past -- if someone wants to submit it to them again, though, the LRPD may be accepting any leads now that they put money into a better reconstruction.

-------

This area is also close to I-40 by distance -- though only a killer familiar with Little Rock (or wanting her found there) would go off of I-40 on I-430 towards Little Rock, take the first exit off it and head towards downtown instead of out of town, then turn down the first seemingly quiet street.  

Anyone knowing Little Rock well enough to know how many churches existed on the northern part of Reservoir Road (2772 seems an input error, 2722 is an address though that had property taxes paid in the past) but already on the Interstate would likely know a better place to dump a body.

There was (and still is) a ""rent by the week"" studio apartment complex on the lower end of Reservoir Road, but that would point to a visitor IMHO, not an on-the-lease resident, being the killer (too close to where records said your home was).  She could have also been a visitor or a guest, though also potentially a leasing resident at any of the apartment complexes in the area -- if she had no close family to report her missing, her landlord could have assumed she abandoned the lease.

However, I DO think she was killed somewhere nearby where she was discovered -- mostly because someone driving far in that area with a body in their car would feel very uncomfortable.  They might have used the freeway just to avoid cops and came from a different area of the city/county through the freeway route I mentioned, figuring they were safer if they were doing the limit, but they would still have to know Little Rock fairly well to know even know where this location was to dump the body there and by that route avoid being on city streets w/ a body in the trunk -- without resorting to just going further down the freeway into a rural part of the state where she may never have been found at all.

(The timeline for this Doe does not match the Samuel Little confessions.)

Save for a single appearance in August 2007, she has been in deep isolation for over 15 years.

Tony Ortega's website, which reports on Scientology through documents, leaks, and interviews with former cult members, is the source for most of this information. Links to sources at the end!!!

**Shelly's Disappearance: A Timeline**

* January 18, 1961: Michele ""Shelly"" Barnett born
* 1970s: as a young teen, Shelly joins the Commodore's Messenger Org (CMO), working closely with L. Ron Hubbard. This Scientology in-group later evolves into the Sea Org.
* 1982: Shelly marries fellow CMO member David Miscavige
* 1986: L. Ron Hubbard dies and David Miscavige assumes control of the cult
* 1990s: the Miscaviges move to the Scientology compound known as ""Int Base"" or ""Gold Base,"" located in the desert in Riverside County, California. Their legal address, however, is one of Scientology's properties on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.
* 1980s-2000s: Shelly acts as an assistant to her husband in his role of leading (aka micro-managing) Scientology. According to some former members, she helped ""audition"" actresses to be Tom Cruise's girlfriend when he was single in the early 2000s.
* circa 2004: Growing more abusive and controlling, David Miscavige creates a place called ""the Hole"" on Int Base, to imprison and punish his staff who displease him. Tensions in the Miscavige marriage; David spends too much time with his ""personal communicator"" Laurisse ""Lou"" Henley-Smith, and Shelly suspects them of an affair. According to Valerie Haney, who was the Miscaviges' assistant and Shelly's personal friend, David and Lou were not in a sexual relationship at that time. 
* summer 2004: at a party in Tom Cruise's honor on Scientology's cruise ship, David and Shelly fight and he denigrates her in public. 
* summer 2005: David Miscavige leaves Int Base to work in Los Angeles, leaving Shelly behind. Normally, they would travel together, so their relationship is apparently hanging by a thread. At one point, Shelly corners Scientology executive Mike Rinder, who had just returned to the base from working with David in LA. She asks him if David was wearing his gold or his platinum wedding ring. Rinder believes this odd question was her way of trying to find out if David was even wearing a ring while they were separated. He tells her he didn't notice. 
* still summer '05: In David's absence, Shelly ""fills in an org board,"" which is Scientology jargon for shifting some people's jobs around. When David returns, he erupts in anger. He goes back to LA, and Shelly follows him desperately in a car. ""She drove down and then she came right back,"" said Valerie Haney.
* maybe one week later: Shelly boxes up some of her and David's stuff and puts it into storage, in preparation for a renovation of their quarters. According to witnesses, both this and the org board thing were tasks that David had been talking about doing for a long time. Perhaps Shelly was trying to get on his good side by taking care of them? If so, it backfired horribly both times.
* one day later: **Shelly is gone.** She is not in ""the Hole,"" as many people think; the Hole is on Int Base, and Shelly is removed from the base altogether. She is believed to be taken to a smaller Scientology compound in the mountains east of Los Angeles (it has a lot of names, but I'll call it Twin Peaks), and to still be there to this day.
* November 2006: Tom Cruise marries Katie Holmes, and David Miscavige is the best man at the wedding, which is a Scientology ceremony. Actress Leah Remini, a Scientologist, is a wedding guest and wonders where Shelly is (David's date for the wedding is his ""communicator,"" Lou). Asking around to other guests, Remini is told by high-ranking executive Tommy Davis, ""You don't have the fucking rank to ask about that."" However, Scientology has strict rules about not stepping out on one's partner, and also has a structure encouraging snitching. Leah Remini writes a ""Knowledge Report"" on the leader of her church for his ""crimes."" In response, she is punished and forced to rescind her reports on Miscavige.
* summer 2007: Shelly Miscavige's father dies, and she makes a brief appearance at his funeral, accompanied at all times by a handler. **Last ever public sighting of Shelly.**
* July-August 2013: Leah Remini manages to extricate herself from the cult. One of her first actions is to file a missing persons report on Shelly Miscavige, who at this point has been out of sight for eight years. She files it with the LAPD because the Miscaviges' legal address is still that building on Hollywood Boulevard. Journalist Tony Ortega breaks down what happened next: August 5- Leah files the report. August 8- Tony breaks the news of what she did on his website. Same day- reporters calling the LAPD for comment on Tony's story are told the missing persons report is ""unfounded."" A detective has allegedly visited Shelly, talked to her, and confirmed she is not missing. Wherever she is, she says she's there voluntarily. Leah Remini never hears back from the LAPD herself.
* December 2016: an anonymous witness in the mountain town of Crestline, the closest town to the ""Twin Peaks"" compound, reports seeing a ""frail"" and disheveled woman accompanied by two male handlers on two occasions in 2015 and early 2016. She believes the woman may have been Shelly Miscavige, then 55.
* also December 2016: Through a records request to the LAPD, Leah Remini seeks specific documents to answer why the case on Shelly Miscavige was closed so quickly, which detectives spoke to her, and why she (Leah) never heard back. All her requests are denied.
* still Dec. 2016: Tony Ortega contacts the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Dept., which provides law enforcement in the area of Crestline and the Scientology base, about the witness sighting. They respond that there's not enough evidence of a crime for them to check it out.
* December 2018: Leah Remini and Mike Rinder air an episode of their TV show ""Scientology and the Aftermath"" about Shelly's disappearance. The Church of Scientology responds: ""Remini is a foaming anti-Scientologist. Mrs. Miscavige has personally and repeatedly told law enforcement that Remini's acts are abusive. Remini is unhinged and Remini and her cohorts should be prosecuted for knowingly filing a false missing person's report.""
* January 18, 2022: On this day, Shelly Miscavige will turn 61 years old. There has been only one confirmed sighting of her since she was 44. Does she know when it's Christmas, or her birthday? She very well may not.

25 years ago today, a six year old child named Jonbenet Ramsey was kidnapped from her bedroom and murdered in her own home. It was Christmas night when a predator took her from her bed and strangled her, leaving a golden cross tangled in the weapon that stole her young life.

The vengeance with which she was murdered reverberated, first through the city of Boulder, and then the world. This senseless act of violence inflicted trauma on an innocent child and everyone else in its orbit. 

Trauma looked different for different people. It looked like hundreds of cameras descending on a local PD, making it impossible for them to do their job. It looked like neighbors mistrusting one another, and being reduced to gossip and suspicion. It looked like victim blaming.

Jonbenet Ramsey didn’t vote to be a headline, a pop star’s Halloween costume, or a beauty vlogger’s arm tattoo. She didn’t elect to live in infamy on street posters next to Marilyn Monroe. **She is not a symbol.** She was a human being. 

If you care about this victim, then sign the petition to tell Boulder you care.

We cannot wait a moment more for the wheels of bureaucracy to catch up with the scales of justice.

- Please **be KIND** when you sign the petition. Our intention is to tell BPD that we support their investigation. Harassing their department will not get us anywhere. Be nice and remember that this group is the only one that can close the case. So tell them why this should be brought to justice.
- **Stay united.** I made the petition simple enough to be signed by people who care about this case, regardless of who they think “did it.” Whether you are “RDI” or “IDI” - please sign this petition and tell the BPD that this victim matters to you.
- **Concerned about privacy?** You can elect to sign this petition privately. Beneath the 'Sign' button you will see the 'Display my name and comment on this petition' option. Unselecting this option will 'hide' your comment and name from the main petition page. 

**To journalists reading this petition:** stop calling this child a beauty queen. I am floored by how many articles written this week still featured pageant footage. She was a six year old that liked to rock climb and was learning violin. Don’t talk to your J-school buds about sexism and then marginalize a murder victim in this way. Do better.

458,A_Wise_Mans_Fear,1640537898,"From December 2019 to January 2020, a series of widely sighted unidentified drones were observed in the skies of Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas. The FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration, and local law enforcement all investigated the sightings but have never determined the origins of the drones…

Now, come along my young padawans, for us to investigate the attack of the drones.

# The Sightings

New Year’s Eve, 2020, Placido Montoya from Fort Morgan, Colorado was on his way to work when he noticed blinking lights in the sky. There had been rumors of mysterious drones, UFOs, floating around the local community but it was a whole different thing to see them in person. Montoya decided to give chase, pushing his truck to 120 mph to try and keep up.

&gt;“They were creepy, really creepy,” Montoya said, “I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s almost as if they were watching us.”

That night, the Morgan County Sheriff’s Office received more than thirty calls from locals reporting more drones. 

At the same time, neighboring Nebraska and Kansas were dealing with their own mysterious sightings. One Nebraska deputy reported seeing 30 to 50 drones in the sky. All reports shared similar details: always multiple drones between 6pm and 10pm, flying in grid formations, with wingspans of up to 6 feet (which is quite large for a drone.)

These sightings caught national attention, with multiple agencies and political figures addressing the issue. Senator of Colorado, Cory Gardner tweeted: 

&gt;“I’ve been in contact with the FAA regarding the heavy drone activity in Eastern Colorado and I’m encouraged that they’ve opened a full investigation to learn the source and purpose of the drones. I will continue to closely monitor the situation.”

# Spoiler alert: They found nothing.

An interagency meeting was held in Colorado involving more than 70 federal, state, and local agencies (including the FBI &amp; the US Air Force.) They had a grand total of zero findings. 

So what’s it all about, Alfie? 

* Here are the most popular theories:
* The drones are military and the military are denying it
* The drones were being used as a tool for mapping (though there are strict rules for flying at night… also they wouldn’t be able to see much at night)
* Criminal activity of either the drug or espionage variety
* Mass hysteria (according to this Vice article)
* Aliens (always)

# Okay guys so… what did we learn?

The answer unfortunately is… not much. However, as more and more sightings and concerns over public safety come into popular discussion, it’s hard to deny that drone technology &amp; UFO’s are going to gain more attention.  

This past December, a provision buried deep in the $770 BILLION (holy moly) defense bill that the US Senate passed calls for the creation of a new agency to investigate reports of UFO sightings. And in June of this year, a government report on UFO sightings said there was no “single explanation” for over 140 incidents reported by military personnel that were deemed a threat to both flight/public safety and a potential threat to national security. 

The Pentagon also quietly announced that it had formed the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group to oversee this new agency… which critics attacked as an attempt to limit transparency on the subject.

All this to say, when the government forms a new legislature to investigate something, and then creates more legislature on top to hide the discoveries of those investigations… there may be more to the story than just “mass hysteria.”

At their home in the Kamisoshigaya neighborhood of Setagaya in the western suburbs of Tokyo on December 31, 2000, the bodies of Mikio Miyazawa, 44, his 41-year-old wife, Yasuko, and their daughters, Niina, 8, and Rei, 6, were discovered by Yasuko’s mother, Haruko, who reported it to the police. Mikio, Yasuko, and Niina had all been stabbed to death, and Rei had been strangled to death as well.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department’s investigation of the crime scene revealed that the family had been murdered on December 30 at approximately 11:30 p.m. (Japan Standard Time) and that the perpetrator had remained in the house for several hours after the murders were committed.

 Miyazawa’s killer got in through an open window in the second-floor bathroom at the rear of the house, which is near to Soshigaya Park, by climbing up a tree and then removing the window screen. Strangling Rei, who was sleeping in his second-floor room, the killer used his bare hands to asphyxiate him.

Mikio went up the first-floor stairs after noticing a disturbance in Rei’s room, fighting and wounding the killer until he was stabbed in the head with a [Sashimi bōchō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimi_b%C5%8Dch%C5%8D) knife. According to a police investigation, a section of the Sashimi knife blade broke off inside Mikio’s head. The killer then stabbed Yasuko and Niina with the broken blade before murdering them with a [*Santoku*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santoku) knife from the Miyazawas’ house.

For between two and ten hours, the killer remained inside the Miyazawas’ home, using the family computer, consuming barley tea, melon, and ice cream from their refrigerator, using their toilet and leaving his feces in it without flushing, treating his injuries with first aid kits and other sanitary products, and napping on a sofa in the second-floor living room.

Mikio Miyazawa’s computer was analyzed. It was revealed that it was connected to the internet at 1:18 a.m. the morning after the killings and again at approximately 10 a.m., around the time Yasuko’s mother Haruko entered the house and discovered the murders. Haruko got suspicious when she was unable to contact her daughter (the killer had disconnected the phone line) and paid a visit to the residence but had no response when she rang the doorbell.

Authorities suspect that the killer had been staying at the house until at least 1:18 a.m., although Haruko also could have accidentally triggered computer use at 10 a.m. when she discovered the crime scene.

 The killer, who maintained a calm demeanor throughout the ordeal, left various personal possessions at the scene of the crime. The culprit does not appear to have been scared of being apprehended or of leaving behind evidence; thus, this does not appear to be an oversight. The suspect changed his clothes and neatly folded his outfight.

The suspect left behind Slazenger sneakers in Korean sizing (likely purchased in Korea), a dark green hip bag — this is similar to a cooler version of a fanny pack; a black handkerchief, a cape, or a scarf, a jacket made of down and winter gloves in black.

Certainly, the culprit was unconcerned about leaving any biological evidence behind. Apart from the bleeding bandages, he flushed the toilet. The stool was examined, and the police were able to determine what he had eaten the night before. It was regarded as a hearty dinner prepared by a mother. Another indication that he may have lived with his mother was a beautifully pressed handkerchief. Additionally, a bloody fingerprint was discovered, but it has never been linked to anyone.

However, police have been unable to identify or catch a suspect despite deducing some highly specific clues about the perpetrator’s identity. Based on an analysis of feces from the killer found in the Miyazawas’ bathroom, it was discovered that the killer had consumed string beans and sesame seeds the day before the murder.

After conducting an investigation, they discovered that the clothes and Sashimi knife left behind by the murderer had been purchased in Kanagawa Prefecture. Moreover, police discovered that just 130 units of the killer’s sweater were manufactured and sold. Still, they have only been able to identify and trace down twelve of those who purchased the sweaters.

Sand particles were also discovered within the hip bag that the culprit had abandoned at the site, which was later proven to have originated in the Nevada desert, more specifically the Edwards Air Force Base area in California.

The DNA and fingerprints of the killer were discovered at the Miyazawas’ home; however, none of them matched the DNA and fingerprints of the killer in the Tokyo police databases, indicating that they do not have a criminal record. It was discovered that the killer’s blood had been obtained during an investigation of the crime scene, which revealed traces of Type A blood that did not belong to the Miyazawa family.

Genetic testing on Type A blood determined that the killer is male and possibly mixed-race, with maternal DNA indicating that the mother is of European descent, possibly from a southern European country near the Mediterranean or the Adriatic Sea, and paternal DNA indicating that the father is of East Asian origin.

Physically, the killer is thought to be approximately 170 centimeters tall and skinny. The police estimate that the killer was born between 1965 and 1985 (15 and 35 at the time of the occurrence) because of the physique needed to enter the Miyazawa house and commit the murders. The wounds of the Miyazawa's show that the killer is likely to be right-handed.

 Despite the fact that the case has been open for two decades, authorities are not given up. The police intend to employ DNA analysis of evidence obtained at the scene, as well as the most up-to-date technologies, to create a picture of the perpetrator’s face and physical appearance.

The horrible killings of the Miyazawa family are still considered to be among the most heinous crimes committed in modern Japan. Will it be solved?

460,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,1640535959,"  Lester Eubanks is wanted for escaping the custody of the Ohio Department of Corrections while on a temporary honor furlough to go Christmas shopping in December of 1973. Eubanks had been serving time for the murder of fourteen-year-old Mary Ellen Deener. On November 14, 1965, Mary Ellen and her younger sister were doing laundry at a laundromat that day when they ran out of change. As she went to another laundromat to get more change, she disappeared.  
Mary Ellen was later found dead nearby. She had been shot twice and beaten with a brick. Eubanks was later arrested for her murder. He confessed that he attempted to sexually assault her, but he killed her when she resisted. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972.  
Eubanks later became an ""honor inmate"" at the Ohio Penitentiary where he was incarcerated. As a result, he earned the privilege of a Christmas shopping trip at the Great Southern Shopping Center in Columbus. On December 7, 1973, he and several other inmates were taken to the shopping center and allowed to shop for several hours by themselves. Although the other inmates returned to their scheduled pick-up location, Eubanks disappeared.  
Eubanks has not been seen since his escape in 1973. However, authorities believe that he went to Michigan afterwards and may have also spent time in Los Angeles, California. At the time, he was 5'11"" and weighed 175 pounds. He has black hair and brown eyes. He has a large scar/burn on his upper right arm. His birthdate is October 31, 1943.

2. The killer did not bring the knife with him; he picked it up at the house. The knife was unsuitable for the purpose; it was a thin bladed sashimi knife

I have speculated previously that Yasuko was the focus of the killer. Do you agree with this? 

Is there any hope of this case being solved almost 21 years on?

Why didn't the killer bring a weapon with him? it seems odd that he was prepared to brutally murder four people, but didn't take the extra step of bringing one with him",UnresolvedMysteries,Setagaya Murders: Still unsolved in 2021,0
462,VirtuallyDrunk,1640498025," Hello, all. This is a case near and dear to me, as I went to the same schools, as well as lived in the same general area as Tyler (Though I didn't know him or any of his family/friends personally).

This is his story, and his case.

On April 19th, 2016, Tyler Christensen dissapeared from Edmonds, WA. He was 16, almost 17 at the time he went missing (DOB: 06/02/1999). He weighed 145 pounds, and stood at 5'11. He was wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue shorts at the time of his dissapearance. Tyler is described as a Caucasian male, with light brown hair and blue eyes. As for any identifying features, he has a half-inch scar on his left ankle.

Tyler has four sisters, and his family describes him as hardworking and creative- he did odd jobs for his neighbors and made furniture and other crafts from metal and wood. He enjoyed hiking and riding his motorcycle. Tyler was also homeschooled.

Tyler was last seen in the 5300 block of Picnic Point, located in Edmonds, WA. He was seen at approximately 6:30pm on April 19th, 2016. Tyler had told his family he was going to jog to his youth group meeting, at the church him and his family attended, located in the 4700 block of 116th Street in Mukilteo, WA. This was about a mile from his home.

He never arrived to the meeting.

According to the local police, they belive he left of his own volition. I am not sure how they know this for sure, whether it be evidence or word of mouth, but they suspect he took a ferry from Edmonds to Kingston, WA, that same night.

The last person to see him was a man that picked him up; Tyler had been hitchhiking. The man described Tyler as ""upbeat"", and asked him directions to Shelton, WA (About 97 miles from his home; 1 hour and 40 minutes on via I-5 South)- informing the man he was going hiking at the Olympic National Park (About an hour from Shelton, WA).

In May, a month (give or take a few days) later, they located his dark-colored backpack near the High Steel Bridge, near Shelton, WA. Inside the backpack were a few emergency blankets, food, and extra clothing of his.

This was the last update in the case (as far as I could find). His page on the Charley Project webpage states he had no history of mental illness or runaway behavior. His family (and possibly his friends) hadnt witnessed any upset or odd behavior from him prior to his dissapearance. His family do not know why he would've run away in the first place.

Tyler's sister, Liz Christensen, stated she thinks he may be on an adventure, looking for something, but does not know exactly what he's looking for.

It's been almost 6 years since Tyler was last seen. He would currently be 22 years old. Tyler's DNA has been entered into federal databases for missing persons (stated in an article for the Heraldnet).

Sheri Ireton, a sheriff's office spokeswoman, stated ""It's still an open investigation."" (As of 2018).

There has been no update since then (from what I could find). I also couldn't find any information about the man who picked him up, or where he was picked up from. As far as I could find, they haven't named this man as a suspect currently.

The High Steeled Bridge, where his backpack was located, has had deaths in the past, from drowning or falls. The bridge is about 114m above the water/river.

465,Ar72,1640482671,"Patrick Warren and David Spencer were two English schoolboys who disappeared on 27 December 1996 in the town of Solihull, near Birmingham. Although initially treated by the police as runaways, they are now presumed to have died.Despite a BBC Crimewatch special report on the boys, along with numerous appeals from both their families, the case remains unsolved.

85-year-old convicted paedophile and sexual offender against young boys Brian Lunn Field has emerged as the main suspect in the presumed murder of the boys since his 2001 conviction for abducting 14-year-old schoolboy Roy Tutill in his car and murdering him in 1968. Field was living in Solihull in 1996 and is known to have been driving around in a white van in the vicinity of the boys' last known location on the night of their disappearance, while under the influence of alcohol. He had previously been convicted in 1986 of abducting two boys in his car and attempting to rape them. Police have on multiple occasions interviewed Field in prison about the boys' disappearance and suspect him of killing them, but have never had sufficient evidence to charge him.

On Boxing Day evening in 1996, best friends Patrick Warren and David Spencer left their Chelmsley Wood homes to play outside. Patrick left on his brand-new bicycle, which had been a Christmas present, while David was on foot.[3] The boys had been spotted by a police officer earlier that afternoon playing with another group of children in Meriden Park, where they had been warned by the officer not to play on the frozen pond. After returning home, they told their parents of their plans to visit one of Patrick's brothers that evening. Derek Warren, another of Patrick's brothers, went looking for the boys the next day when he found out that they had not arrived.

The last known sighting of the boys was just after midnight by a petrol station attendant who gave them a packet of biscuits. Patrick's brand-new red Apollo bicycle was found abandoned behind the petrol station near the bins, although the police did not realise that it was his until several weeks later. The petrol station attendant said she saw the boys walking toward the local shopping centre

470,Mobile-Accountant-97,1640454355,"Two little boys were out walking their dog on Boxing Day in 1959 when they came across the naked body of Lila Anderson, 38. She had a black skirt wrapped around her head. She had been abducted from a bus stop, dragged into a car, beaten with a tire iron and her head was then smashed against a rock. 

 Lila came from small town Rock Creek, BC and during the war served with the Royal Canadian Air Force as a sergeant cook. She moved to Vancouver after her discharge and first worked as an assistant night manager at the White Lunch and later as a cashier at the Safeway store at Broadway and Main Street.

In 1950 she bought a property on East 15th Avenue in East Vancouver and drew up blueprints for a boarding house. She hired a construction crew and supervised the work. When it was finished, she moved into the bottom suite and rented out the upstairs. Lila made it clear that her private life was her own business, and she expected her neighbours and friends to respect that. What they did know was that she loved to garden; she loved Mikie, her eight-year-old cat, and she was happy to stay at home and listen to the radio or watch television. Relatives and friends painted a picture of a quiet woman who liked her own company and preferred to live alone. She laughed at funny things, they said, was friendly to small children, and had a nice smile.

Lila told her sister and a neighbour that she had made plans for Christmas dinner but she didn’t say who with. No one saw her after she left home Christmas day. An autopsy determined that Lila had eaten about an hour before she was murdered.

“It is a dreadful commentary on a type of city as ours that such a crime could occur,” Vancouver Police Chief George Archer told the media. “Someone must have seen her travelling about the city, or at her Christmas dinner. Yet not one single witness had come forward to help with the investigation.”

Lila had two children both of whom she adopted out. Ross Dewar was born in 1947 and believes he has an older half-sister in Ontario. Ross recently connected with a half-brother from his father’s side after adding his DNA to the Ancestry.com genealogy databank.

473,irishspiderplant,1640440522,"Hello reddit, this is a post about a missing Irish man who disappeared in Grand Teton Park, Wyoming, in June 2021. It's awful to think of his poor family having Christmas without him and without knowing what happened to him or where he is. But I know that miracles can happen, especially in the case of missing hikers who are brought to this sub's attention. I am hoping there is a way that my fellow Irish person can be brought home to his family.

Cian McLaughlin (27) was last seen in Grand Teton Park, WY, on June 8, 2021. 

From RTE, Ireland's national broadcaster:

*A climbing guide reported seeing a solo hiker, matching Mr McLaughlin's description, on the Garnet Canyon Trail. His car was later found parked near Lupine Meadows.*

*His family has issued a new poster, appealing for help in finding the ""incredibly adored"" young man.*

*...*

*It details how Mr McLaughlin was wearing a red Apple Watch, white t-shirt, a pair of shorts (reportedly), wire rimmed sunglasses and a unique silver necklace on the day he went missing.*

*The family notes that Mr McLaughlin is ""an incredibly friendly person, it is likely that he would stop and chat with people or say hello in passing. We believe that he was alone"".*

More information from an October article on [Buckrail.com](https://Buckrail.com):

*The family of Cian McLaughlin, the missing hiker last seen in Grand Teton National Park, continues to search for McLaughlin ahead of winter.*

*Cian’s mother Gráinne McLaughlin, her partner, and her brother, Colm O’Higgins, have been hiking every day in the park in the hopes of finding any indications of where Cian might be.*

*RTE News recently reported* *on the ongoing search from Grand Teton National Park. “****This is not a rescue, it is a recovery but I’d like to bring him home. I know he is up there somewhere****,” Gráinne McLaughlin told RTE correspondent Brian O’Donovan.*

*Originally from Ireland, McLaughlin held dual citizenship. He had been living and working in Jackson prior to his disappearance.*

*McLaughlin was last seen on Tuesday, June 8, in the late afternoon/early evening on the trail on the south side of the Bradley/Taggart moraine. An individual reported that McLaughlin was headed south towards Taggart Lake and had a conversation with McLaughlin. He described where he worked, that he’s from Ireland and currently living in Jackson. The reporting party continued hiking towards Bradley Lake and did not see McLaughlin again that evening.*

474,verma2470,1640439687,"Back in the 1980s, something very unusual happened with a talented man with surprising mechanical skills and an immense passion for outer space and exploring the universe. One day, he wrote a note to his parents and disappeared. Canadian man Granger Taylor was only 32 when he vanished not long after building a life-sized spaceship that looked like a UFO in the backyard of his family’s farm.

 Taylor built a spaceship from the scrape metals in his yard that resembled a modern UFO. Using two satellite dishes, he created a living space almost like a treehouse. He equipped it with a TV, couch, and wood-burning stove. He spent a lot of time there thinking about the technology behind UFOs.

He left a note before leaving: 

 He wrote:

“Dear Mother and Father,

I have gone away to walk aboard an alien spaceship, as recurring dreams assured a 42-month interstellar voyage to explore the vast universe, then return. I am leaving behind all my possessions to you as I will no longer require the use of any. Please use the instructions in my will as a guide to help.

Love, Granger.”

When Halifax regional police shared a press release explaining the lockdown the city fell to it’s knees.

There was a shooting on Windmill Rd in Dartmouth. A young boy was injured in the shooting, transported to the IWK Children’s Hospital, but they were unable to save his life.

Four days before Christmas.

This release didn't share much more than that, no age or name or details, so of course rumours began to swirl.

When additional information was revealed it was via a Halifax regional police press conference, and it ended with an appeal to the public.

The victim, 8 year old Lee-Marion Cain was the occupant of a vehicle. The driver, a 25 year old man was also treated for non life threatening injuries. The suspects, two unidentified black men, shot from a burgundy SUV. 

Police are requesting anyone in the area with surveillance cameras to check their footage for the vehicle or people of interest.

480,tiposk,1640370500,"**FACTS** 

Michael Wayne Allan was a service manager in Plaza Dodge in Brooksville, Florida. He had divorced his wife around 1992 and had the custody of their boy since 1996. Allan had sued his ex-wife for child support and was scheduled for an appearance before a judge in November of 1997. 

On Halloween night of that same year, two weeks before the court appearance, Michael and his ex-wife Kelly Allan agreed that he would pick up his 7 year old son in Tampa to take him trick or treating. According to Kelly, he never made it to his destination. He was last seen leaving his job in Brooksville and nobody heard from or about him until someone spotted his 1989 Dodge Daytona in the parking lot of a shopping plaza at  40960 US Highway 19 N. in Tarpon Springs on November 25.  

Louie Houllis, a friend and co-worker of Michael said police told him that they found blood stains in Michael's vehicle, but this detail was never officially confirmed by authorities, as far as I know. 

In 2012, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced that remains found back in July of 1998 under the Howard Frankland Bridge in Tampa were positively identified as those of Michael. The remains were first believed to belong to an African-American  person, according to the Charley Project. Michael's case is being investigated as a murder.

**THEORIES**

Since Michael was headed to Tampa and his body was found there, I believe that he made it to the city or somewhere close enough. Whoever killed him disposed of his body in the Old Tampa Bay and drove his vehicle to Tarpon Springs. I don't believe Michael to have driven to Tarpon Springs and his body getting disposed of from another vehicle because Tarpon Springs is not on the way between Brooksville and Tampa.

Kelly is a natural 'suspect' since she was the person he was visiting in Tampa and the child support demand gave her a motive, but it is not clear if she is a person of interest in the case. Michael's mother also stated that she does not believe that Kelly was involved.

The police has a possible suspect and might know the manner of death, but this information has not been released to the public. In fact, there is not much information about this case which leads me to believe that authorities either do not know what happened or they know already but are struggling to find further evidence to make an arrest.

In June 2014, 28-year-old German tourist Lars Mittank traveled to the popular Golden Sands resort in Varna, Bulgaria, for a holiday with friends. After displaying unusual behaviour on the trip following a suspected beating, he bolted from the airport and was captured by cameras disappearing into a field of tall sunflowers. No trace of him has ever been found. Footage of his final known movements has been viewed over a million times on YouTube, leading to him being named ‘the world’s most famous missing tourist’.

Mittank and his friends arrived in Varna, a city on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, on 30th June 2014. A week later, while drinking in a bar with friends, Werder Bremen fan Mittank got into an altercation with fans of rival Bundesliga team Bayern Munich. After leaving the bar, Mittank disappeared, with his friends unable to locate him for the rest of the night. However, he turned up at their resort room the following morning, telling his friends he had been beaten by four men he had argued with in the bar the previous night. Some friends recalled his account differently, saying Mittank had told them the four Bayern fans had hired a local to do it for them.



Mittank photographed in 2013. Image: BKA Germany/Federal Criminal Police Office
An examination by a doctor found that Mittank did have injuries consistent with a fight, including a cracked jaw and ruptured ear drum. Prescibed antibiotics, Mittank was advised that due to his ear injury he would be unable to fly home with the rest of his party, that were due to depart that day. Reassuring his friends that he would be fine, Mittank checked out at the same time as them, before checking into the nearby Hotel Color Varna for one night.

It was during his night at the Hotel Color that Mittank began to demonstrate strange behaviour, appearing paranoid that he was being pursued by the group of men he claimed had beaten him the previous night. At one point he hid in an elevator for a prolonged period of time, before leaving the hotel at around midnight and only returning hours later. He even called his mother, asking her in a hushed voice to cancel his credit cards as four men were intending to kill him.

The following day, Mittank travelled to Varna airport, where he met with the airport doctor to discuss if his ear had healed sufficiently to allow him to fly home. During the conversation, it appears the pair were interrupted by a man who was working on a construction project in the airport. Startled, Mittank fled from the airport, wearing only a t-shirt and shorts, leaving the holdall bag he is seen carrying in earlier CCTV footage behind. Multiple cameras record him fleeing across the car park, before climbing a fence and disappearing into a field of sunflowers.",UnresolvedMysteries,"Where is Lars Mittank!!!????

486,acarter8,1640317796,"The Calumet County Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday that a set of remains found at High Cliff State Park in September 2021 are those of Starkie Swenson, a Neenah man who disappeared in 1983. They were identified through DNA analysis.


Starkie L. Swenson, aged 67, disappeared on August 13, 1983. He had returned to his Lakeshore Avenue home in Neenah, WI from a family picnic, and then took his bicycle and pedaled off into the evening. He never returned. His family reported him missing and issued pleas for help on August 18th, 1983.


In July of 1984, his family held a memorial service for Swenson with his wife, Lois Swenson, saying, ""In our hearts, we know he is dead.""


Swenson was declared legally dead in 1990 after a hearing before a Winnebago County judge. The death certificate says Swenson died on Aug. 13, 1983.


Fast forward to September 1993 when John C. Andrews, a 54-year-old Neenah man, was arrested on a first-degree murder charge in connection with Swenson's death. Police stated that Swenson was having an affair with Andrews' ex-wife at the time of his disappearance. 

A woman had come forward with basically ""ear-witness testimony"" claiming that she had heard her boyfriend at the time, John Andrews, ran over Starkie Swenson. That confrontation took place in the parking lot of Shattuck Junior High School (now the Shattuck Middle School) in Neenah.


Andrews accepted a plea deal in 1994 for a reduced charge of homicide by the negligent use of a vehicle. He was sentenced to 24 months in jail. Because Andrews was convicted of the homicide charge, the D.A. cannot add additional homicide charges now that Swenson’s remains have been identified. “The ability to charge someone for the murder of Starkie Swenson is gone. Mr. Andrews was charged and prosecuted,” said Haberman.


It wasn't until September 29, 2021, that hikers found Swenson's remains on a trail in a partially secluded area at High Cliff State Park in Sherwood, WI. This site is approximately 12 to 13 miles from the school parking lot where the confrontation took place, but the sheriff's office gave no indication of how the remains ended up at the park.

There isn’t much info on CP, so I decided to do a google search on her – and this is where it gets weirder and weirder. There isn’t much at all about her out there except for one websleuths thread from almost two years ago. The more I read, the more confusing it got. I’m gonna try and summarize what little information there is and hopefully we can have a discussion – I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts and opinions on this case. 

**Background info:** Amery Kenny David was born on 10/7/1991 in the Philippines. According to her family, Amery met a middle-aged American male named “John Bohland” while studying in Manila in 2014. Later, Amery allegedly contacted her family and told them that she flew to Washington State to marry John and that they got married in Spokane in February 2015. Amery’s family claim that they never met their daughter’s husband. Later, Amery told her family that her husband had passed away. The family last heard from Amery via phone sometime in October 2016. When they didn’t hear from her, Amery’s family reported her missing to Spokane police. Her mother told authorities that Amery had passed the CPA exam in September 2016 and that she told her family she would be sending them money once she received her first paycheck. The family did not know what school Amery attended in Washington. LE has not been able to corroborate any of the information provided by the family.

**Here’s where it gets really strange:** According to LE, there is “no record” of John Bohland or Amery Kenny David/Amery Bohland anywhere. Users on Websleuths say that a search on the name “John Bohland” in Washington State did not yield any results and that there was no obituary for any person with that name. Furthermore, there was no marriage certificate or license for Amery Kenny David or John Bohland anywhere in the WA State public database. 

Amery did not seem to have a big online presence. There is a facebook profile with her name and picture that was set up about a month before she went missing and a few inactive twitter accounts, as well as an Instagram account that has since been deleted. She has 8 friends on facebook, including someone who’s most likely her mother, and she hasn’t been active since September on facebook 2016 either.

I really wish I could make this post more detailed, but this is really all the information there is.

**Questions:**

**1.** **Is it possible that Amery was never really in the U.S.?** If she passed a CPA exam like the family claims, there should be a record of that. If she attended college, there should be a record of that.  The fact that the police can’t find any trace of her in Spokane or anywhere else in the country makes me wonder if she was ever really there. But then again, would they even agree to investigate her disappearance if they didn’t have reason to believe that she was there? There should be some immigration records on her.

**2.** **What about the husband?** It looks like “John Bohland” never existed, so whom was Amery married to? Did he give her a false name? Was there ever a husband?

**3.** **Did the family fabricate everything?** If so, why would they do so?  

I’d love to hear everyone’s theories on this!

492,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,1640274828," Jack Wheeler held many important positions throughout his lifetime: he was a chairman for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund; a senior planner for Amtrak; an official of the Securities and Exchange Commission; a CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving; consultant to the Mitre Corporation; and presidential aide to Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.  
Jack disappeared on December 28, 2010, after exiting an Amtrak train near Wilmington, Delaware. He was later seen on December 30 at 10th and Orange streets in Wilmington. On December 31, his body was discovered by a landfill worker as it fell onto a trash heap in the Cherry Island Landfill. His death was later ruled a homicide. His death was due to ""assault"" and ""blunt force trauma"". It was determined that all of the stops the garbage truck had made that day involved large commercial disposal bins in Newark, a few miles from Jack's home.  
Prior to Jack's death, he was sighted several times. On December 29, he was sighted at the New Castle County courthouse parking garage. He was disoriented and wearing only one shoe. He tried to gain access of the garage on foot, claiming that he wanted to warm up before paying the parking fee. He told the attendant that his briefcase had been stolen. He also said that he was not intoxicated. It was later determined that his car was in a different garage.  
Later that day, Jack asked a pharmacist in New Castle for a ride to Wilmington. He reportedly looked upset at the time. The pharmacist offered to call him a cab. He then left the store. On December 30, he was seen wandering around various office buildings, including Mitre and DuPont. Several people asked if he needed help, but he refused any assistance.

She was 37 at the time of her disappearance (she would be 80 today), and had six children.  She had left her house to visit Gilles Ledenberchstraat Amsterdam Oud-West , which is a high end residential street in Amsterdam. She was never heard from again, and was reported missing the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before she went missing , she was searching for her passport. Its unknown if she had taken it with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Another strange detail, is that after she went missing, two unidentified men came to her house . The men were looking for photo albums of her. Only her children were home at the time and they thought they were the cops.  But the Amsterdam police never came to her house.

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds like a human trafficking case , due to her having an interest in finding her passport. But why would her traffickers , come back to her house and ask for a photo album of her?  Her children thought they were the police , they were probably dressed in suits (or high business attire).  If she took her passport with her, to go to a affluent neighborhood , then the unidentified men were probably her kidnapers. No trace of her has ever been found, and its unknown where her passport is . I don't know if she was going through a divorce or if she was suffering from depression .

Text from a recent (April 2021) article...

After nearly three decades the disappearance of a Salina woman is still a mystery.  Thursday will mark another year of one of the most well-known missing person cases in Salina. It will be 28 years since Kathryn Adam was last seen.
On April 29th, 1993, 35-year-old Kathryn Adam went missing.
Adam was last seen at 4:30 in the morning that day, at a Kwik Shop convenience store in the 1700 block of West Crawford Street. She was preparing to head out on her job delivering hosiery. She was driving a full-sized Ford van with “She has L’eggs” written on the sides in blue lettering.
Adam was reported missing the next day, April 30th, by her 16-year-old daughter. The L’eggs van van turned up abandoned at 5:45 that evening outside a nearby restaurant. It was found at Russell’s Restaurant, which at the time was closed for remodeling, at 649 Westport Boulevard.
The van was spattered with mud on the outside, and had blood in the inside. Blood was also found at a storage unit in West Salina on Centennial Road where Adam picked up stock each day.
Police speculate someone attacked Adam when she went inside the storage unit. It appeared they interrupted her in the process of loading the merchandise in her van, leaving the door of the unit opened.
Though it is a cold case, it is still open. And though no body has ever been recovered, it is classified as a homicide.
Investigators periodically review the case, go over it, and remain hopeful in solving it. Things like changes in modern technology, and tips that trickle in help keep it active.
Early last week a human skull was found in an area of west Salina, in the same general area of the storage unit. Law enforcement are not able to make a positive identification of the skull at this time.  The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is assisting the Saline County Sheriff’s Office in the investigation. Saline County Sheriff Roger Soldan says that it appears that the skull had been in that spot for quite a while
Police encourage anyone with any possible information, no matter how small or insignificant they think it may be, to come forward. They can call Crimestoppers at 825-TIPS, text SATIPS to CRIMES (274637), or visit Salina Police Department and follow the Crimestoppers link to submit a web tip.
The Kathryn Adam case is featured on several social media sites dedicated to missing person cases. It is featured on Kansas Missing And Unsolved on Facebook, and also has its own Find Kathryn Adam page.

498,queefunder,1640207062,"It’s been six years since Michigan State Police say someone hit and killed Central Michigan University student Ryan Tsatsos as he was walking back to campus.

But there still hasn’t been an arrest in the case.

Paul and Julie Tsatsos say their son Ryan was always known as the life of the party, a young man who could make any bad situation good.

""He would do anything in his power to make you smile. If you were in the worst mood you were in the harder he would try,” said Paul.

That all changed in the early morning of November 1st 2015.

Ryan was walking along a stretch of road near the CMU campus, back to his residence hall with a group of friends.

“About quarter after two we got the knock on the door and I looked at who it was and I told him oh my gosh don’t even,” said Julie.

“I opened the door and they asked if we were the parents of Ryan Tsastos and I said something like is someone in jail is anybody hurt and they said can we come in and that’s when I noticed the chaplain was with them,” recalled Paul.

Paul and Julie lost their older son Darryl in a crash just months earlier.

Friends say Ryan died a hero, pushing a girl out of the way of the oncoming car before it hit him.

Tips began coming in to State Police shortly after, they believe the vehicle that hit Ryan has a dark metallic blue color and likely had damage on the passenger side.

Paul and Julie also traveled to Mount Pleasant shortly after the hit and run to make a direct appeal for tips.

But six years later, the case remains open.

If you have any information about who may have hit and killed Ryan, call Michigan State Police in Mount Pleasant, at (989) 773-5951.

You can also submit tip anonymously through [Crime Stoppers](https://www.crimestoppersofflint.com/).

BOISE, Idaho — *This article originally appeared in the* [*Idaho Press*](https://www.idahopress.com/)*.*

A man died of cyanide poisoning in Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Boise in 1982, where he left a note with his name signed on it. Only, Boise Police confirmed it wasn’t his real name — and the man is still unidentified to this day.

A national cyanide controversy from 1982, a priest murder, a cryptic note and a false identity are all part of the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death.

When nurse and church goer Virginia Almquist walked into Sacred Heart 39 years ago for mass on Dec. 3, she was approached by the church usher, Leo Leeburn, in a panic. His mother, Grace Leeburn, had discovered a dead man.

The man was found outside the confessional booth, face down and slumped over in the fifth pew. He was clean shaven with tan skin, sandy blonde hair, dressed in blue jeans, a green long-sleeved shirt accented with a turquoise bolo tie, a Seiko watch wrapped around his wrist, and cowboy boots fitted on his feet, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. He was believed to be between 35-45 years old.

The tale of the mystery man in the church was re-told in the family often, said Almquist’s daughter, Sharon Job.

On that cold December day, Job said, Almquist reached down to take the man’s pulse but found there was none.

“He was cold,” Job said.

Almquist rushed outside seeking Father Faucher, the priest at the time, who lived near the church.

On her way out, Almquist stopped Sister Mary Louise Deroin, who pulled up to Sacred Heart Church in her car for evening mass.

Deroin currently resides in Ventura, California, where she moved after retiring from being a Sister of the Holy Cross at Saint Alphonsus Medical Center.

“Virginia came out of the church and ran to the car before I could even get out. She told me that they had just noticed a man under a pew in the church,” Deroin told the Idaho Press in an interview. “She told me he was dead because she checked him.”

Deroin bolted inside the rectory and called police.

“I didn’t have a chance to see him. I didn’t want to,” Deroin said.

On Dec. 20 1982, the church held a funeral service for the mystery man. He was laid to rest in a gray coffin.

“He knew if he came to a church he’d be taken care of,” Faucher said.

### INVESTIGATION

According to United Press International News [archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/28/A-mystery-man-who-took-a-fatal-dose-of/1669409899600), a toxicology report stated the man had died of cyanide poisoning.

When the Boise Police Department arrived on the scene, officers found the man in a slumped over, kneeling position. After rolling him over, police found a cryptic suicide note written with a typewriter and $1,900 in cash inside a brown envelope in his shirt pocket, according to a police report. Coroner Mike Roberts estimated his time of death to be around noon. Witnesses found the man five hours later.

The note began with, “In the event of my death,” and instructed whoever found him to use the money enclosed for his funeral. Leftover money should be donated to the church, the note said. It also stated that the man wished to be cremated.

The note ended with the remark: “God will see to your honesty in this.”

The letter was signed “Wm. L. Toomey.”

But police could never confirm that was the man’s real name.

The police report stated the man’s wallet was empty with the exception of $53. All other forms of identification had been discarded, the report said. There was no way to put a name to the mysterious man.

“My mom was always sad his family never knew,” Job said. “We always said we wish they could find out who he was.”

Boise Police detective Frank Richardson, seven years later, said in a 1991 episode of “Unsolved Mysteries” that all leads to connect the man to the name William Toomey were exhausted, and he likely used a pseudonym.

“They kept his body at the morgue for a while to see if there was family they could contact,” Deroin said. “But, they couldn’t.”

Richardson said he later discovered “Toomey” was the name of a company that manufactured priest and nun garb, according to a [2005 article from The Austin Chronicle.](https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2005-06-17/275319)

Richardson said in the episode police believed the man was from somewhere in the southwest United States, such as Texas or New Mexico, because of his sun tan in the middle of winter, bolo tie and large accented belt buckle with a Mexican coin in the middle.

Boise Police told the Idaho Press that currently no one in the department is working to confirm the man’s identity 39 years later with DNA, however the case is still classified as an open investigation.

### THE TYLENOL MURDERS

Deroin said the fact the mystery man poisoned himself with cyanide was odd because two months before his death, a national panic ensued regarding Tylenol laced with cyanide.

The events left seven people dead in Chicago and is known to this day as “The Tylenol Murders,” which remain unsolved.

“Maybe he was responsible (for the murders), came out and committed suicide for it, since he died of cyanide,” Deroin said.

According to [The Washington Post,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/10/03/poisoning-is-traced-to-stores/4bfb56fa-88bb-4ac6-a97a-b698d39119c7) the Tylenol laced with cyanide came from two different manufacturing facilities — one in Pennsylvania, and one in Texas. One bottle was found to have 14 laced capsules out of the 50 in the bottle.

Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled more than 31 million bottles of Tylenol in circulation.

Others also echoed this odd coincidence. Jeff Wade, a Boise crime writer and researcher, has heavily researched the Boise John Doe. He said it seemed “interesting” and worth looking into that the man could be from Texas, where the cyanide-laced Tylenol was manufactured. The murders came just two months before the man poisoned himself with cyanide.

Additionally, a man from Texas died from a cyanide-laced pill in 1986, four years later.

Wade referenced the coincidental Tylenol murders, and stated he doesn’t believe cyanide was too hard to get at the time of both incidents.

### THEORIES

Robin Warder, host of “The Trail Went Cold” [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-trail-went-cold/id1084020770?i=1000391103303), featured Toomey’s case on an episode of her show, which focuses on unsolved mysteries and cold cases.

Warder told the Idaho Press she believes Toomey had a personal connection to Sacred Heart Church since he took his life there.

“I know that suicide is considered a mortal sin in Catholicism, so I’ve always wondered if he made a calculated decision to ingest the cyanide and hoped that he could receive absolution from the priest in the confessional before it took effect,” she said.

“However, since the confessional was occupied at the time, he died before he could actually see the priest.”

Deroin said there were few people in the church at the time, and no one noticed the man sitting toward the back of the numerous rows of pews.

Wade echoed the same belief, adding that it’s possible the man may have been molested by a priest and went into the church seeking some sort of revenge or recognition, but never was able to find it.

Wade also mentioned a possible connection to murders of two priests in Odessa, Texas. This theory potentially takes the cold case to Texas and Arizona.

According to the 2005 Austin Chronicle article, Father Patrick Ryan, a priest in Texas, was violently murdered in a hotel room in December 1981. A man named James Reyos was imprisoned in connection to Ryan’s death.

Additionally, another priest, Father Benjamin Carrier, was murdered in a hotel room in Arizona, the article stated.

Richardson was suspicious of these two murders being connected to his years-long cold case in some way, as he believed Toomey was affiliated with the Catholic Church.

Richardson had even traced Toomey’s belt buckle to a gift shop in Arizona, but that led nowhere, according to the “Unsolved Mysteries” episode. Toomey’s fingerprints were taken, which also led nowhere. To Richardson, that meant he was never convicted of a crime, wasn’t enlisted in the military and was not a member of a licensed profession.

For these reasons, Reyos’ defenders believe Toomey could be responsible for the deaths of Ryan and Carrier — Toomey had been in Arizona at one time, and he could have been a priest, someone who didn’t need fingerprints to just “pop up” in places, the article said.

“Toomey could have killed Ryan,” Wade said. He couldn’t say why Richardson felt there was a connection, but said “it had to be something strong.”

### FINAL RESTING PLACE

Dry Creek Cemetery is located off Old Horseshoe Bend Road in Eagle. The cemetery is quaint, with vast fields holding remains of loved ones that are scattered up and down the hillside.

Toomey resides there to this day. His gravesite is somber.

Falling snow clung to the surrounding grass in mid-December. The ground was coated with ice, and brown leaves covered Toomey’s headstone.

Toomey’s headstone is not much of a headstone at all, rather a slab of gravel and rock. He resides next to other unknown and unclaimed dead, who remain in the cemetery with similar headstones.

It almost looks as though his name was carved into the rock with a dull knife — the words are faded and barely readable after 39 years of weather and wear.

Job said her mother told his story “until she died.”

“My mother was always sad for him and his family,” Job said.

The story never changed, Job said, but there was always a sadness surrounding the local mystery.

Today, Boise Sacred Heart Church leaders refer to the unknown man who poisoned himself as the “Boise John Doe” — someone whose identity may never be revealed.

500,Quirky-Motor,1640201402,"**Disappearance**

On August 30th, 1979, two girls Carlota Sanchez and Elsie Luscier, aged 12 and 13 respectively,  left the village of Taholah on the Quinault Indian Reservation in southwest Washington state. According to Wikipedia, the hamlet of Taholah is a census designated place with a few hundred residents. One report says the girls left Aberdeen, Washington not Taholah. The girls may have been traveling to Seattle, Washington to visit their grandmother on another Indian reservation. It is not known which specific reservation this relative lived on. Some reports state the girls may have traveled to Arizona. However, most reports claim that the girls ran away from home. Whatever the circumstances, neither child was ever seen again.

According to a family member’s post online, both girls were reported missing in September of 1980, one year after they were last seen. Family members contacted both the Seattle Police Department as well as the Aberdeen Police department.  Namus, on the other hand, reports that the initial report came from Taholah authorities. Apparently the two departments (Seattle and Aberdeen) tossed the case back and forth between them until the stories of the two cousins fell through the cracks for good. 

In 2003 after the conviction of Gary Ridgway, Carlota’s sister contacted the Green River Task force to make sure they were aware of Carlota’s disappearance but they claimed they had never heard of Carlota’s case. This is probably because Carlota was reported missing to the SPD, not the King County Sheriff's office who handled the Green River Investigation. (Carlota also disappeared before Ridgway’s first known murders and was younger than his known victims.) However, it was this phone call that started, for the first time, the search for cousins Elsie Luscier and Carlota Sanchez. Dentals and DNA were collected from family members for comparisons to Jane Does but no matches were found.

In 2011 a relative of Carlota discovered the case of Fly Creek Jane doe, a young murder victim who was found in 1980 in Clark Co. Washington. Due to similarities in facial structure and a video the family made which is no longer available on Youtube, the family became convinced that this woman was Carlota. DNA returned not a match in 2011 and in 2019, Fly Creek Jane Doe was identified as Sandy Morden, a teen from the Portland area. Namus lists both cousins as rule outs for the Fly Creek doe. Despite the match, Carlota’s relatives are still convinced that the skeleton found near Fly Creek belongs to Carlota and they are using social media to find an attorney willing to take on their case. Besides several social media posts from the family, no progress has been made in the cases of either Elsie or Carlota as far as I can tell.

**Descriptions**

At the time of last contact, Carlota Maria Sanchez was only 12 years old. She was visiting relatives for the summer in Washington state, but lived full time in Yuma, Arizona. Carlota is described as a biracial female, being of Native American and Hispanic, specifically Cuban, descent although one report claims that Carlota is multi-racial of Swiss, Native American, and Cuban descent. She was 5’5”-5’7'' in height and weighed 110 lbs. when she was last seen. She has long straight dark brown hair, brown eyes, and a half moon shaped scar on her palm. She was born with two sets of eye teeth, but one set was surgically removed. She may go by the name Maria Loop and may spell her first name Carlotta. She usually wears blue jeans. Carlota has pierced ears. Her dentals and DNA are available for comparison. Her tribal affiliation is unknown.

It is unclear where Elsie lived although reports make it sound as if lived in Washington state. Elsie is described as a Native American female, only 13 years old. She weighed 110 lbs. and stood 5’1” tall. She had dark brown hair and eyes. In 1979 her hair was cut short, above the collar, and was wavy or curly. Like her cousin, her tribal affiliation is unknown.

Both girls have been ruled out as Fly Creek Jane Doe, and both are also ruled out as being Tucson Doe, which can be read about [here](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Tucson_Jane_Doe_(1979)).  I have submitted both girls as possible identities for Kalama Helen Doe who I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/lnv1b9/extensive_write_up_on_the_bizarre_case_of_helen/).

Strangely, for years the only information available on the cases revolved around Carlota and it wasn’t until 2013 that Elsie was revealed to also be missing. Before that all information on the case only mentioned Carlota as missing although one report said that Carlota “ran away with a cousin.” Although little information is available regarding the disappearance of Carlota, even less is available about Elsie. Elsie first got a Namus page trecently, and only got a Charley Project page in the last few years.

Today, the Seattle Police department is the investigating agency and in one press release for National Missing Children’s day, the SPD alleged that the two girls were last seen in downtown Seattle, not Taholah.  If you have any information regarding the case of either girl please call the Seattle Police department at 206-684-5455. Or if you have any other information on these two missing children please feel free to share below if you are comfortable doing so. 

What happened to Carlota and Elsie?

502,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,1640188770,"  Thirty-two-year-old Rey Rivera was a writer and aspiring filmmaker who recently moved to Baltimore with his wife, Allison, at the behest of his best friend, Porter Stansbury. On May 16, 2006, he left his home in a hurry. His body was found on May 23 at the Belvedere Hotel. His death was ruled undetermined by the medical examiner. Police believe he committed suicide. His family disagrees with the suicide notion and believe he was murdered.  
Rey was very close to his family; growing up, his father was in the military, so he and his family were constantly moving. As a result, they spent most of the time with each other. In November 2005, he and Allison married in Puerto Rico. His family described him as happy and fun-loving. According to Allison, his dream was to become a writer and director. They had previously lived in southern California where he hoped to become a filmmaker. However, the jobs he could find were not bringing in much money.  
Rey turned to Porter, who was living in Baltimore. They had been friends since high school and played water polo together. After high school, they remained friends. Porter had a company, Stansberry Associates, that wrote financial newsletters. He had always wanted Rey to come write for him. Even though Rey did not know finance or stocks, Porter was persistent and really wanted to work with him.  
In December 2004, Rey took a job writing financial newsletters for Porter in Baltimore. He and Allison moved there but knew little of the area. They made a pact that they were going to live there for twenty-four months. They soon found a great home, church, and community there. According to Allison, they were very happy there.  
On May 16, 2006, Allison prepared to leave for a business trip. That morning, Rey woke up with her and made her breakfast. Before she left, he carried her suitcase for her and put it in her car. She then left for a three-hour drive. At around 6pm, after finishing her meetings, she checked into the hotel and called him. However, he did not answer, which she felt was strange.  
At the time, Rey and Allison had a house guest, Claudia, who was a work colleague of Allison's. Later that night, Allison called her and asked about Rey. She said that at around 6:30pm, she had heard him answer a call on his cell phone. She then heard him run out of the house in a hurry. While on the phone with Allison, she checked around the house and noticed that all of the lights were on. However, he had not returned home. The next morning at 5:30am, Claudia called Allison and told her that he still had not returned.  
Allison was certain that something was wrong. She immediately left her hotel and returned home. She called Rey's family and friends, but no one had heard from him. His brother, Angel, was certain that something had happened to him. That afternoon, he flew to Baltimore to help search for him. When Allison arrived home, she noticed that his car was not there. In the kitchen, she found an opened soda can, a bag of chips, and his Invisaligns. Upstairs, she noticed that the bedroom light and office light were on.  
At around 7pm, Angel arrived in Baltimore. By then, Claudia had returned to New York. Rey's mother, Maria, and Allison's parents arrived in Baltimore soon after to help in the search. Allison called several hospitals to see if he had been checked into them as a ""John Doe"". Porter put up a reward of $1,000 for information on his whereabouts. He was also able to get the media involved in this case.  
Rey's family and friends went to different places in Baltimore, including various coffee shops and restaurants, in the hopes that someone might have seen him. However, no one reported doing so. Allison noted that his credit cards were never used, his cell phone was dead, and there was no activity on their bank accounts. His loved ones feared the worst, but knew that they had to keep searching for him.  
On May 22, Allison's parents decided to search for his car in several parking lots in Baltimore. They eventually found it in spot #7 in one behind a building on St. Paul Street. When found, it had a ticket on it. The parking attendant told Allison that it most likely was parked there on the evening of Rey's disappearance, as he had found it there the following morning. She could not understand why he was there.  
Rey's car was found near the Belvedere, which is a historic hotel which now includes condominiums, along with restaurants, bars, and lounges. The company that he worked for, Stansberry &amp; Associates, is also nearby. Therefore, it did not seem that unusual that he would be in that part of town. Multiple searches were conducted in the area surrounding where his car was found.  
On May 24, three of Rey's coworkers decided to go to the top of the parking garage next to the Belvedere. When they looked over the edge, they spotted flip-flops on the lower roof area, near a hole in it. They immediately called the police. Officers arrived and had a manager open the door to the conference room with the hole in the roof. Inside, they found Rey's body on the floor. His family was told the news at Baltimore Police Headquarters later that day.  
As Rey's family and friends mourned his death, police began to investigate it. His body was found in a prone position and was heavily decomposed. Eight days had passed from his disappearance to the discovery of his body. Despite the decomposition, the medical examiner discovered multiple fractured ribs, punctured lungs, lacerations, damage to the skull, and two fractures to the right leg. With the extent of the injuries, it appeared that he had come from great heights when he went through the roof. Investigators noticed that the hole was clean and not too large. Rey apparently fell through it vertically.  
The biggest question became: where did he come from and how did he get through the hole? The first theory was that he either jumped off, fell off, or was pushed off the top roof and went through the lower one, which was about ten stories down. The top one was an approximately forty-foot open area. However, there are several different structures there, such as air conditioning units and air ducts. There was approximately forty-five feet between the edge of the roof and the hole.  
Detective Michael Baier felt that it would have been virtually impossible for Rey to have made the jump, especially in flip-flops. Allison recalled that he was very afraid of heights and would have been scared to be up on the roof as there was no railing. She could find no reason for him to be up there. Baier did not believe that he had jumped from the roof.  
The second theory was that Rey jumped from the parking garage where his coworkers had discovered the hole. The distance from the garage to it was about twenty feet. The height from the lower roof to the garage was also about twenty feet. Baier felt that a jump from the garage into the roof would have been survivable. Also, he did not believe that the injuries to Rey's body matched with a fall from that height. As a result, he ruled out this theory.  
The third theory was that Rey fell from a ledge on the eleventh floor. The ledge wraps around the building. However, he could only access it by going through either an office or someone's condo. Also, the windows were ""half windows"" which barely opened at all. Furthermore, the ledge was small and it would have been difficult to maneuver it without falling off of it. Due to the conflicting evidence, it has not been determined where he exactly fell from.  
During the investigation of the hole in the roof, Rey's cell phone was found. Strangely, there was little damage to it and it still worked. His glasses were found nearby. They also had little damage to them. WBAL-TV reporter Jayne Miller became interested in this case and reported on it several times. She felt it was strange that his cell phone and glasses had little damage despite the force that was needed to push him through the roof. Also on it were his flip-flops; one was broken while the other was not. Allison noticed what appeared to be drag marks on one. Baier believed that the evidence on the roof was staged. Rey's money clip was not found on his body. He usually kept his money, identification, and other items in it. They have never been recovered.  
Investigative journalist Stephen Janis looked into Rey's death. He asked several people at the hotel if they had seen him or heard anything that night. However, no one reported seeing him or hearing anything. Angel tried to recreate Rey's movements that night. He tried to walk through the lobby and upstairs to the roof. However, he does not believe that Rey would have been able to do this without being noticed or stopped.He noted that there are several back stairways and hallways that he would have had to navigate through before reaching the roof. Jayne noted that the door to the roof area was usually locked. It appeared that he would have had to know how to get there beforehand.  
Baier checked the cameras to the hotel but could find no trace of Rey. Unfortunately, the one on the roof was disconnected. According to Baier, no one could give him any indication that Rey was in the building that night. There were no witnesses or phone calls that placed him there. Despite the inconsistencies in this case, the Baltimore police ruled his death a suicide.  
Rey's family and friends do not believe that he committed suicide. Angel noted that he was not under any mental duress or psychoactive medications. Allison felt that they were in a very happy point in their lives. She claimed that he wanted to start a family with her. Jayne did not believe that there was any evidence that suggested he wanted to commit suicide.  
Allison met with the medical examiner who was involved in this case. The examiner said that they were not planning to close it, despite the police department's ruling. The examiner told her that the way his shins were broken was not consistent with a fall. However, they would not say how they believed the injuries actually occurred. Based on the inconsistencies in this case, the examiner declared the manner of death as ""undetermined"". This meant that they did not have enough evidence to determine if his death was a suicide, accident, or murder.  
While Rey was still missing, Allison was searching through their house when she found a note taped to the back of the computer in their office. It text was shrunk down to a very small font size. She determined that it had been written on the day of his disappearance because there were scraps of it in the trash can. It said, in part: *Brothers and Sisters, Right now, around the world, volcanos are erupting. What an awesome sight...whom virtue unites, death will not separate.*  
The note had different names on it, such as movie star and family ones. Baier considered it to be ""very unusual"". Allison noted that there was an entire page which listed people that he knew. However, some important people in his life were not included. There was also a list of movies that ""stuck with him"". Allison did not understand what the note meant as a whole. In it, he continued: *I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets. That's why I cherish them as secrets.*  
Allison decided to take the first sentence from the note and do a Google search on it. The first thing that came up had to do with the Freemasons. She noted that Rey was curious about secret societies such as them. She suspected that he may have been wanting to do a screenplay about them. Jayne felt that the note was cryptic and may have been written in code. In it, he also stated: *That was a well-played game. Congratulations, to all who participated.*  
Rey was known as a prolific writer and he wrote a great amount of stuff in different places. Allison recalled that he would often write about many different things on the same page of paper that would not make sense to anyone but him. The note continued: *Life is a test to see if you can control your spirit. Take care and enjoy the festivities.* Allison immediately gave tit to the police, who then sent it to an FBI lab. The lab determined that it, while unusual, was not a suicide one. Allison also does not believe that it was so.  
Another bizarre aspect of this case was Rey's abrupt departure from his home on the day of his disappearance. He did not take much with him on that day. It appeared that whatever sent him to the Belvedere seemed to happen in a hurry. Claudia recalled to Allison how she heard him answer the phone from his office and then quickly run down the stairs and leave the house without explanation. The phone conversation was brief and ended with the exclamation ""Oh."" The police traced it and determined that it had come from Stansberry &amp; Associates. However, there was no way to determine who made it because it came from a switchboard and they could not track down the extension.  
Once Rey's body was found and police tried to question Stansberry employees, the company put a gag order on the whole staff. They were not allowed to talk to police, according to the company lawyers. Porter did not return calls from the police and has not spoken about this case since the discovery of Rey's body. Baier believed that this was suspicious. Allison felt similarly; she did not understand why he would not want to talk to anyone about Rey's death.  
At the time of Rey's disappearance, he was a freelance videographer for Stansberry &amp; Associates, producing documentaries and videos of conferences. Prior to that, he was working on a newsletter called the ""Rebound Report"" which gives the reader stock tips to buy stocks that are currently not doing well but will rebound in the future. Before he came to Baltimore, Porter put out a letter under a firm called Pirate Investors that touted the investment in a Russian firm that planned to discover Uranium. However, the tip did not work out and investors complained.  
Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC) filed fraud charges against Porter and fined him approximately $1.5 million. The company claimed that it was their First Amendment right to give the advice about the Russian firm. However, according to the SEC, the advice was fraudulent. According to Allison, one of the reasons Rey came to Baltimore was to help ""clean up"" Porter and the company's reputation in response to the fraud allegations.  
About two weeks before Rey's death, Allison noticed that something was worrying him. She did not think much of it at the time. However, at 1am on Monday, May 15, the day before he vanished, the house alarm went off. When she went to investigate, he came quickly out of another room with a baseball bat. She noticed that he was extremely frightened by the alarm. This concerned her because he normally was not afraid of anything.  
The police came out to investigate the alarm. However, they told Allison that a squirrel had probably triggered it. The following Tuesday at 1am, it went off again. She noticed that the window, which was on the ground floor, had been tampered with. She believes that someone was trying to get into their house. She also believes that the incidents were connected to Rey's death.  
Allison believes that Rey found some kind of information that he was not supposed to find and was murdered because of it. However, she does not know what information he would have uncovered that would have led to him being killed over it. Meanwhile, Angel believes that his death was money-related. He suspects that someone lost a lot of money because of his ""Rebound Report"" and killed him over it. Jayne also believes that foul play was involved in his death and does not believe he committed suicide.  
Baier cautioned Allison about investigating Rey's death and believed that she may be in danger of the same people that allegedly killed him. He believed that he was the only homicide detective involved in this case that did not believe his death was a suicide. He believes that there is enough evidence to investigate it as a homicide. However, three weeks into the investigation, he was reassigned.  
The Baltimore Police Department continues to insist that Rey committed suicide. However, the medical examiner still considers the case ""open"". Baier believes that someone Rey worked with may have information that could help solve this case. His family is still hoping for a resolution to his case.  
**Suspects:** Porter is considered a possible suspect in Rey's death. Prior to his death, he had worked on a report that involved a stock tip about a Russian firm. It did not work out and investors complained. The SEC became involved and accused Stansberry &amp; Associates of fraud. Rey's family believes that these allegations may have had something to do with his death.  
On the night Rey disappeared, he received a call from someone at Stansberry &amp; Associates. He left his home immediately after. The caller's identity remains unknown.  
After Rey's body was found, a gag order was reportedly placed on all of the employees at Stansberry &amp; Associates. As a result, they were not allowed to talk to the police about this case. Porter has not spoken to police about it since then. His family suspects that Porter may have been involved.  
Angel also suspects that Rey may have been murdered by someone who lost money because of the bogus stock tip.  
**Extra Notes:** This case was first released on July 1, 2020 as a part of the first volume of the Netflix reboot of *Unsolved Mysteries*.  
Porter Stansberry declined requests to be interviewed for the case.  
**Results:** Unsolved. As a result of the broadcast, several tips were received about this case. However, it is not known if these tips have led to anything substantial. One online theory that has been brought up by a viewer involves one of the movies that Rey mentioned in his note: [The Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(1997_film)). In it, the main character jumps off of a roof and crashes through a glass ceiling. There has been speculation that Rey may have tried to recreate this scene, leading to his death. This has not been confirmed.  
There is some evidence not included in the broadcast that supports the theory of suicide. The FBI released a report stating that they believed Rey suffered from bipolar disorder. He and Allison were reportedly not happy with living in Baltimore. He also had been to the Belvedere several times before his death. Furthermore, he was friends with two bartenders who worked at a bar located on the thirteenth floor. They would often take smoke breaks on the roof; this suggested that he would have known how to access the roof of the hotel.  
Mikita Brottman, who lived in the hotel at the time of Rey's death, wrote a book about this case. According to her, multiple people there had heard a loud ""bang"" sound on the night of his death, despite reports saying no one heard anything. After his death, she tried multiple times to access the roof area, and only on one occasion was the door locked. Furthermore, a physicist determined that, if he was running at eleven miles per hour, he could have jumped from the roof and landed in the spot where his body was found.

I'm back again with another benign mystery. I worked on and off on this for quite a while and found the research really interesting.

As always here is [THE VIDEO VERSION](https://youtu.be/9Hcqoo7DIEo) for those who prefer it. I always try to make these with as little fluff as possible.

# The biggest secret in art history

Imagine, if you will, you are a town-dwelling early 17th century European. Throughout your lifetime you have been exposed to wonderfully crafted paintings in what would be known as the baroque period.

As you leave the local tavern, walking the cobblestone paved streets home, perhaps familiar with locally renowned painters like Rembrandt, el Greco and Breughel, you catch a glimpse of something strange.

You spot a painting, not just any painting. [A piece of art unlike anything you've ever seen before](https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2020/08/Johannes_Vermeer_-_Girl_Reading_a_Letter_by_an_Open_Window_-_Google_Art_Project-783x1024.jpg).

An indoor scene, details exquisitely placed, natural lightning that mimics the sun peering through your own windows. Truly a portal in to someone's life that seems indistinguishable from real life, as if a photograph taken centuries before the invention of the modern camera.

***NOT JUST AN INTERPRETATION***

In the 17th century, during what would be known as the Baroque period, important themes in art were emotional states, often dramatic and exaggerated. A sense of grandeur, drama, vitality and extreme movements. Paintings in a baroque style, as the word itself implies, did not ascribe to the regular or immaculate but would rather try to illicit an emotional response.

However, at around 1650 something changed. Some artists, mainly situated in the Netherlands almost overnight learned how to paint with the most exquisite of detail and perfect lighting, as if they had sold their soul to the devil in exchange for unprecedented artistry.

Perhaps the most famous of those artists was [Johannes Vermeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer). When I say famous in regards to Vermeer, I am actually referring to his paintings, not the man himself.

In fact, very little is known about this illustrious artist. His exact date of birth is unknown. As is the fact in how he gained his amazing painting skills. 

In the 1600s in Holland, it was customary as an artist to train under masters. Which master you trained under could lend credence to your own skill and thus increase notoriety as an artist. Therefore a lot of records about artists of that time had been preserved. This is not the case for Johannes Vermeer.

In modern days, somewhere between 35 and 40 paintings of his hand survived. Each one still displaying an uncanny sense of realism, as if painted with light itself.

But what exactly caused such a drastic shift in painting accuracy? Making paintings look more and more lifelike..

***TECHNOLOGY AND ART MEET***

What if painters like Johannes Vermeer and his contemporaries actually used technology to create their photo-realistic artworks?

The 17th century in Holland was known as the Golden Age and for good reason! International shipping trade and rapid advances in quality of life, made for a fertile breeding ground of technological advances.

One of the trades Holland was best known was its extraordinary lens crafting. Advances in lens grinding made these lenses arguably the best of their time.

So could it be possible that Vermeer and painters like him were aided by devices that included these masterfully crafted lenses?

In the book Vermeer's Camera, author Philip Steadman proposes exactly this. He says that it  could be possible these artists used some form of the camera obscura to capture images and trace over them.

However, when examining [Vermeer's paintings under an x-ray machine](https://countingvermeer.rkdstudies.nl/2-the-use-of-x-radiographs-in-the-study-of-paintings/25-x-rays-and-vermeers-painting-technique/), no sign of drawings or tracings of any kind were found. It seemed as if he had just walked up to a canvas and started painting free-hand.

***ENTER STAGE LEFT***

In 2013 famous Vegas stage magicians Penn &amp; Teller teamed up with Penn's long time friend Tim Jenison to make a documentary.

Tim is a business man and inventor, who developed an interest in Dutch golden age paintings and painters. After reading 'Vermeer's Camera', he decided to find out if it was possible the old masters used some form of technology, some kind of invention maybe, to help create their masterpieces. The film follows Tim as he explains how a simple mirror on a stick can reproduce very realistic works of art, with little to no experience in painting. By placing a mirror at a certain angle, one could line up a picture with a canvas and by moving the head up and down, constantly comparing colors, a match could be found by trial and error. A very lifelike picture starts emerging.

Throughout the documentary, Tim, through experimentation, further develops his aptly named ""[comparator mirror](https://www.easy-oil-painting-techniques.org/images/using-a-comparator-mirror-rose-painting-900px.jpg)"". He then decides to take on the huge challenge of trying to recreate a Vermeer painting. On top of that he sets for himself the challenge of only using materials and techniques that were available in Vermeer's time. 

This includes but is not limited to: lens crafting, table making, façade building and pigment mixing.

After 100s of days Tim Jenison finally finishes [his masterwork](https://media2.fdncms.com/sevendaysvt/imager/tims-vermeer/u/original/2333533/moviereview1-1.jpg). He shows it to a pair of art critics and it is lauded as being of equal quality to the original Vermeer, thus seemingly proving the comparator mirror could have been used by the Dutch golden age masters.

***SMOKE &amp; MIRRORS***

While Tim's Vermeer puts forward some compelling evidence in favor of the use of something like a comparator mirror by certain Golden age painters, the fact that the documentary is made by two famous tricksters might warrant some healthy skepticism.

In his blog, writer Joshua Gans created an article titled ""[10 reasons to Doubt Tim's Vermeer](https://joshgans.medium.com/10-reasons-to-doubt-tims-vermeer-c183bb3ce7a2)"". 

In it he cites several reasons as to why he suspects Tim's Vermeer is actually a hoax documentary. It's definitely worth a read and contains some compelling yet circumstantial evidence pointing towards it being fake.  It should be noted though that Pen Gillette has disputed these claims in a podcast and insists the documentary is genuine. Since Tim's Vermeer was produced several years ago as of writing this, it would have to be a véry long con.

It might still not be so far fetched that some kind of invention or secret technique was used in the past. There exist a lot of records of tutelage of painters and providence of certain works of art but the exact painting methods and things like how to mix the perfect pigment, was often a very closely guarded secret. It would be no surprise that such records be either lost to time or purposefully suppressed.

Maybe one day Penn &amp; Teller will come forward and claim their documentary as an elaborate misdirection or maybe some long lost texts will be found, lending credence to the theory of something like the comparator mirror.

Until then, whether or not the Dutch Golden age masters actually did use technology to aid them in the creation of their lifelike masterworks, will remain simply a mystery..

507,JoyIkl,1640163694,"No family, no home, Nguyen Thanh An - the son of a victim in a murder case has been living off whatever he job he can get while trying to find the one who murdered his mother more than 40 years ago.

**The case**

1980, Binh Dinh, Vietnam

When his mother - Phan Thi Khanh - 26 years old was murdered, Do Thanh An was only 7 years old. After the death of her husband shortly after An’s birth, she took An to Binh Dinh to live with her mother. “My mother was a hard working woman, he worked the field in whole day and she even worked at home till midnight” - Mr. An remembers.

“Our house was made of coconut leaves. There was this one time the house burned down. My mom had to dig through the still warm ash to find the gold that she hid under the bed. I remember there were a broken golden bracelet that my mom cut up to give a piece to my uncle when he got married, a few rings and a necklace. After the fire, my mom sewed a small pouch to hold what little gold she had left, she would always wear in front of the chest” - Mr. An says.

On the afternoon of the 31st of July 1980, An was waiting for his mom to haul the last load of corn from the field. However, she never came home. At around 7pm, he heard a neighbor yelled: “Your mom is dead, An!”. Those words would continue to haunt the boy for the rest of his life. When the police arrived, they found that Ms. Khanh was dead, killed by multiple stabs to the head, face and arm. The pouch with the gold was ripped apart and of course, the 2 ounces of gold was missing.

**The innocent suspect?**

Mr. Vo Te was a local physician who went to scene of the crime because he heard a person was sick. 1st August 1980, the police prosecuted Mr. Vo te on charges of “murder and theft”. However, after 5 months of investigation, Mr. Vo Te guilt was not proven so he was released. Due his status as a murder suspect, his family and neighbors shunned him up until his death in 1994. Later his son submitted a petition to the authorities asking them to terminate his father status as a suspect and give him back his dignity and honor.

**The real killer?**

Mr. Truong Dinh Chi was the brother in law of Ms. Khanh’s brother. He and his wife was staying at Ms. Khanh’s brother’s house. They had no money, only 30 kg of fertilizer. On the afternoon of Ms. Khanh’s murder, nobody saw Mr. Chi. Two days after the murder, he and his wife said that they were going to Cam Ranh to sell the fertilizer to pay off their son medical bill.

However, they did not go to Cam Ranh but went back to their home town and stayed in a small abandoned house next to the house of an unnamed witness. The witness said that he saw light coming out the house at midnight, curious, he peeked through the wall made of leaves of the house and saw Mr. Chi and his wife counting their money with two golden rings and a broken golden bracelet on the table.

After a short while, the couple bought a boat for 1400 VND. At the time, this was a huge sum of money which surprised a lot of people because a little while ago, the couple didn’t even have enough money pay their son medical bill.

An investigator who worked on the case shared that: “In 1981, I was working the local police to register the people who will be leaving the province. That day, Mr. Chi and his wife went to submit their ID. According to procedures, the police would keep their ID and return it to them the next day. However, Mr. Chi and his wife never came back for their ID and disappeared during the night. Perhaps he recognized me as one of the crime scene investigators and who took the testimonies of the neighbors. Mr. Vo Te’s testimony was true, there is only one suspect left - Truong Dinh Chi.”

**The rough childhood**

When his mother died, An was still small, his grandmother was too old to take care of him. An’s uncle moved in with his grandmother. “My mom died. I was an orphan. He would beat me so frequently that a neighbor took pity on me, went and got my paternal grandparents to take care of me instead”.

Barely 10 year old, An left his home to move to his paternal grandparent house. But they were also old so An never got the chance to go to school. Occasionally, An would visit his old house and the neighbors would talk about the murder. 

**The quest for the killer**

It has been 40 years since the murder but the police has not found the killer despite multiple denunciations from surrounding neighbors. In 1986, knowing that Mr. Vo Te was innocent, An visited the neighbors who submitted the denunciation letter to gather information and decided to track down the killer himself.

In 1990, An submitted to the police a denunciation letter. The suspect was Truong Trinh Chi (aka Truong Dinh Khoi), however, his whereabouts were unknown. A while later, An discovered that Chi had moved to his wife’s home town and changed his name to Le Minh Son. An immediately filed a denunciation letter to the police. The police determined that Le Minh Son was indeed Truong Dinh Chi, however, the suspect and his wife suddenly disappeared 

To search for his mother’s killer, An did not settle down. “ I have been living on the road for years, I would follow clues about the killer wherever they lead. Of course, no one would want to marry a vagabond like me” - Mr. An shares. He works wherever he can, from selling lottery tickets, working as a construction worker, dish washer… and quits his job to move to another place if there was a lead on the killer. “I work where I can, rent a room where I can so i can send and receive letters. For 40 years, every month, I would send a letter to the state authorities to remind them that my mother was killed in 1980 and till this day, the killer has not been found”.

An sent letters to multiple agencies from local to central government. He even sent letters to the head of the Party, head of State and the National Assembly. Anywhere he could think up that might help him in his search for the killer. But every time, the reply was the same: “please direct your petition to the local police”.

In 2017, Mr. An went the police again to send his denunciation letter. He provided testimonies and information he had gathered but the case went cold shortly after.

According to Vietnamese Criminal Code, the highest statue of limitation for criminal charges is 20 years. So it is unlikely that the police will ever properly investigate the case again and unfortunately, Mr. An might never get the closure he spent his entire life looking for.

“All I want is to know if Mr. Truong Dinh Chi killed my mother? I just need a concrete answer from the police. Every time I think of the untimely death of my mother, I can’s help but cry”.

508,B1Baker,1640140843,"December 20th, 12:30 pm, 2008.

Sanibel Island, Florida.

A horrifying discovery is made.

Sharon Michie went outside to check the mail.  What she found instead was a shocking revelation.  Elf-Mingo, a 20 inch tall, black eyed flamingo with a pink body, was nowhere to be seen.  The only thing left of him were his legs, still intact in the ground.  He was last seen wearing a 

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sharon went inside &amp; shrieked to her mother in utter terror, ""Someone Has Stolen Elf-Mingo!"".

The police were called.

When asked when the flamingo was abducted, Elf-Mingo was last seen at 10:30 pm last night, meaning this was likely an abduction in broad daylight.  

Missing flamingo posters were put up, exclaiming ""Elf-Mingo is Helpless without his Legs!"".  The posters were of no use though, as nobody had found Elf-Mingo yet.  

Understanding the direness of the situation, Judy Michie tested a theory of her own.  She suspected that a tourist had taken Elf-Mingo.  His legs were missing, so Judy Michie came to the conclusion that the legs must have been left there so Elf-Mingo could be smuggled through airport security.  

Believing that the time for finding Elf-Mingo was running low, Judy Michie took matters into her own hands &amp; asked tourists to keep their eyes out for the plastic flamingo.  

Before I continue on with the story, I would like to tell a bit about Elf-Mingo's life first.  Elf-Mingo was a family man.  His family included 8 little rein-mingos, Two Elf-Mingos, &amp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Santa-Mingo.  They were put outside for the previous two years for Christmas, Halloween, &amp; Thanksgiving.  

Now back to the story,

Beginning to lose all hope, the Michie family thought of ways they could prevent this from happening again in the future.  They ran through several ideas such as putting GPS trackers on the lawn birds.  They also bound all of the birds together with fishing line to make it more difficult to abduct a bird.

But then the unexpected happened, a Christmas miracle.

Sharon Michie, still distraught over Elf-Mingo's disappearance, walked to a party in a direction she didn't regularly travel.  

It was while she was walking there that she spotted Elf-Mingo, in front of the Greenhouse Grill.

She checked the belly of the flamingo &amp; found his tattoo, stating his name.  Without any doubt, this was Elf-Mingo.

Diane from Greenhouse Grill was credited for rescuing Elf-Mingo.  She had found him face down in a gully.  Not aware of the Elf-Mingo tragedy, she took him &amp; placed him in front of the restaurant.

The police were called &amp; the case was closed.

However, there is still a question left unanswered.  How did Elf-Mingo end up in the gully?  Was it a tourist like Judy Michie had suspected?  Or perhaps an animal?  Or maybe none of the above.  Foul play is still suspected in the case, it is thought that someone threw the plastic flamingo into the gully, but who? What reason would someone have to steal the flamingo only to throw it in a gully just a few minutes away? What is your theory on how this happened?

509,funeralposts,1640138221,"If you lived in a town of around 186 people that only measured around 0.26 square miles, where would you hide a body? In the town of Worthville, Kentucky, the answer might be “underneath an abandoned trailer.”

Underneath an abandoned trailer is exactly where a rottweiler named Rocks had dug up a human jaw and brought it back to his owner, Tammy Sculley, in the May of 2018. According to Sculley, when she took the jaw (that she assumed at the time to be fake), Rocks then brought her another jaw and part of a skull. Sculley would later state that she planned on cleaning these and placing them in her fish tank as decorations, as she had immediately believed they were fake. 

It’s not known whether or not Sculley herself chose to bring the remains to the police or if someone living with Sculley had advised her to, but Sculley brought the remains to the office of the Carroll County police. It would turn out that Sculley would have to buy new decorations for the fish tank, because the Carroll County coroner told Sculley that the remains were, in fact, human.

The small town and Sculley would find themselves in the midst of a media frenzy. It’s not hard to see why – in a town of fewer than 200 people, a dog brings his owner bones found underneath a trailer that had been abandoned following a fire five years prior? It’s a story that would seem the premise of a crime novel. A resident of the town would state that it “just don’t seem right.”

Every update seemed just to make the story more confusing. Cadaver dogs and K-9’s found no other traces of human remains in the area. None of the graves in the nearby graveyard were found to be disturbed. The only nearby missing persons case was too recent to match the remains. The trailer was towed and the land beneath it was searched to no avail. Everyone had questions, but no one had answers. 

There would, however, be an answer to one question. ""How is it that no other remains were discovered under or around the trailer?"" 

No remains were ever found beneath the trailer. Rocks never dug up any bones. In fact, Rocks wasn’t involved at all. 

In June of 2018, Sculley was arrested for falsely reporting an incident to the police. Sculley had fabricated the entire story about Rocks bringing her the remains after digging under the trailer, it would be revealed. According to Sheriff Phillip Marshall of Carroll County, the human remains were “artifacts” that had been stolen from a collector. 

However, Sculley was not believed to be the thief. The thieves are believed to be two burglary suspects (who have, to my knowledge, remained unnamed as they’re believed to be linked to many burglaries) who had stolen them from a storage container and then given them to Sculley. The reasoning for the remains being given to Sculley is believed to be simply to hide them, though it’s widely agreed upon that they were, in fact, meant to be decorations for a fish tank. 

Sculley worried about holding onto these remains and prepared to turn them over to the police. Before she did, however, Sculley feared that she would be implicated in the burglary. To avoid this, Sculley decided to fabricate a story about Rocks digging up the remains underneath the abandoned trailer. Of course, this fabrication had enough holes in it to look like the land that Rocks had dug up.

Marshall stated that there’s no indication of foul play relating to the remains and has not formally labeled them as John Does due to them being artifacts. However, the remains still went under laboratory testing. All three skeletal remains were determined to have likely been of European ancestry, and both jaws are likely from males. 

It seems, however, that that’s all the answers that we’ve been given. There are still many things that remain unknown. Who stole the remains, and how did they know Sculley? How old are these remains? What makes these remains “artifacts,” and how did the collector obtain them? Who do these remains belong to?

Despite being perhaps the most important question, the identity of the remains may never find an answer.

511,Bunnystrawbery,1640133165,"Kelly was last seen at approximately 8:30 p.m. in Gilmer, Texas on January 5, 1992. She was leaving her place of employment, Northeast Texas Video on Buffalo Street, and heading to the bank around the corner to make her usual night deposit. The bank's security cameras showed that an individual did make the night deposit, but it is unclear whether or not the person was Kelly. She has never been heard from again.

Kelly's car was discovered later in the evening in her employer's parking lot. One of the vehicle's tires had been slashed. The other three tires were intact. All of Kelly's personal belongings, including her purse, were inside the car, but her keys were missing.

A grand jury indicted Gilmer Police Department sergeant James York Brown and seven others on charges of Kelly's abduction and presumed murder in January 1994, two years after Kelly disappeared.

Prosecutors believed that Brown, who had been assigned to investigate Kelly's case, was involved with the seven other individuals with kidnapping and imprisoning Kelly for over one week. The state also contended that they sexually assaulted, and tortured Kelly while she was held captive, then stabbed her to death.

It was alleged that the group was part of a satanic cult and engaged in violent acts, including child molestation, as part of their cult rituals. Many of the defendants charged with Kelly's murder were also charged with sexually abusing children.

The murder charges against everyone were later dropped, two months after the initial allegations had been made. One suspect, a teenager named Michael Biby, was convicted of a misdemeanor for slashing Kelly's car tire. He admitted to the crime, but maintains he knows nothing about Kelly's disappearance and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The ""satanic cult"" was found to be nonexistent, a fantasy concocted by overzealous investigators. Brown and the other defendants maintained their innocence in Kelly's case from the onset of the investigation.

Kelly was dating Chris Denton at the time of her disappearance. He reportedly had a hot temper and police investigated him for possible involvement in her case, but found no evidence to implicate him. He died of cancer in 2004 and there were rumors he had made a deathbed confession regarding her case, but the stories were untrue; Denton maintained his innocence until the end.

Joe David Henry, the owner of Northeast Texas Video and the last person to see Kelly before she vanished, was arrested on child pornography charges in 2004. Authorities have emphasized that in spite of the nature of the charges against him, he has never been considered a serious suspect in Kelly's case.

Kelly was a student at Gilmer High School in 1992. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Foul play is suspected.

513,areaunknown_,1640125496,"Quick background for those not familiar with the case- Sierra Lamar was a 15 year old girl from Morgan Hill, California . On March 16 2012 she disappeared during her walk to her bus stop. A few days later, on March 18, her purse was found in a rural part of town with her clothes neatly folded on top. Her jeans had a semen stain that DNA found belonged to a man named Antolin Garcia-Torres. He was eventually found guilty of murdering Sierra even though her body was never recovered. My question is what do you guys think happened to her body? I feel like her body HAS to be out there somewhere. I remember watching See No Evil on ID and detectives found that Antolin left his house before sierra even left to go to the bus and didn’t come home until 4-6 hours later (I can’t remember the time frame). 

So many unidentified bodies are found everyday I just happens to hope that hers is recovered. It broke my heart when her family said they won’t hold a funeral because it doesn’t seem right to without a body to lay to rest.

516,TheGreenListener,1640114064,"On New Year’s Day 1970, Geraldine Settee--described as smart, responsible and a lover of pranks and music--was an eleven-year-old girl living in St. Vital, then part of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. At this time, St. Vital was described as a “safe neighbourhood.”

Geraldine was the youngest of ten siblings, not all living at home, and was Métis, meaning her family was of mixed Indigenous and European descent. Geraldine’s family had moved from the Métis community of Matheson Island to St. Vital in 1962, when Geraldine was four years old. The Métis have a long history in Manitoba and in the Winnipeg area, and even today, Winnipeg boasts the largest population of Métis inhabitants per capita in Canada. 

According to Geraldine’s profile on the CBC’s site for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, at 8:00 PM on January 1, 1970, she wanted to go to a nearby drugstore to buy chips and pop. That same profile says “According to media reports, it was still daylight” so Geraldine’s father Leonard, who died in 1972, allowed her to go alone. Other sources claim that sunset was at 4:38 PM that day. I live in another part of Canada, and that would seem much more likely to me, given the latitude and the time of year. Regardless, Geraldine went to the store, approximately an eight-minute walk away, taking $1.30 in coins and a transistor radio her father had given her for Christmas.  

After twenty-five minutes, Leonard began to worry about Geraldine. He and another of his daughters went looking for her, and determined the corner store was closed. The next morning, one of Geraldine’s sisters and brothers-in-law found her fully clothed body near Fermor Avenue, approximately 13 kilometres from their home, in an empty lot. She had been stabbed six times in the back and chest with a knife 15 to 18 centimetres long and 2 centimetres wide. She had not been sexually assaulted. The MMIW profile says robbery was not a motive as Geraldine still had her money, although it makes no mention of the transistor radio. 

According to Geraldine’s brother Glen, who was seventeen at the time of her murder, the St. Vital police who initially handled the case were never forthcoming about the investigation. He told a CBC report, “We heard nothing from the police or the justice department. Anything I heard was from schoolmates at Glenlawn Collegiate or their siblings in Windsor School, and it was all rumours about one person…who was a knife freak.” Geraldine’s family also learned that two teenagers in the area had been threatened by a boy with a knife the week prior to Geraldine’s murder. 

The MMIW profile says that at the time of Geraldine’s death, a 14-year-old was interrogated but released due to lack of evidence. A more recent CBC article on the case says a 16-year-old was charged two years after the murder, but “there was not sufficient evidence to support the Crown proceeding with charges.” The Winnipeg police, which is now handling the still-open case, says they have kept the family informed.  

Interestingly, Leonard Settee told reporters that on December 5, 1969, Geraldine received a threatening phone call. He didn’t specify what the threats were, but said that she was so frightened by this phone call that she fainted the next time the phone rang. I looked for more information in this, but couldn't find any. 

While this is a case in which the likely murderer seems known to police, it remains officially unsolved, and the family continues to be without answers. Sadly, this is not an uncommon occurrence when it comes to the murders of Indigenous women and girls in Canada. I do, however, wonder about the phone call. Was it intended for Geraldine, or did she just happen to pick up? It seems from Glen's quote that her siblings were not personally acquainted with this ""knife freak"", but did he know them? Was the radio found with her? Was it just a motiveless crime of opportunity? And what of the apparently strange claim that it was still light at 8:00 PM in Manitoba in January?

Although he never met her, Geraldine's nephew Ryan Settee is trying to bring attention to the case and the way in which it was handled. He says he has attempted to contact the Winnipeg Police Service, the Crown and Manitoba Justice Minister Cameron Friesen but has received no direct reply. The Minister did email a statement to the CBC, which said ""The 1970 murder of Geraldine Settee is a tragedy, and the family carries the additional burden that the case remains unsolved 51 years later"" and he encouraged the family to reach out to the Manitoba Family Information Liaison Unit.

519,hellonurseb,1640113114,"On September 18th, 1995, the Bensalem Police Department found the skeletal remains of an adult in a wooded area behind the Club House Diner on Street Rd.  The victim was unclothed and wrapped in a plastic tarp. Autopsy information determined that the victim was an adult white female between the ages of 35 to 45 years old and that she had given birth at least once. She was approximately 4’8’ to 5’2” tall and had brown hair. The death was classified as a homicide by unspecified means and it was estimated that the body had been there for two to three years.  Some articles of clothing were found near the body may have possibly belonged to the victim. A blue quilted sleeveless vest, a pink t-shirt with “KPMG Peat Marwick”, and a white t-shirt with “Property of Alcatraz Penitentiary Swim Team, San Francisco”. Additional items found were a brown beaded seat cushion (possibly used in an automobile) and two crucifixes, one gold and one silver. Despite considerable media coverage, the decedent was never identified and there were no missing person reports that matched her. She was buried in Telford, PA under the name Jane Doe. In May of 2004, Bensalem Police exhumed her remains and sent them to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification where a DNA profile was extracted and uploaded into the CODIS system in an attempt to identify her. Additionally, the DOE Network assisted by providing a forensic sketch and sculpture to show what the decedent looked like in life. Over 50 missing women were excluded as being Jane Doe between 2004 and 2021. In November of 2021, BODE labs developed a DNA profile for this Jane Doe and uploaded it into GEDmatch and FamilytreeDNA.com.  Jennifer Moore, of Innovative Forensic Investigations, assisted Police by conducting genealogy research which led to the identification of Jane Doe. With additional sibling DNA comparison testing, the Bensalem Twp. Police Dept. is confident that Jane Doe has been identified as Merrybeth Hodgkinson of Warminster, PA. Merrybeth vanished sometime in September of 1992 after visiting with her family in Warminster, PA.  Merrybeth was approximately 31 years old when she died and worked as an exotic dancer in the Lower Bucks County area. The investigation has shown that she also resided at 719 Rhawn St. Phila, PA, the George Washington Motor Lodge, and the Oakford Inn.

Curious to see if this does get linked back to William David Montgomery:

Hodgkinson's death falls within the same time frame as a nearly identical 1992 murder in Bensalem. 

Toshiko Ciaccio, 42, a Japanese immigrant and exotic dancer, was found naked and wrapped in clear plastic and carpet near the development where she lived on Sept. 27, 1992. She had been bludgeoned and strangled, police said.

Bensalem resident William “Wild Bill” Montgomery was arrested in 1994 for the murder of Ciaccio and Philadelphia resident Amy Moore, 25, whose beaten body was found wrapped in a camper awning near the Delaware River in August, 1993.

In 2001, Montgomery pleaded guilty to both murders and he was sentenced to two life sentences, which he is serving at the State Correctional Institute in Somerset County, about 75 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.

McMullin said he suspects that Montgomery may have information related to Hodgkinson’s death. 

""I'm very confident,"" he said in an interview.

521,moondog151,1640106055,"Lake Rweru is a shallow lake 100 km2 in Africa dissected by the border between the countries of Burundi and Rwanda. From the lake flows The Kagera River from Rwanda. 

Starting in mid-July, 2014 fishermen in Northern Burundi who lived by Lake Rweru would discover several male corpses all of which in various states of decomposition and wrapped in white plastic bags floating on the surface of the lake. As the fishermen depend on the lake for their livelihood the discovery of the bodies caused panic due to the health concerns associated with bodies decomposing in their lake. 

The Burundian police collected the bodies and started to investigate however they would keep appearing with all of them being wrapped in white plastic with one exception the body of a naked woman was found decomposed in the same lake. On August 19 two bodies would be found and from August 24 - 25 5 corpses would be found. By the end of August alone a total of at least 40 corpses were recovered from the lake. None of the bodies were identified and no cause of death or how long they were in the lake has ever been determined but given the circumstances of their discovery foul play is very likely.        

During initial investigations Burundian officials determined that the bodies were not Burundian and that they were actually Rwandan nationals carried into the Burundian half of the lake by The Kagera River and because they assumed that they were Rwanda's citizens and that they likely died in Rwanda, Burundi claimed that the investigation was Rwanda's responsibility. However in response Rwanda report that no one on the Rwandan side of the lake had been reported missing and that since the bodies were discovered in Burundi that this matter was their responsibility to resolve. Burundi likewise claimed that no one on their side went missing  and both countries denied that these unidentified bodies belonged to their citizens.     

International pressure was put on both countries to conduct a joint and transparent investigation into the country but they both seemed keen on trying to dump responsibility onto each other. Rwandan police questioned villagers and fishermen living on the Rwandan side of the lake and they stated that they never saw any bodies wrapped in plastic floating on the lake at all let alone their side which Rwanda used as further evidence that Burundi had to look into the case. Some villagers however claimed that they were instructed not to speak to Burundian journalist however the Rwandan authorities deny these claims.  During March - June, 2014 there were reports of mass enforced disappearances in Rwanda but this was denied, Some of the alleged disappeared people reappeared but others remained missing. Some think that the bodies were disposed of in Rwandan marshland and that they only ended up in Burundi's portion of the lake after The Kagera River's flow had changed that year. And despite their governments claims even Rwandan villagers believe that the bodies flowed into Burundi from The Kagera River in their own country as they talked to Burundian journalist under anonymity and stated that they did see white plastic bags flowing down the river towards Burundi and that someone opened it to find a corpse that was bound by rope. The villagers didn't want to get in trouble with the authorities though so they didn't report the find. Many opposition parties and politicians in Rwanda demanded that their country conduct an investigation as well

 Burundi however is also no stranger to human rights violations with enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings being commonplace in the nation. And curiously the bodies were buried on the Burundian side very quickly after discovery before identification efforts could commence however the Burundian Authorities defended this act by stating that it was a matter of public health due to the heavy decomposition, Officials in the villages and region where the bodies were found also stated that they didn't have the technical means and resources to conduct autopsies or identification efforts on them. Some theorize though that the reason both countries are hesitant to investigate is less about wanting to pass responsibility onto the other but more about not wanting to strain the relations between each other which one Burundian politician described as being in ""Good shape"" 

The bodies continued to be discovered in September with two more bodies found in similar conditions at the beginning of the month. Four of the bodies recovered were buried in Kwidagaza village and in a surprising twist on September 21 - 22 a group of people would get in a boat and travel into Burundi docking at the village under the cover of night and making their way to the grave sites of the four bodies. A villager however scared them off and making his presence known causing the group of man to flee and board their boat to sail back to where they came. The Burundian police were informed of this and they discovered a shovel and a plastic tarpaulin which they believed would've been used to transport the corpses. Many accused these men of being Rwandan Marines and the fact that the group of men sailed into the country from Rwanda to secretly exhume the bodies and bring them back to Rwanda it reignited the controversy especially with their denial of having any involvement although a Rwandan official (unnamed) stated that this attempted grave robbery was ""Manipulation which aims to harm his country"" The Burundi army were then deployed to the village to guard the bodies after this.     

After months of pressure from NGOs, Human Rights Organizations, The United States and the European Union (both of which supply aid to Burundi and Rwanda) for both countries to investigate the bodies the Burundi authorities finally accepted an offer from the FBI to assist in the investigation and identification of the bodies however any information on the FBI's investigation seems to be unknown. 

The case would take another strange turn as on October 30, two more corpses one of which tragically being that of a child would be discovered on the Burundian side of the lake wrapped in plastic. The discovery was made by a fisherman however when the police arrived they ordered him and the rest of the villagers to just ignore and to not report any further bodies they may find with the police in the area simply stating they were following orders given from above. It is because of this that news slowed. On December 16, the two countries finally accepted an offer to conduct a joint investigation led by the African Union with forensic assistance from NGO organizations and other countries (Which Burundi requested themselves.) however there seemed to be no follow ups on this joint investigation headed by the African Union for a while.

In March, 2015 a retired Rwandan army captain named David Kabuye was put on trial for illegal possession of a firearm Incitement to cause uprising and defamation. However David also stated that the bodies found in Lake Rweru were from those kidnapped in Rwanda and even Uganda. He was acquitted later that year.

The hopes for a joint investigation would sadly be crushed as in 2015 during Burundi's political crisis relations between the two countries would severely deteriorate and at this same lake during 2015 - 2016 some Burundians would be shot dead by Rwandan soldiers trying to illegally enter the country while Burundi accused Rwanda of kidnapping Burundian fishermen and on July 31, 2017 three unidentified corpses would be found in a river bordering the two nations. 

The most recent news comes from 2019 when bodies started to be found in the lake again when on February 28, 2019 the unidentified and decomposing bodies of both a man and women would be found on the Burundian side of the lake which caused great concern as many of the residents still remembered the 40 - 50 corpses discovered at their lake in 2014. On November 11, 2019 a decomposing body was discovered in the and the next day on November 12 the bodies of a man estimated to be in his 30s and an infant were both discovered in the lake decomposed. They have never been identified but the Burundian police examined the bodies and determined that they were homicide victims. 

Sadly that is the last piece of information none of the burning questions such as the identities of the victims, how they died and if they were killed by who and why. 

However there is another theory that has been put forward. It's been suggested that the bodies are not Burundian or Rwandan but rather Congolese. The Imbonerakure are a Burundian political youth and opposition movement however they have been accused by many to carry out arbitrary arrests, torture and extrajudicial killings on the behalf of former Burundian president Pierre Nkurunziza. The Imbonerakure have been known to enter into the Eastern portion of The Democratic Republic of Congo where they receive support from some Burundian diaspora and Congolese of the same ethnic group and tribes. However as a result of this they have been accused of contributing to the social unrest that has been plaguing the DRC and that some Congolese are members of The Imbonerakure.

During 2014 there was infight and rebellion from The Imbonerakure and their Congolese allies the Banyamulenge over not being paid but therformore when ever their allies the Banyamulenge (I should point out that they are not an organization but an ethnic group. This does not apply to all of them) got paid but sent their money to their tribal chiefs and themselves and also refused to assist Imbonerakure in their missions. Eventually a massacre took place resulting in the deaths of 47 with 37 victims being Banyamulenge and 10 Burundian. Four escaped but were caught and sentenced to a Burundian prison. The theory goes that the victims of this massacre were smuggled out of the DRC and dumped into Lake Rweru in Burundi and that they dressed the bodies up to look like Rwandans to pin responsibility on them as it would be difficult to avoid raising suspicions amongst the Congolese is they buried them in a mass grave or dumped them in local rivers.

This theory however does have it's holes such as mainly a lack of evidence but also the behavior of the Rwandan authorities such as how they appeared to attempt to exhume the bodies and also Rwandan villagers reporting seeing bodies flowing towards Burundi from The Kegara River.     

This is a very strange case that is unlikely to ever be solved.

[Margaret “Mae” Sweet](https://uncovered.com/cases/margaret-sweet) was a young, lively woman—she [occasionally used the name Shelby Jamison](https://apps.colorado.gov/apps/coldcase/casedetail.html?id=4881)—-loved live music. A lover of the outdoors, her family described Margaret as having an adventurous spirit who felt most herself when she was white water rafting in the mountains. She was a reliable and thoughtful person who always made herself available for a friend in need. 

**A few months prior to her murder.** Margaret was living in Nashville, Tennessee when she met her boyfriend, Jere Dale Batts. Their relationship was often tumultuous despite Batts claims of never physically harming Margaret. On May 13, 2008, Margaret had filed an [order of protection against Batts](https://www.justiceformargaretsweet.com/news-stories/denver-post) after he had followed her across the country to Colorado Springs—on one occasion Batts left a teddy bear, a dozen red roses and engagement ring on her car.

**The day she was murdered.** On December 24, 2008, Margaret was home in Colorado Springs helping her father, James Egger, tend to her stepmother, Peggy who was recovering from surgery at a local hospital. Margaret and her father took turns visiting Penny. Around 11pm, neighbors overheard a loud verbal argument between an unidentified man and Margaret followed by a gunshot at her father’s home. 911 was never called. 

When Margaret’s father returned home the next day he noticed something on the white-picket fence. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was Margaret’s bloody body, with one leg in the basement well. She had been shot. When paramedics arrived on scene, Margaret was declared deceased. Investigators ran a ballistic report and found [the same gun was used to injure a man in a drug deal in 2007; the victim survived and no one was arrested](https://www.justiceformargaretsweet.com/news-stories/denver-post). However, toxicology reports would show that Margaret was sober at the time of her death and there is no connection to the drug trade. Jere Dale Batts would tell police that [he was on a date with another woman](https://www.justiceformargaretsweet.com/news-stories/denver-post) the time of the shooting. 

**Where the case stands today.** Margaret’s case remains unsolved, and there has been very little coverage of her case since her murder. Authories are asking anoyone with deatils about her murder to come forward. Were you near 1300 Forsdick Circle the evening of Christmas Eve 2008? .

Cynthia wheeler had - green eyes, short dark hair and a sincere smile, Cynthia was 24 at the of time of her tragic demise - she was attending a college (uncp) in the small town of Pembroke north Carolina where she was studying criminal justice and worked at a local Piggly wiggly , Cynthia was first reported missing by her roommates on June 23rd 1997, Cynthia was last seen at a friend's dorm, afterwards later that night Cynthia apparently went to meet with an acquaintance.

the community and town of Pembroke was devastated, family and friends of Cynthia's determined to help aid in finding her - distributed fliers while law enforcement conducted searches

three to five days later wheelers car (which I founded through research may have been a Isuzu) was found bullet riddled and burned in a field at 710 highway Robeson County.

four to five months after Cynthia was last seen on that faithful night - hunters found Cynthia's remains along with her fila sneakers in a wooded area near 710 highway in Robeson County NC not to far from where her car was found.

four months after Cynthia's remains was found, a suspect named - Dane Locklear jr  was charged with her murder but the charge was later dropped after a witness recanted his statement.

years came and years passed while Cythina's loved ones and the community of Pembroke waited for answers and justice - when finally in 2000 - Dane confessed to killing Cynthia while waiting trail for the murder of his girlfriend Frances Persad (I'll be making another post for France) Dane went on to tell law enforcement gruesome details about the killing of both women, a tape of the confession was later shown in the trail of Frances in which Dane was sentenced to death.

532,twobutcherbirds,1640020520,"[Joanna](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joan-queen-of-Castile-and-Aragon) was the third child of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, the medieval Spanish monarchs of Inquisition fame, whose union had united the separate Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon to form a dynastically unified Spain. Her siblings included two future queens of Portugal, as well as Catherine of Aragon, the future queen of England.

Raised in one of the most powerful families in Europe, Joanna was brought up to become an ideal future bride, as her title as princess meant she could be used to expand the power and influence of her family's kingdom. Like any other high-ranking medieval lady, she would have had a working knowledge of singing, dancing, languages, history, spelling and grammar, civil and canon law, hawking, riding, mathematics, philosophy, and needlework.

By around the age of fifteen, Joanna began to rebel against the strict Catholic doctrine her mother raised her with, refusing to attend confession and expressing 'heretical' views around Catholic rites and prayer. This expression was met with harsh punishment from her mother, whose devotion to the Catholic religion and hatred of heretics did lead to the execution of thousands of people. Mosen Luis Feffer, one of her father's chamber-men, wrote that Joanna had been punished for this behavior via ""la cuerda"", or 'the rope', where she had been suspended from the floor via a rope, with weights attached to her feet.

At sixteen she was betrothed to Philip of Flanders in an alliance set to strengthen the bond of Joanna's Trastámara and Philip's Habsburg families. Joanna left Spain to meet her husband in 1496 and the two were married later that year in what is now modern-day Brussels. Their union would produce six children, all of whom who grow up to be emperors or queens. Their relationship was one that waxed hot and cold, with the couple feuding over Phillip's infidelities and Joanna's jealous attempted to keep him from other women.

[Joanna's political fortunes changed with the deaths of her two older siblings and their children, which made Joanna the heir to her parent's kingdom](https://www.medievalists.net/2015/12/the-tragic-story-of-joanna-the-mad/). In 1502, Joanna was legally recognized as the heiress of the Castilian throne and named Princess of Asturias. When her mother died in 1504, Joanna became queen regent of Castile. This resulted in Ferdinand, her father, losing his monarchial rights to Castile. However, a clause in Isabella's will stated that Ferdinand could rule in Joanna's absence, or until her heir aged into the throne.

Ferdinand refused to accept this loss of authority and Phillip, Joanna's husband, refused to let his father-in-law take away his chance to control Castile. Both men minted coins with Joanna's name besides theirs, hoping to exercise their legal claims to the territory. Ferdinand also appealed to the same Castilian body that had named Joanna heir, claiming that her 'illness' would prevent her from governing, which resulted in him being appointed her legal guardian.

While Joanna and her husband feuded over how to handle her father's interference, Phillip decided to leave his kingdom and travel to Castile with Joanna in 1506. Ferdinand and Phillip met at Villafáfila in the summer of that year for a private meeting in a church, where Ferdinand swore to hand Castile over to Phillip and Joanna in a treaty. The pair also signed another, secret document, where they both vowed to prevent Joanna from being involved in government affairs, citing her ""infirmities and sufferings"". While Ferdinand attempted to weasel his way out of these treaties, he eventually abandoned Castile for Aragon, which allowed Phillip and Joanna to be declared King and Queen of Castile.

Only months later, Philip was dead of a sudden illness - either typhoid fever or, rumor has it, poison sent from his father-in-law. Joanna, pregnant with their sixth child and devastated at her husband's death, then attempted to rule Castile herself. Plague and famine overwhelmed her kingdom as she struggled to control her regency council and her subjects, who were on the edge of revolt. In the neighboring kingdom of Aragon, her father watched the chaos and bided his time. He returned to Castile in 1507, and when the plague and famine faded away shortly after his arrival, it seemed that Ferdinand had been sent by God to return Castile to health.

Father and daughter met that summer, with Ferdinand ordering Joanna to yield her royal titles to him. In the presence of three members of the royal council, allegedly summoned at Joanna's request, Ferdinand announced his new status as Joanna's regent. However, Joanna issued her own statement saying that he did not consent to the loss of her royal authority. Now queen only in name, Joanna was unable to stop Ferdinand from confining her inside the royal palace. Dismissing all her personal servants, Ferdinand had her surrounded by people loyal to himself. It was during this period that rumors of her madness began to spread, with some claiming that Joanna went into confinement with the exhumed body of Phillip to keep her company. Stories of her erratic behavior at this time aided her father's attempts to discredit her, as she alleged opened Phillip's coffin frequently to embrace the body, ordering that no women be allowed near the corpse.

At the death of Ferdinand in 1516, Joanna's eldest son Charles was named joint-heir of Castile and Aragon alongside his mother. The next year Charles arrived in Spain from Flanders to meet with his mother and accept his titles. After securing her consent for his rule, he continued her confinement within the royal palace, perhaps because some of the Castilian nobles still considered Joanna the true heir to the kingdom, as opposed to her foreign son. Charles, now Charles 1, was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, increasing his power and influence and antagonizing his Spanish enemies.

In 1520, a revolt attempted to overthrow Charles in the name of his mother, who was still legally his co-heir. The revolutionaries knew that if they could reach Joanna and get her consent to rebel, they would be legally allowed to overthrow the king. Charles' allies knew this as well, and arrived at the palace to advise Joanna to sign a document denouncing the rebellion. She refused, though when the rebels stormed the city and officially requested her support. While she refused to endorse the rebellion when asked, Charles realized that his mother would always be a threat to his right over Castile and ordered that Joanna remain in confinement for the rest of her life. As her time in isolation went on, Joanna's mental state began to decline. Convinced that the nuns caring for her actually wanted to kill her, she struggled to sleep, eat, or change her clothes. Allowed visits from her children, Joanna eventually became bedridden and died in 1555 at the age of 75.

Modern historians find the claims of madness aimed at Joanna to be someone suspicious, as she was known for her intelligence and resolve as a young woman - it was only after her marriage with Phillip that concerns around mental illness arose. Both her husband and her father had a lot of gain from removing her from the political picture, so having her declared mad would have been in both their interests. However, she had an allegedly extensive family history of mental illness, with her grandmother Isabella of Portugal, Queen of Castile also being considered mad.

So, what's your take? In my mind, it seems like a mix of both. An independent, headstrong woman mistreated by her family, Joanna might not have been mad when she was first imprisoned, but nearly a lifetime spent under those circumstances might have made her that way by the time she died.",UnresolvedMysteries,"Was Joanna of Castile and Aragon actually mad, or was she manipulated by her father, husband, and son?",0

536,Mr_Write_NEO,1640013654,"Aria left her young daughter, Maleigha, with family members before being dropped off at the Harem, about half an hour’s drive northeast of Eaton, Ohio, where she lived. Her last contact with family was a phone call to her mother later that night.

Aria worked at a few different gentleman’s clubs in the greater Dayton area in the months leading up to her death. She’d amassed a stable of regular clients, mostly lonely middle-aged men who weren’t above trading the occasional gift or fancy dinner for a few hours of companionship with a friendly, bubbly young girl. At least one of these regular customers dropped off the radar completely following Aria’s disappearance, according to her sister, only returning to the club months later — at which point he promptly began fixating on another dancer who physically resembled Aria.

Other persons of interest include friends who visited Aria at work: one, a female acquaintance with whom she often shared “boy drama,” was rumored to be in possession of some of the missing girl’s property; another, a male friend, is shockingly rumored to have “bragged” to mutual acquaintances about being present the night she died. When approached  with this information, however, police allegedly declined to investigate, calling the reports hearsay.

Managers at The Harem were equally unhelpful, refusing to provide security camera footage from the night Aria disappeared until long after the fact. The Harem would later be ordered closed following a raid in 2017 which resulted in nearly a dozen employees and patrons being charged with drug and prostitution-related offenses.

Aria’s body was found lying next to a fallen tree and partially covered with foliage in a wooded area inside Art Van Atta Park, less than two miles from the Harem, two months after her disappearance. There were reportedly no signs of trauma to Aria’s bones, according to medical examiners, and decomposition was too advanced for any wounds to be detected; ultimately no cause of death was able to be determined. 

Rumors of an accidental drug overdose and subsequent cover-up swirl around Aria’s case; she’d had run-ins with the law, as it turns out, and was in fact on probation at the time of her disappearance, having been ordered to pursue substance abuse treatment in lieu of conviction on charges of theft in  2011. 

Police have investigated several leads. Reports of a naked woman being chased by men in a van on Gettysburg Avenue – on the crime and poverty-stricken west side of Dayton – turned out to be unrelated, as DNA found on clothing left at the scene was not a match for Aria. The man who claimed to be present when Aria was killed, meanwhile, was discovered to have been in prison at the time. And the jewelry supposedly found in the possession of Aria’s female friend couldn’t be positively identified by family members.

Clothing and a VIP coupon from The Harem found in an abandoned factory in Dayton were revealed to have been there since long before Aria’s death. A man cleaning out an apartment where Aria had once lived in Trotwood found her social security card, but nothing came of that potential lead, either, and the man who found the card has reportedly been cooperative and forthcoming with investigators. Tips from jailhouse snitches have also failed to pan out.

Finally, surveillance video belatedly released by managers at The Harem shows Aria leaving the club and possibly being followed by a man in a cowboy hat. But that man was identified, according to police, and cell phone pings confirm he was in Columbus by the time Aria’s death is believed to have taken place.

546,rriolu372,1639939716,"For us trans and gender non-conforming people, each passing year is a double-edged sword. On one hand, support and acceptance are becoming more common among the population by year; on the other hand, more anti-trans bills are passed and more of us are killed for being who we are. Even before trans rights became such a massive topic at the forefront of America's politics today, trans people were still the victim of attacks. One unsolved death of a trans woman is the murder of Loni Kai Okaruru in Washington County, Oregon.

Loni is described as a Pacific Islander trans woman, who was 5'9"", about 130 pounds, and had long curly/wavy black hair with a reddish tint. Loni, who was 28 at the time of her death, was unemployed and living with her family in Aloha, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. According to articles, her family accepted her as a trans woman and she had lived as a girl for most of her life. Loni was originally from Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory, and had moved to the Portland area with her family at some point. Loni's identification identified her as a female, but still listed her under her birth name, Lorenzo, possibly due to the lack of legal recognition for trans people in the U.S. at the time.

On the day of her death in 2001, which various sources state as August 21st, 26th, or 29th, she had been seen twice before. At 2 AM, Loni had been seen talking with a woman at a 7/11 near Southwest TV Highway and Cornelius Pass Road, in Washington County. And at 3:30 AM, she was seen hitchhiking along the highway near Southwest Murray Boulevard. While she was walking along the highway, two Beaverton police officers who were passing by met her and conversed with her, and asked Loni if she needed help with something, which she declined. 

Only a few hours later at 8 AM, a jogger found Loni Kai's body in an overgrown field near the highway. She had been viciously beaten around the head with a metal object, and the cause of death was identified as blunt force trauma. Investigators quickly concluded that she was likely killed for being trans, due to her identity as well as the brutality of the attack. They also suggested that the murderer may have been accompanied by another person who was also complicit in Loni's murder and helped dump her body. However, despite the work of detectives, no suspect was found. In 2003, after receiving a tip from a prison inmate, an SUV that police believed might have been used to dump Loni's body in the field after her death was found; however, the tip was soon found to be false. No major breakthroughs have come in since then.

Loni Kai Okaruru was murdered for being trans, 20 years ago, and her case has gone cold. Even so, both police detectives and LGBT rights activists work to raise awareness of Loni and her death, and maintain hope of bringing her murderer to justice. In 2006, Murray Rau, a now-retired Hillsboro police detective who worked on Loni's case said, ""We never give up hope that these \[cases\] are going to be solved. We never forget about them.""

552,A_Wise_Mans_Fear,1639925444,"In 1994 a woman was brutally murdered, and two men were accused and sentenced to life sentences later that year. Normal stuff, right? WRONG. So frickin’ wrong. Recent evidence from an escaped convict about a potential corrupt (and guilty) detective is causing the whole thing to be revisited in the courts!

Let’s bundle up for a Buffalo winter and head to New York. 

# The Murdah 

In mid-February, 1993, a woman was murdered at 84 Franklin Street in Buffalo, New York. Most of the details from the crime come from the initial catalogue of evidence, via video, by a veteran police officer named David Bentley who “had a reputation for closing cases.” 

(Keep his name in mind. He’s actually a brand new suspect in the case as of this year…but more on that later.)

The camera, with his voice over, panned the home as he entered. There was blood spatter on the floor. Things were knocked off of shelves and cabinets. A trail of blood led to the kitchen which was also a mess of overturned furniture. 

A five-inch steak knife with a bloody handle was jammed inside the kitchen drawer. Blood was also found on a dog toy, a recipe book, and somehow…in a gravy boat. 

Deborah Meindls, a nursing student and mother of two children, lay lifeless on the ground. She was stabbed to death. Her hands were cuffed behind her back, and one of her husband’s ties was around her neck. 

It was quickly deemed a homicide.  

# The original investigation, suspects, and arrest

This case’s path twists and turns a lot, so I’m going to outline the first set of inconclusive evidence and then go into the two main suspects (one of whom was eventually arrested with an accomplice). 

Mind you, I’m not diving into the newest suspect, Officer Bentley, just yet. He comes later. (I see you salivating for that Bentley info, dear reader. Just sit tight, it’ll come!!)

**Initial evidence**:

A postal worker heard someone inside the house that day of the murder when they delivered the mail. They also noted that the dog who usually barks at the postal worker, was eerily silent

Footprints in the snow led to the back of the house where a small rectangular cut was noticed in the rear window, about 6 feet off the ground. Investigators determined later that the hole was cut from…the inside?

Some of these footprints were left by Lori Rank, the first officer at the scene who also happened to be Officer Bentley’s daughter…(damn it, I said LATER for the Bentley stuff!) 

Investigators determined that the crime was “probably too violent for a burglary gone wrong”

**Donald Meindl (it’s always the husband right?)**

Donald Meindl, 33 years old, was a manager at a Taco Bell at a local mall. He became the police’s number one suspect really quickly. Mr. Meindl had apparently confided in his friend that he’d thought about hiring someone to kill his wife (not a great look, man)....a point made even more ‘spicious by the fact that he had a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife!

&gt;“It should be made to look like a robbery,” the friend recalled Mr. Meindl saying, according to a police report cited by the defense.

(During the 1994 trial against Lorenz and Pugh, Mr. Meindl insisted it was just a joke. Because we all joke about that right? Right?!). 

This guy gets even worse than that though. The couple was apparently in an open marriage, so naturally Mr. Meindl (reminder, he’s 33 years old) was seeing 17-YEAR-OLD girl who worked for him at Taco Bell. He even kept photos of her, scantily clad, in his wallet, according to trial testimony. In the initial police report written during the initial investigation, Mr. Bentley noted handcuffs and other items found in the home that were used for “sexual bondage.”

Yikes. 

Yet, his innocence was maintained by the MOST ON-BRAND alibi for this guy: the day of the killing, he was at Taco Bell, getting fired after being accused of sexually harassing his staff.

**Lorenz and Pugh (sounds like a law firm, if only they had actually been lawyers they may have gotten off…)**

Enter James Pugh and Brian Scott Lorenz. 

A few days after the murder, a confidential informant (a friend of Pugh who also sort of knew Lorenz) told the police that Lorenz was the killer and he’d left Buffalo. 

The police found him in Iowa, where he was being jailed for stealing a car. 

Being, well, incredibly stupid, Lorenz was so desperate to get out of the Iowa jail and get back to New York that he decided to confess to the murder (despite apparently not having done it!). He even implicated Pugh (who he’d often burgled with, a great friend I’m sure) just to give the story some more credence. 

His “confession” was so littered with false details that it was deemed inadmissible at the 1994 trial. What’s more, there was ZERO physical evidence or signs of forced entry by either man.  

&gt;“This is not a case, ladies and gentlemen, involving a lot of forensic evidence,” one of the prosecutors told jurors. “We don’t have any fingerprints to put them there. We don’t have his blood or something to put him there. We don’t have his wallet at the scene. We don’t even have a witness to come in here and tell you, ‘I saw him there.’”

The case instead relied on a series of witnesses testifying that they HEARD the men TALKING about the crime. 

Yet, the two men were charged and convicted anyway. 

# A third suspect emerges (yeah, it’s Officer Bentley, wonderful foreshadowing, eh?)

About 7 years ago, after Lorenz wrote appeals to various outside groups, an NYC civil rights lawyer got involved. He made a judge retest blood at the scene for any DNA evidence of Pugh or Lorenz…there was none. 

They reassessed witnesses from the 1994 trial. Many said that they weren’t sure what they stated was actually true. One was known for cooperating with police for murder convictions. Another had a drinking problem. It just wasn’t adding up. 

**So now here comes the bomb shell...**

Richard Matt and David Sweat were in prison together and planned a successful escape in 2015. (Insane, but that’s another tale entirely). After this escape - one that left Matt dead after being shot by a border patrol agent while on the run - Sweat sent a letter to the New York Times. 

In that letter, he said that Matt confessed to the murder of Deborah Meindls…and that his partner in the murder was none other than Officer Bentley. (DUM DUM DUM)

See, Richard Matt was a long-time informant of Officer Bentley (and apparently as “close as father and son”). And what’s more, Matt lived two blocks away from Deborah Meindls in 1993. 

According to Sweat, Richard Matt and Officer Bentley would team up to “rob and collect extortion money from drug dealers.” They’d even gone to a judge’s house twice to drop off bribe money. 

But there was a problem. A woman found out what they were doing and was threatening to expose them. That woman was, according to Sweat, none other than Deborah Meindls. 

What’s more, there is also circumstantial evidence that Deborah Meindls and Officer Bentley were romantically involved – something Bentley denies. But it would certainly explain how Deborah would have found out about Bentley’s extortion racket…. 

# What the heck is happening now?

Pugh is now paroled while Lorenz remains in prison for the crime.

Like we mentioned earlier, a team of NYC attorneys has officially accused the state of getting the conviction wrong. The official trial began this week.

Her dad was in prison, her child’s father was soon headed to prison for a robbery, her mother’s boyfriend was a parolee, and neither her mother nor her boyfriend wanted Andrea to be with a man, much less have a baby with someone who was of a different race.

And then she disappeared. It was January 22, 2004 and she had visitation with her daughter scheduled for the next day. She wouldn’t have missed that. The details of her disappearance are sketchy- some say she was left leaving in a white van or truck with two hispanic males, some say it was a gold car and one unknown male. Others say it was murder. 

Was she killed for having a mixed race child? CPS had taken the child, who is now an adult, but no one seems to know why they took her or who called, though the possibility has been floated that her own family called CPS because they were upset about the race “problem.” The family did refuse to take the child because of that, but she was adopted by a loving family and whisked away from the mess of drama Andrea had to endure.

Was she killed by the man who committed statutory rape and got her pregnant? Or the mother’s boyfriend who didn’t like people of certain races? Was it the man who was mad that Andrea stole her beer, or a local who has supposedly confessed repeatedly to Andrea’s relatives? What about the man who failed multiple polygraph examinations?

This is almost all undocumented word of mouth small town gossip, but there is one fact: Andrea’s been missing for almost 18 years. Almost no one kn

555,Christmas_Leprechaun,1639877204,"Shortly before 11 p.m. on Oct. 23, 2006, Tom Wood, a Maywood Police Department K-9 officer, responded to one last call before the end of his shift — a problem of some sort by a storefront parking lot.

Turned out to be nothing, so Wood headed off. A colleague working that night figured he was going home.

Instead, Wood drove to Sixth and Erie, an area known for gang and drug problems in the long-troubled west suburb. Sitting in his marked SUV with his police dog Daro in the back, Wood ran the license plate of a Pontiac that was parked on the darkened residential street. And, for reasons still not clear, he called the girlfriend of a reputed Maywood gang member.

Within minutes, Wood, 37, was dead — shot repeatedly by someone who approached from the street and might have been talking to him through his partially opened window before opening fire.

The shooter bolted, and an intense investigation followed.

A full decade has now passed since Wood’s murder. No one has been arrested, and the police appear no closer than they ever were to catching the killer.

There were 48 cops nationwide who were “feloniously” killed in the line of duty in 2006, according to the FBI. Just three of those killings remain unsolved, those of: a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, Calif., who was shot during a traffic stop; an officer in Puerto Rico struck by gunfire amid a gang shootout; and Wood.

Early on, an entire task force of investigators, many of them from outside the suburb, focused on making an arrest, until they hit a brick wall. Today, Maywood — which, with about 24,000 residents, has 54 full-time sworn officers and is facing difficult times financially — has one detective assigned part-time to the Wood case.

Police Chief Valdimir Talley says there will be a renewed push to solve the case in 2017 — with the expected completion of a re-examination of the evidence that’s been gathered, the prospect of enhanced DNA testing and the possibility of two TV crime shows featuring the case and, Talley hopes, stirring up new tips to solve Wood’s murder.

“I owe it to the family,” Talley says, as well as fellow cops and the community “to bring closure. I’m definitely committed to getting this resolved.”

The slain officer’s widow, Helene Wood, says she’s hopeful but not optimistic the case will be solved any time soon. That’s in large part because, she says, the initial probe ended in shambles: “They don’t really have anything. What are they going to do with nothing?”

The police made plenty of mistakes:

• Bursting into the wrong house without a warrant.

• Allowing an initial suspect to wander the crime scene.

• Storing evidence in Maywood’s flood-prone police station, which ended up getting some of the evidence wet.

• Tearing down wanted posters because of a mistaken notion that a reward had dried up.

• Failing to interview some of the people Wood had seen or called in the days leading up to his murder.

And there were sometimes strong differences of opinion among investigators — in particular between Maywood cops and others on the task force — over suspects, including the reputed Maywood gang member whose girlfriend Wood had called.

Early on, some people questioned whether there might have been someone in law enforcement involved in Wood’s death. Over the years, a number of dirty cops were on the rolls of Maywood’s force —including one officer caught in 2010 stealing money from suspects during a sting. But the possibility of a cop being involved ultimately was deemed not credible.

In recent years, Helene Wood says it appeared that little work was being done on the case.

“The system failed us,” she says. “Maywood was the system.”

559,VastArt663,1639849376,"Mazen Al Hamada was a Syrian activist and a Technician  from Mohassan which was located in the governorate of Deir Ez Zor.  Mazen Al Hamada was detained by Security forces in Syria during the Arab spring protests which was against the Assad Regime who demanded Bashar Al Assad to step down and reforms. Arab Springs was a well known protest which took place  in the Middle east which happened in countries like Libya, Yemen, Tunsia, Bahrian, Egypt including Syria.  The Assad Regime had deployed Security forces who had fired at protestors with Snipers and Tanks. Protestors were detained and tortured also killed by Forces according to Human rights organizations like HRW, Amesty International and Syrian Opposition Activists. Mazen was one of the protestors who were detained. He had been imprisoned  for two and a half years for Participating in the protests. He was Severely tortured and exiled who became an Asylum seeker in the Netherlands. He Publicly testified the abuse he went through .  

Mazen had returned to Syria on October 22, 2020 he was detained by Syrian Intelligence services  and has been missing ever since.

 

At the time of the Arab Spring, Mazen Hamada, a graduate of the Institute of the Petroleum Industry, was a technician for the French multinational oil and gas company [Schlumberger](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlumberger_(entreprise)) , which had employed him for years [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) .

He takes part in demonstrations calling for more freedom and democracy. Mazen decides to film the events with his phone, his images are quickly disseminated, he is even interviewed by foreign journalists. He was arrested for the first time on April 24, 2011 by Deir Ez-Zor [State Security](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_de_la_S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9) , at his place of work, and released a week later. After a second arrest on December 29, 2011 and two weeks of detention in the same branch, knowing that he was wanted, he decided to leave for Damascus [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) , [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:2-2) .

## Arrests, imprisonment and torture 

When he arrived on March 1, 2012, he had an appointment with a doctor to whom he had to give doses of infant milk. The men embark on a car, gagged and beaten with kicks and sticks, and his two nephews, who die in detention [3](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-3) .

Mazen Hamada is led to the branch of [the air force intelligence service](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_de_renseignement_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_de_l%27air) of [Mezzeh military airport](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A9roport_militaire_de_Mezzeh) .

&gt;“They hit us on the head and on the back, then they put us in a collective cell of about 12 m². We were around 70 detainees, mainly from [Daraya](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraya) , on the outskirts of Damascus. Next to us was another cell in which they imprisoned around 70 detainees, including more than 40 Syrian army soldiers held on numerous charges such as ""considering desertion"" [4](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-4) . ""

During interrogation, under torture, he was asked to confess to being a terrorist, to possess weapons and to have killed soldiers. While he refuses to sign, claiming that he has never carried a weapon or killed, four [mukhabarat](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_de_renseignement_syriens) agents are called to come and torture him. He is hit and suspended by the wrists. To alleviate his suffering, he agrees to sign part of the ""forced confession"", admitting to having weapons to protect the demonstrators, but refuses to admit having committed crimes. He is therefore transferred to another interrogation room, where he is undressed and is sexually abused before ending up signing all of the documents [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:2-2) .

At the beginning of 2012, Mazen Hamada, suffering, was taken to [military hospital 601](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H%C3%B4pital_militaire_601&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) , nicknamed the slaughterhouse hospital, assaulted on the way and on his arrival, where he was named “1858” (his patient number). Although blindfolded, he saw detainees tortured to death, corpses piling up in the toilets. A member of staff kills dying patients there in the evening with beating. Mazen begs the doctor to return to detention [2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:2-2) .

Back at Mezzeh airport, he was treated for a month by a detained doctor, before being transferred to the Qaboun military police on June 1, 2013 then to [Adra central prison](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_d%27Adra) on June 5, 2013 where he remained. about two months. He went to the anti-terrorism court, which ordered his release and was finally released on September 3, 2013.

During his imprisonment, which lasts 2 years and 7 months, Mazen Hamada suffered all kinds of abuse, including sexual abuse, and was violently tortured; he keeps serious consequences and physical suffering, the impossibility of founding a family [5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:1-5) , [6](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-6) .

## Exile 

After his release, Mazen Hamada is still wanted by the intelligence services. He therefore decides to leave Syria and asks for asylum in the Netherlands.

Mazen Hamada is one of the few Syrians to dare to testify openly to the violence suffered in prison, as well as the crimes he witnessed. He multiplies public interventions, hoping to raise awareness in the international community of the plight of Syrian detainees and recounts his journey through Europe [7](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-7) , [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) .

His testimony is important because he memorized the names of fellow detainees, soukras (forced labor detainees) and employees of the intelligence services. In addition, the CIJA recovered various documents attesting to the presence of Mazen Hamada in various services. He files a complaint.

## Back in Syria and forced disappearance 

Mazen Hamada decides to try to return to Syria. This decision, incomprehension for his relatives and the people who met him, could be explained by various reasons.

According to their testimonies, Mazen suffered a lot, both physically, from the consequences of torture (preventing him, among other things, from being able to found a family), and psychically, both from not having a future, from not being able to testify in court, to have the feeling of having multiplied the testimonies without any effect for the people still detained in Syria. Consuming cannabis to alleviate his suffering, he would have become dependent on it, has financial problems (asylum seeker, he lives on a temporary allowance while waiting to obtain refugee status allowing him to work), cuts himself off from friends and can't find a therapist who seems to understand what he's been through. His frustration seems to radicalize his speech,[5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:1-5) .

Mazen especially wants to help the tens of thousands of Syrian detainees, for whom he feels powerless to move the lines, but he seems to have been approached by people from the Syrian embassy, ​​close to the Assad regime, and to have been lured, lured into a trap, making him dare to be able to campaign for the fate of the detainees if he returned to Syria, he writes that he is ready to sacrifice himself for that [5](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:1-5) .

Although not having a travel authorization as long as he is an asylum seeker, he goes to Berlin where he obtains a passport and visa from the embassy or consulate, a woman, probably from the embassy , gives it to him at Berlin airport [1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazen_al-Hamada#cite_note-:0-1) .

Upon his arrival at Damascus airport, he was apprehended by the regime's security services.

560,moondog151,1639848249,"(This is another case i've covered before back when I wasn't the best at making write ups and thus a case I wish to revisit with more information included)

It was January 8, 2000, and Turkey had recently entered the new millennium with business going as usual in Mısır Çarşısı a busy marketplace in Istanbul's Eminönü district. A man was out collecting picking up the papers in a rubbish bin when he noticed bloodstains on some of the papers he was retrieving. This prompted him to dig around until he found the source of the blood. A severed human leg.

Officers on patrol from the Yeşildirek Police Station were the first to arrive on the scene and after a search of the surrounding area discovered no further body parts the leg was taken for forensic examination. The examination discovered that the leg belonged to a female aged 26-27 and that it was cut cleanly from the hip. They also determined that the earliest the leg could have been severed was 24 hours and the latest 3 days. The leg was described as well-groomed with no hair and pedicured nails.

The victim was never identified and by the time the next victim was found no real progress was made.

The next incident was on May 19, 2000, and a boat had docked at Istanbul's Eminönü port when the captain heard the sound of something hitting against the bow of the boat so he went to check it out and saw another leg and at first he assumed it was a mannequin leg but soon realized it was real after poking it with a stick. The captain then reported this to the Yeşildirek Police Station. Before the police arrived though a passenger on the boat spotted another leg by the dock having washed ashore.

The police arrived and collected both the legs and they were taken for examination. They were determined to belong to the same person a woman aged 25-30. The exact time in which the legs were cut off is unknown due to being submerged in saltwater with the best estimate being a 7-10 days. They were both cut cleanly and the legs were well cared for with both the feet having red nail polish.

Investigators searched through missing person reports to try and find an identity for the woman and one possible ID they came up with was a woman named Sevim Işık a prostitute who operated in Aksaray and Taksim it's also worth noting that prostitution is legal in Turkey only in licensed brothels. The police could never confirm this identity or do the necessary test as they were unable to locate her family and thus this identity was never confirmed.

The next victim was found on December 7, 2000, by a group of high school students. Like the last two, the leg was well-groomed, hairless and pedicured. The leg was also severed precisely with the killer having knowledge of human anatomy. The leg was severed a few days before its discovery and it was thought to belong to someone who would be standing 7-8 hours a day. This victim was also unidentified.

The killer would strike again on March 12, 2001. Two legs were found in Haydar near the Unkapanı district. The legs were found 50 meters apart from each other and placed in garbage bags. However, both the legs belonged to two different people. One belonged to a woman between the ages of 20-22 and the other belonged to a man between the ages of 25-30. Both legs were severed at the knee with the woman's leg being carefully severed like the others while the man's leg was roughly cut off as if the killer hacked at it. Blood samples taken from the male's leg found traces of drugs and alcohol. Neither of the two was identified.

The next incident took place soon after on 22 March 2001 and this time the police could identify the owner of the leg. The leg was found at Tünel a subway line in Istanbul. The leg was amputated at the hip and was likely submerged in hot water before its discovery as no blood was found at the scene. The leg was identified as belonging to Yasemin Durgun a 17-year-old female law student born on September 4, 1983. Her bag was found two days later in Gümüşsuyu Park with nothing stolen except for her phone which was recovered in Tahtakale having been sold by a man determined not to be the killer. Yasemin Durgun is the only one of the killer's victims to be positively identified.

Yasemin's father was a police officer who formerly served in the military. While studying Yasemin ended up getting a boyfriend however this relationship ended up falling apart with the boyfriend saying ""School disrupts our lives, and affects our future"" Yasemin took the break up hard at first before meeting another boy simply referred to as ""AS"". Yasemin and the boy became very close friends but AS also befriended another girl simply referred to as ""SN"". During this time it is unknown what happened as details are fuzzy but the three seemed to get into a dispute which left their relationship strained but everything ended up working out.

Yasemin was last seen on March 20 and she was last seen at a post office. A meeting was arranged with AS however when Yasemin never arrived he returned to their school and asked if anyone saw Yasemin. When they all said no he reported it to the school's administrators who promptly notified the police.

On March 22, the severed leg of Yasemin was found garbage collectors at the subway tunnel like mentioned above. The police had already suspected that this leg belonged to Yasemin but her father refused to consent to allowing any DNA test to take place as he refused to believe that his daughter would fall victim to such a crime.

However on March 25 one of the payphones at Yasemin's school would ring and when a student answered a man responded and the student described him as either ""drunk"" or with a ""psychopathic voice"" the man on the other end than said ""Don't look for that girl, you won't find them."". The student reported this call to the school administration and the payphone would ring two more times and it would be the same man on the other end repeating that same sentence. After this call Yasemin's father accepted a DNA test to confirm weather the leg belonged to her daughter and that's how they finally identified their first victim in this case.

The last victim was found on July 20, 2001, at a beach in Maltepe. The leg belonged to a man between the ages of 30-35. The leg was severed at the knee and alcohol was found in the man's system. He couldn't be identified and he along with the other unidentified victims were buried in a cemetery for unidentified bodies.

The made the case their top priority however they were unable to come up with any suspects or leads as the identities of all but one victim were never determined although not for lack of trying as the police would search all nearby buildings where the legs were found to try and use ultraviolet rays to detect blood and for the second victim police employed police divers to try and search for evidence thrown into the sea. In 2002 three more severed legs would show up but these appear to be opportunistic crimes and copycats as the official victim count is 8.

A profile was set up about the killer however the profile was made by an American criminal psychologist named Richard Walter who was just told the facts of the case and likely didn't have access to primary sources so take this profile with a grain of salt as some information is likely wrong.

The killer is around 25 years old

He has a sexual motivation behind his crimes. Which wouldn't explain the male victims

The killer likely served time in prison before.

He likely spent time in Bakırköy Mental Hospital.

He is not a native of Istanbul.

The events all happened within 500 meters of each other in Odakule

The killer has no car and walks or uses public transport

What he does to hide them is unknown but he makes sure to not let the heads or hands be found so that the bodies can't be identified

He also tries to make the torso's are never found

He lets the legs get found on purpose because if he didn't at least let some body parts be found no one would know about him

He likely kills prostitutes due to them being vulnerable but since none of the victims were identified except for one with that one victim not being a prostitute this can't be confirmed.

The less precise murders and amputations done on the male victims are likely out of jealousy due to them finding success in relationships.

He likely has an inferiority complex

He steals from the victims

He revisits the crime scene to relive the experience.

He leaves the body parts in public solely to watch the panic when the crime is discovered such as leaving the leg of a victim in a subway tunnel.

As mentioned this should be taken with a grain of salt as it's not an official profile put together by the police or Turkish Criminal Psychologist.

Even though the last victim was found 20 years ago and no leads or suspects have never been found the case appears to still be open and there is even a hotline provided for anyone living in Turkey who has information that could lead to an arrest. 0212 214 40 36 however as the source providing this number is from 2002 it's unknown if this number is still active.

Hello there, obligatory “long time lurker here”, and also the disclaimer that I’m not a native English speaker, so feel free to point out any mistakes or unclear expressions.

I’d like to introduce a case that I have never encountered on any English language site, which is bizarre considering that it’s not only international – crime scene in Germany, victims from the Netherlands, perp possibly from Austria – but it’s so bizarre and nonsensical, that I can’t believe it’s still unsolved.

Now, if I tell you that this case involves tourists being murdered and robbed, you’ll probably think “That sure is tragic, but it’s not exactly a rare occurrence”, but in most such cases, the victims didn’t get comfortable in the middle of nowhere for no apparent reason, quite far off their planned route. They also didn’t bring a violin that the robber left despite its potential worth, which means that it may or may not be a red herring. Also, most robbers don’t throw away their loot after the act. And they sure don’t ride around for hours in two different taxis, one of which they use to return to the crime scene!

But let’s start at the beginning. Truus and Harry Langendonk – 61 and 63, respectively – were a couple from the Netherlands, with Harry only recently having retired from his truck brake business when they started their journey on May 29th 1997 in Delden. Their choice of transportation was a camper, a Mercedes Benz “James Cook”, and since they were safety-conscious, they preferred to sleep on designated campsites with likeminded travelers. This time, their tour was going to take them along the famous and picturesque “Deutsche Alpenstraße”, the German Alpine Road, where you can also find the popular Neuschwanstein castle. This is where the aforementioned violin comes into play: Along the route there’s a place named Mittenwald famous for its violin manufacturers, where the Langendonks presumably wanted to get an estimate on their violin’s value so they could sell it later. Other than the violin, they didn’t carry anything much valuable, only their personal jewelry (like a watch and a necklace), and their travel fund in cash.

Based on the few photos that survived and witness sightings, their progress could be established as follows: They probably spent a night near Freiburg, so they reached the Bodensee (aka Lake Constance) on May 31st. Afterwards, several pictures where taken along the planned route, with one showing Harry bathing in the Walchensee, until they were spotted at the Chiemsee on the late morning of June 6th. The next day, they spent the morning in Übersee, and then… things get weird.

According to a waitress, the couple had lunch in Marquartstein, though the establishment named Schlossberg has meanwhile closed. The couple asked the waitress about the route to Reit Im Winkl, which is about 15 km south of Marquartstein by road… but somehow, for whatever reason, the Langendonks went the opposite direction, ending up in Litzlwalchen, which is 25 to 37 km north of Marquartstein depending on the roads you use. While on this route, they stopped to call one of their three adult daughters in the Netherlands, telling her they had been in Rosenheim and where now on their way to Chiemsee to visit a violin exposition. That last part is a bit shaky, though – the violin expo was only mentioned by one news report, so there may have been a misunderstanding. However, it has led to various theories among online sleuths.

So it was about 3 in the afternoon on June 7th 1997, a hot and sunny day, when the Langendoks steered their camper off the road, following an unassuming dirt road to an unattractive spot in the middle of nowhere. And I mean unattractive: The small piece of forest, which is literally named “Hölzl” – “Little Wood” in German – is between flat meadows and fields and contains not only an unsightly gravel pit, but also an abandoned landfill that has since been renaturated. Sure, the Langendonks couldn’t see those from their spot, but still. In fact, the only interesting thing there is a model airfield, but it was too far away from the couple to be enjoyable.

Luckily, there were people on the airfield that day, and they claimed they saw two or possibly even four people moving around the camper, so the Langendonks clearly remained at their vehicle instead of, say, going for a lengthy walk. Unfortunately on the other hand, the airfield was empty when three hours later, at 6 pm, shots were fired. A woman from the nearby village of Litzlwalchen heard a shot followed by a woman screaming, then several other voices followed by 6 or 7 shots in quick succession. Unfortunately, the crime happened out of her eyeshot, but several other people corroborated what she had heard. Strangely, the camper remained in his position for two hours, but was suddenly moved at about 8 pm. Most things had haphazardly been thrown into it, including the bodies, but several shell casings and even an unspent bullet were left behind at the crime scene, as was the camper’s step ladder, which was discovered at the other end of the Hölzl during the subsequent investigation, which would also discover that the perp had not only shot the couple but also cut their throats before loading them into the vehicle.

It was already June 8th, when the perpetrator parked the camper near Nuremberg, 300 km north of the crime. He set it ablaze, presumably using the can of gasoline you can see in the police photos, and left by foot, but it didn’t take long for the flames to be noticed, and police assumes that the horns of the firetrucks scared the perpetrator so much, that he alternated between running and hiding. How do they know? Because he took surprisingly long for an otherwise short way, and since he kept dropping his loot, they could even tell where he had crossed the road. Despite his panic, he was still clever enough to take the film out of the Langendonks camera to destroy it by light exposure, but some pictures could be salvaged and at least helped confirm the timeline of the previous days.

And yes, his behavior gets even weirder.

After calling a cab from a phone booth to get to the Nuremberg train station, the perpetrator entered a taxi at 2:10 in the morning. His appearance was bizarre: On one hand, he was dressed nicely in a dark sakko (a somewhat elegant sports jacket), shirt and tie, on the other hand his hair was greasy, his fingernails were dirty, and he was so sweaty that the stench was almost unbearable to the taxi driver. He didn’t say much, but his accent was either Austrian or Southern Bavarian, and he paid his fare in French Francs after the taxi driver declined his credit card.

At 2:30 he stepped out at the train station and crossed it to reach the southern exit, where he hired yet another cab at the taxi stand. He claimed to have missed his girlfriend and that he would have to use both trains and buses to get to her, which would be too exhausting, so he took the cab. This sounds credible, but doesn’t make sense, as he changed his destination several times: First, he wanted to get to the Munich airport, then he requested the Munich Northeast train station, *which isn’t even a thing*, before finally settling on Marquartstein. However, neither he nor the taxi driver knew the roads in that area, so the driver stopped at a highway rest stop to buy a map where the taxi was captured on CCTV, but the guest can’t be seen through the windows. And then it gets borderline stupid: As soon as they reach the area known as Chiemgau, the guest suddenly knows exactly where to go and directs the driver to Litzlwalchen, where he pays the driver in Austrian Schilling and dissolves into the woods.

That was at about 5 am on June 8th 1997 and we still have nothing to go on, even though in 2017 a special force was formed after new hints had been gathered. The case currently fills 130 police folders, by the way…

It is hard to believe we don’t even have a named suspect, considering the perpetrator’s erratic behavior and his unusual appearance. He was around 30, about 1.80m tall with shoulder length, blond hair and a crooked nose that may have been broken at some point in his past. He was dressed far too nicely for a lurker in the woods – again, sakko, shirt and a tie – so why would he hang around in this terrain? And where did he even get his weapon of choice, a Tokarev TT3 Kal. 7.62, which is popular in Eastern Europe?

Aside from that, here are the most nagging questions about the case:

· How and why did the Langendonks end up in an obscure and unattractive place far off their route? If the perp had forced them into the camper and directed them to that spot, why did he wait three hours to kill them and two more to leave?

* How did the perp himself get there? Some witnesses may have seen four people around the camper, did he have an accomplice with a car? If so, why did the accomplice leave and why didn’t he rat our suspect out? Was the accomplice the real killer and the suspect just a henchman?
* Why did a seemingly cold-blooded killer commit such a clumsy overkill? He needed several shots to murder a helpless, unassuming elderly couple, additionally slit their throats, and then left his empty shells and even an unspent bullet lying at the crime scene. Sounds like an overwhelmed rookie to me…
* What was the motive anyway? The Langendonks were an elderly couple in a rather small camper, there was no reason to expect a sizeable loot. Also, the perp threw away most of the stolen goods, so they didn’t mean much to him anyway and were possibly just taken to make the identification of the victims more difficult. The violin was also left to burn.
* Speaking of which: While it is probably a red herring, why would the Langendonks stuff the thing into their small camper to have it evaluated in Germany during their vacation, when there are violin specialists in the Netherlands?

I’m at a complete loss here, as are other online sleuths and law enforcement. It’ll take a lot of luck for someone to recognize the suspect, but there is a small glimmer of hope that the Langendonks and their grieving family find some form of justice.

[Omar Raddad](https://imgur.com/a/hblTghB) was a Moroccan gardener working in France who was accused of murdering his employer, socialite Ghislaine Marchal, in her French Riviera villa on 23 June 1991. The prosecution's case largely hinged on something found at the crime scene, that being the words [*Omar m'a tuer*](https://imgur.com/a/XVQdqlu) (Omar killed me) written in Marchal's blood, and another, incomplete inscription (""Omar m'a t""). However, there was a grammatical mistake in the first inscription: the word ""tuer"" is the **infinitive** form for the word ""killed"", but the correct verb should have been the **past participle** form (""tuée""). The defence said that a wealthy, well-educated heiress would have never made such an error. Despite this, Raddad was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 1994.

Raddad has always maintained his innocence, claiming that he was framed. Raddad's conviction sparked a debate in French society, with many citing the case as a prime example of the discrimination and injustice faced by immigrants in France. *Omar m'a tuer* has become somewhat of a famous catchphrase in France. Amid mounting public pressure, including from Morocco's King Hassan II, Raddad was given a conditional pardon by the then-French president Jacques Chirac in 1996, and two years later, he was released from prison. However, his conviction has never been overturned.


**Update**

In 2014, Raddad's attorney Sylvie Noachovitch successfully petitioned the court to authorise a new DNA test on the blood evidence found at the crime scene, including the infamous *Omar m'a tuer* inscription. The test result showed that traces of four men, none of them being Raddad, were found at the crime scene. A more comprehensive test conducted in 2019 found 35 traces of one of the four men on the second inscription (""Omar m'a t""). With this new evidence, Raddad's defence team filed a request in June to France's appeals court to review the evidence and reopen the case, which was granted on 17 December 2021.

569,Personal-Proposal-91,1639808855,"WARNING: I just want everyone to know that I will attempt to be as accurate as possible in this heated case, as it might still be a touchy subject for people today. So yeah, please be civil!

&amp;#x200B;

It was April 26, 1913. And 13 year old Mary Phagan went to get her payment from her boss, the case's prime suspect Leo Frank, at his office. Awhile later, she would be dead. But what happened? 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that, contrary to the modern opinion, that Leo Frank was the culprit.

&amp;#x200B;

Her corpse was badly mutilated and she was raped prior to her grim death. She was found in the basement of the National Pencil Company, Frank's company, a day later. There was a hand written note next to her body, which was attempting to incriminate the night watchman Newt Lee. It was later revealed that the letter was actually written by the case's only other suspect, Jim Conley. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few suspects were interrogated, Leo Frank was arrested and charged with murder. Jim Conley was also apprehended as well, after lying to the police twice before breaking down and telling the story. And Conley's story was largely accurate. He stated that Frank accidentally murdered Phagan and needed his help to dump the body and write the ransom note to frame Lee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blood spots were found in the exact location Conley said that they were in, and Phagan's hair fibers were found in the same location he claimed to have found the body as well. Blood spots were also found in the same area Conley claimed to have accidentally dropped Phagan before picking her back up again, and the dragging marks on the floor matched his story to a t. 

&amp;#x200B;

Frank's most important case to prove his innocence was the 'shit in the shaft' theory, where Jim Conley claimed to have taken a crap on the elevator shaft, which crushed it later on when authorities entered the basement. The idea is that if the shit was only crushed by the authorities when they entered, that Conley was lying. However, this is not really the case as there's no definitive answer as to if the authorities were the first to crush the crap, due to the incredibly dirty floor and lack of evidence to support the claim in case documents.

&amp;#x200B;

However, evidence of Frank's guilt widens drastically throughout the trial. He constantly changed his story. Initially stating Phagan came into his office to collect her pay at 12:03, he later changed it to 12:05-12:07 and then even later on to 12:10-12:15! He was even proven to have lied about being in his office at the time of the killing, which was between 12-12:10. A witness went to his office at 12 and Frank was nowhere to be seen, and at this same time he claimed that Phagan was talking to a female worker that was proven to not have even existed! He also admitted that he was completely alone with her in his office.

&amp;#x200B;

He was also highly nervous in both police interviews and, according to the testimonies of Newt Lee and Jim Conley, was almost neurotic when Phagan was even mentioned after the murder. When Lee, who was completely exonerated at this point, mentioned that the murder could've taken place at daytime, Frank freaked out and did not want to speak on the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Conley and many other witnesses, Leo Frank was a sexual predator. Conley would claim that he stood guard as Frank would attempt to seduce teenage workers. Conley also had special privileges at the company, as he was the only worker that didn't have to punch in. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the smoking gun for me came from Leo Frank's testimony. When asked where he was between 12-12:10 in his final statement, he said that he might've 'subconsciously' went for a bathroom break! He pretty much shot himself in the foot IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Leo Frank was sentenced to death for the murder of Mary Phagan, which was later commuted to life imprisonment, which got him lynched by an angry mob. Jim Conley was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and is the prime suspect according to modern historians.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think happened to Mary Phagan? You might be better detectives than myself, so I'd love to hear your thoughts!

*On 27 October 2006, the body of a woman was discovered in a marshy field near the Darlington Nuclear Plant in Bowmanville, Ontario. Investigators determined that the woman was between 18 and 25 years old at the time of her death, whilst also noting that she had prominent, protruding upper teeth and visible white fillings on her front teeth.*

*A number of items were also found within the vicinity of the woman, which may have belonged to her, including a watch, a ring, and clothing, images of which you can see on the screen here. Although efforts were made to identify her, these proved unsuccessful, and she later became known as Bowmanville Jane Doe.*

*One of the difficulties faced by the investigators tasked with identifying her was the uncertainty concerning her date of death – it’s currently believed that she could have died at any point between 1981 and 2004. Another issue was the mistaken belief that Bowmanville Jane Doe was of European descent. Although the initial sketches produced of her depicted a white woman, DNA testing has since revealed that she was predominantly of African descent, with a substantial degree of South Asian heritage too.*

*This was discovered by the DNA Doe Project, otherwise known as the DDP, a non-profit organisation that works to identify John and Jane Does using investigative genetic genealogy. I’m one of the DDP volunteers working on Bowmanville Jane Doe’s case at the moment and we’ve recently come across new information that may be helpful in identifying her.*

*We’ve discovered that she was likely either from the Caribbean or was of recent Caribbean descent, based on her admixture and the heritage of her DNA matches. Although no one country can be definitively pinned down at this point, it seems that Bowmanville Jane Doe had distant cousins in countries such as Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, though she may well have had familial ties to other parts of the Caribbean too.*

*If you know of any missing relatives or friends who fit this description and timeframe, please consider contacting Detective Hermano Dorego of the Durham Regional Police Service at 905-579-1520, with the extension 5319, or email him at hdorego@drps.ca.*

*Additionally, if you have roots in any of the countries or regions mentioned, please consider uploading your DNA to GEDmatch and FTDNA. If you do turn out to be a DNA match to Bowmanville Jane Doe, your upload could be the factor that allows her to be reunited with her name after all these years.*

578,DJHJR86,1639757477,"Nick Hillary did.

If you are unaware about this case, it was the subject of a 2019 [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_Garrett_Phillips%3F) (*heavily* slanted in favor of Nick Hillary) which delved into the mystery of who murdered 12 year old Garrett Phillips in his apartment on October 24, 2011 in Postdam, NY.  Garrett lived in the apartment with his half-brother and mother, Tandy Cyrus.  Tandy and the half-brother were not home at the time of the murder (thankfully).  On the date of the murder, neighbors of Garrett heard a [commotion](https://dailygazette.com/2016/09/15/neighbor-potsdam-killing/) which sounded like a struggle.  Alarmed, they called 911, and the first responding officer arrived on the scene at [5:16 p.m.](https://www.northcountrynow.com/news/police-officer-and-emt-who-responded-scene-garrett-phillipss-death-take-stand-potsdam-murder).  After the responding officer got no response from the apartment, he called the landlord to come unlock the door.  A few minutes later, the officer and landlord entered the apartment and found Garrett not breathing and with no pulse.  EMTs arrived and were able to start his heart again, but unfortunately, Garrett died at the hospital.  An autopsy confirmed that Garrett had been strangled to death.  Outside of the apartment, a [window](https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/160928_vod_lead_investigator1_16x9_608.jpg) was pushed out (the woman in the photo shows the route the killer would have taken) and the killer apparently jumped from the window onto the ledge below, before jumping down onto the ground and escaping.  Police found a slip mark in the wet grass (it was lightly raining that day) where the killer appeared to have slipped on the ground when jumping from the ledge.  

Initially, the police investigated the theory that perhaps Garrett was killed by peers, but no concrete leads could be established.  They asked Garrett's mother, Tandy, if she knew of anyone who did not like Garrett and the only name she could think of was an ex-boyfriend of hers, **Nick Hillary**.  Nick and Tandy had dated for a year, but their children did not get along (and according to Tandy, Garrett did not like Nick **at all**), so eventually they both broke up.  The police were also interested in two other ex-boyfriend's of Tandy's, the father of Garrett's half-brother, and an ex-boyfriend named John Jones, who was previously a local sheriff's deputy.  The police spoke with the father of Garrett's half-brother, who allowed himself to be photographed, and voluntarily gave DNA and fingerprint samples.  He also had an alibi.  John Jones also did the same.  Jones told the investigators that he took his dog for a walk **in the opposite direction** of where Garrett's apartment shortly after 5:00 p.m., and eventually turned around and came back home around 15 minutes later.  Surveillance footage from across the street of Jones's home confirms this.  The police then turned their attention to Nick Hillary.

A friend called Nick the day after the murder and told him that one of Tandy's kids had been involved in ""an accident and I think he's dead"", to which [Nick](  https://abcnews.go.com/US/closing-arguments-fate-nick-hillary-now-judges-hands/story?id=42276731) never once asked the friend as to which of Tandy's sons it was (Garrett or his half-brother) nor did he inquire as to what had happened.  Later that day, that the investigators called him and asked if he would come to the station to answer some questions about the death of ""Tandy's 10 year old son"" (Garrett was 12) and Nick, again not questioning anything, agrees.  But he calls his friend (who is a lawyer) and then calls the investigators back and says he cannot leave because his teenage daughter is with him and he didn't want to leave her alone.  The investigators say they can stop by his place instead, and Nick agrees.  They very briefly question Nick and this is the first time (according to Nick) that he learns of Garrett's death.  The investigators leave and return the next morning at around 7:30 a.m. and ask again if he could come down to the station to answer some questions and Nick agrees.

At the station, they ask some general questions about some kids that Garrett may have known, potential enemies, etc. and Nick is very cooperative.  When they ask him ""where were you that day"", he becomes *very* defensive and refuses to answer anymore questions.  He refuses to be photographed, fingerprinted, or have DNA taken from him.  At that same moment, the police detain him at the station because they were actively trying to obtain a search warrant for his clothes, his person, and his car.  Nick calls his family attorney, Jane Garland, and she arrived shortly around noon.  At this point, the police ordered pizza and were holding Nick in a kitchen area where he was guarded by a state trooper.  The trooper observed Jane Garland taking a piece of pizza that Nick was eating, take a large bite out of it, and then place it in her purse.  Nick was also allowed to smoke while waiting for the authorization of the search warrant, and after smoking cigarettes, he would crumble the butts up in his hand, and put the remains in his pockets.  The search warrant was finally executed at around 4:00 p.m. and the police took Nick's clothes and photographed his body.  They noticed a fresh cut (later testified to under oath as happening within 24-48 hours) and abrasion on his ankle.  Nick and his supporters would later say this was done to humiliate and dehumanize him.  However, he was the **only** suspect or person of interest who did not cooperate.  

Eventually after a 5 year ""battle"", Nick was charged for the murder of Garrett (I'll get to the evidence below and why I think he is definitely guilty).  The issue of race became a central issue, because Potsdam is a largely white community and Nick is a black man.  The defense opted to go with a bench trial instead of a jury trial, and after three weeks, the judge acquitted Nick Hillary.  Since Nick's acquittal, no [new](https://www.nny360.com/news/crime/garrett-phillips-revisited-recent-leads-in-murder-case-fall-flat/article_615185e3-73a4-511c-a287-43c85b845d14.html) leads have turned up anything substantial.  Nick would go on to sue, but [several](https://www.nny360.com/news/several-hillary-claims-tossed/article_0ebd1953-4107-5aaf-ab70-ddaf06eb332d.html) of his claims were [dismissed](https://www.nny360.com/news/stlawrencecounty/former-da-rain-dismissed-from-federal-suit-over-nick-hillary-prosecution/article_7fd37c78-0e8a-57a9-8e42-7074ad77b27e.html).  Some of them are still pending.  

I truly believe Nick Hillary got away with murder.  The biggest piece of evidence against him was surveillance footage from the day of the [murder](https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/videos-show-nick-hillary-day-garrett-phillips-murder-42488444).  At two separate dispositions (Nick Hillary filed a civil suit against the Potsdam police department *before* any criminal charges were filed against him, which opened him up to having to testify at a deposition under oath), Nick admitted that he was driving the silver SUV seen in the Potsdam High School parking lot at 4:47 p.m.  He was a soccer coach and said he was there to scout a soccer game being played.  He never left his vehicle and his view was obstructed by a school bus blocking the soccer field.  He says he never got out of his car because it was pouring down, but video shows multiple people walking around without umbrellas.  After six minutes, he claims to have left the parking lot and turned right to go home.  The actual footage, however, captured Garrett Phillips riding his [skateboard](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/five-year-journey-garrett-phillips-case-n657616) **at the base of the Potsdam High School parking lot**.  Garrett is in the frame for about 16 seconds, and when he disappears from frame, you can clearly see Nick Hillary's car back up and exit the parking lot by going **left in the direction of Garrett's home**.  When confronted with this inconsistency at his second disposition, he says that he turned left to go visit a friend (and one of his assistant soccer coaches) to confirm he would be at practice later that night.  This would have been roughly around 4:55 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The assistant coach, however, says Nick arrived while he was in the middle of a phone call that he placed at 5:21 p.m.

Nick's daughter also claims to have been home with him eating dinner within the timeline of Garrett's murder.  But investigators found where she texted him later that night at around 6:30 p.m. to ask him what they were going to have for dinner.  The investigators did find a fingerprint on the window where Garrett's killer would have escaped which did not match Nick.  It did not match John Jones (the man who Nick's supporters continue to insist is the ""real killer"" despite all evidence to the contrary) nor any of the other suspects, Tandy, Garrett, or Garrett's half-brother.  But Garrett did in fact have DNA found under one of his fingernails.  

The initial DNA testing found a mixture of Garrett's DNA (95%) and an unknown male (5%).  Hillary's DNA matched 6 out of the 6 of 15 alleles that were able to be identified on the unknown DNA profile, which was not enough to conclusively match him.  But it also did not exclude him.  They later ran more advanced testing (which degraded the sample to have no further testing) and were able to identify 9 out of the 15 alleles.  Nick Hillary matched all 9.  A forensic company out of New Zealand, Starmix, took the results of the DNA testing and ran them into a probability matrix which they came up with 1 in 30 million that anyone other than Nick Hillary as being the contributor of the DNA found under Garrett's fingernail.  The judge at Nick's trial excluded all of this evidence prior to the start of Nick's trial.  

Virtually every story featured about this case is always presented in the most favorable light to Nick Hillary.  I have no doubt in my mind that a murderer got off.  I'd like to hear any other opposing theories or information that could potentially change my mind.",UnresolvedMysteries,Who Killed Garrett Phillips?,0

More than three decades after an 80-year-old descendant of one of Greenville’s leading legal families was found in her kitchen stabbed to death, prosecutors and police have closed the case, satisfied they unraveled a mystery that haunted two generations of detectives. It took scientific advancements in DNA technology and painstaking detective work to finally name a killer in a brutal murder that stunned Greenville. Alice Haynsworth Ryan died in her Tudor mansion beside Greenville’s Cleveland Park on an October afternoon in 1988.

She was stabbed 37 times. The killer eluded investigators due to a number of missteps, little evidence left behind and a randomness not normally seen at that time in a small Southern city like Greenville

old newspapers were left on her porch. The killer likely did not suspect she was inside. “You just don’t have that type of murder every day,” said Buddy Burgess, one of the detectives who worked on the case in the early years. “Lot of legwork. We worked every angle. We just couldn’t put it together.” One reason: The man now identified as the killer was shot and killed only a few months after Mrs. Ryan was murdered. Now, more than 30 years later, investigators say they have finally pieced together the story of what happened on that fall afternoon.

Greenville native Alice Haynsworth was the daughter of Harry Haynsworth, who founded the law firm that still bears his name. Hers was a life of privilege, growing up in a mansion on North Main Street that is now the Thomas McAfee Funeral Home. Her nephew was Clement Haynsworth, a federal judge whose nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was scuttled during Richard Nixon’s administration. A great-nephew is Knox White, Greenville’s longtime mayor who was a city councilman when Ryan was murdered. She married Joseph Ryan, a New York native, who would take over his family’s textile business in Greenville. They had three children, Joseph Jr., Katherine and Rhoda. On Oct. 8, 1988, Ryan had been a widow for 30 years, living alone in the 7,000-square-foot house she and her husband built on 2 acres not far from downtown Greenville. Suffering from cancer, Ryan had been an inpatient receiving chemotherapy at St. Francis Hospital. Before picking up her mother from the hospital that day, Katherine Stribling ran errands and stopped by Ryan’s house to borrow serving items for a party she was having at her Columbia home. Stribling used a screwdriver to open a stuck cabinet while she was there.

and Stribling left to pick up hot dogs for lunch and a few items from a small grocery near her mother’s house. She was gone for perhaps 40 minutes. When she returned, as she walked toward the house, she saw a piece of glass in the back door was broken. Stribling moved to insert her key into the lock, but the door opened on its own. Then she saw her mother lying on the floor, wounds on her abdomen. Stribling ran back out the door to summon help. THE INVESTIGATION Police and EMS converged on the Ryan house. It soon became apparent EMS was not needed. The elderly woman was dead.

When Knox White arrived, he noticed Ryan’s car was missing, and within an hour, someone reported the car abandoned in the middle of a road, not far from her house. Officers searched the area and in some brush found a screwdriver that had been wiped off, a bloody dish towel from Ryan’s house and a house key. No car key. A few days later, detectives went back to the site and found a knife they believed had been used in the attack, wiped clean. Four of Ryan’s wounds would have been fatal, the autopsy showed. As suspected, she was stabbed with a screwdriver and a knife. There wasn’t much blood despite the savage attack. Authorities came away with one thought: overkill. She had been stabbed many more times than it took to kill her, often a sign of anger, causing them to wonder, did the murderer know Ryan? The police chief at the time, Mike Bridges, told The Greenville News nothing tied the family to the murders. Despite hundreds of hours, months of interviews, the case went cold.

By 1999, Greenville Police were ready to look again. It fell to Greenville Police investigator Buddy Burgess to see if a killer could be identified. “You just don’t get those type of murders every day,” he said recently. “It upset the whole community.” Detectives started fresh. They worked every angle, every lead and just could not put it together. The paperwork on the investigation ultimately would fill four or five storage boxes. Despite the lack of resolution, the case was never closed. In 2017, Greenville’s new police chief Ken Miller formed a cold case unit due to a backlog of more than a dozen unsolved murder cases. Alice Ryan’s case was the first to be investigated. Former Greenville Police Detective Rick Woodall came into it knowing Ryan’s case was among the longest unsolved murders in the city’s history. He knew Joe Ryan, who became a reserve police officer after his mother died. They started by interviewing every officer who had taken part in the earlier investigation and painstakingly went through the evidence boxes. It took months. They called on a forensic investigator from the State Law Enforcement Division to look at the evidence to determine what should be sent to the crime lab for testing. Science had grown into a powerful investigatory tool by then. Investigators were counting on new technology to show them the way. TECHNOLOGY POINTS TO A SUSPECT In early 2018, they elected to send to the crime lab clothing, the screwdriver, the butcher knife and a cigarette butt labeled “debris.” It had been found in Ryan’s car, stored away for decades in a police evidence locker. Alice Ryan’s 1967 Ford Galaxy was missing for about two hours on the day she was murdered. A cigarette butt found inside led investigators to the killer 33 years later. Greenville Police PROVIDED It took months, but DNA on the cigarette matched that of Brian Munns, who lived in Columbia for a time and in Americus, Georgia. He had a record of convictions for larceny, strong arm robbery and criminal sexual conduct and had been in Greenville for a few weeks during that time period around Ryan’s murder. Woodall and retired police lieutenant Don Belue had already interviewed Munns in Georgia. They obtained a warrant for his arrest and charged him with stealing Ryan’s car and accessory after the fact of murder. Once the DNA tests came back, the charge was upgraded to murder. Police also were hearing about a fellow named Lamar Green, who was seen with Munns on the day Ryan was killed. He had a record of burglaries. Green had been a suspect from the early days of the investigation but died a few months after Ryan. His mother-in-law shot him, as he held a gun on family members, including her daughter. Justifiable homicide, police said. Munns was placed in the Greenville County Detention center under a no-bond hold. Months passed. He remained silent. PROVING THE CHARGE Meanwhile, the 13th Circuit Solicitor’s Office prepared for trial. They had witnesses who put Munns in Ryan’s car, and his DNA was found inside it. They told him they were ready to proceed. By early 2021, Munns had fired his first lawyer who told him to keep quiet. His new lawyer encouraged Munns to tell what he knew. At last, Munns told investigators he did ride around with Green on that day in Ryan’s car. Green wanted to sell it to him, he said. Other witnesses saw the two men together in the car in a neighborhood not far from Ryan’s house. Munns said he was not in Ryan’s house, that Green was the murderer. “Based on the evidence, we felt this all made sense,” Deputy Solicitor William McMaster said this month. In September, Munns pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony — or not reporting a crime — and was sentenced to four years. Time served. And with that plea, 33 years after Ryan’s death, police closed the book on their investigation. The police, the family feel some amount of closure, McMaster said. It was a crime of opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of posts about her case already, so I linked the story above to summarize for anyone unaware. I wanted to talk about the dollar bill, supposedly written by Mikelle Biggs, that is suspected to be a hoax. I don't want to claim that it contains any definitive information, but I think the message on the dollar bill may contain a hidden message if it *isn't* fake. A few of the main arguments for the dollar bill being fake are the misspelled name and the handwriting. While I think these are strong reasons to dismiss the dollar bill as a hoax, there are counterarguments such as there not being enough room to write her full name.

""My name is Mikel..."" is not written from corner-to-corner. With handwriting, it can sometimes be tricky to estimate the amount of space you have to write. She may have been using the corners to hold down the bill to write more clearly. Arizona was also abbreviated to ""AZ,"" either to save room, time, or to reduce any irrelevant letters that can possibly construe the hidden message.

There have also been comments saying that the handwriting doesn't match Mikelle's. This bill was printed in 2009, but Mikelle was born in 1987. I don't think the handwriting of an 11-year-old will be similar to that of someone older than 21. Not to mention the stress and pressure of getting a message on a dollar bill and hoping your kidnapper doesn't see you.

What bothered me the most, was how the ""s"" in ""is"" on the right side of the bill looks a lot like the number 5, and is almost written horizontally, rather than vertically like the rest of the words on the left edge of the bill, looking very intentional. The very first ""M"" resembles a 3, and it looks like extra pressure was put on the pen to resemble the number as well.

Some letters in the message are capitalized, while some are not. The very first ""M"" in the message is sharp, while the rest are smooth. Some other capital letters I found were M, S, B, F, two As, and an I. I put these letters in a word unscrambler, but only got ""Mafia,"" and ""Samba.""

The two lowercase ""L""s in the message are used inconsistently. One is cursive, while the other is print. Maybe the second ""L"" is the number 1? For the ""B"" in ""Briggs"" I mentioned earlier, I see either an 8, or a ""B"" with a hidden 3 applied as extra pen pressure.

I also see a lowercase ""e"" as the dot for the ""i"" in ""kidnapped."" But this can probably be explained because a dot above an ""i"" can be written in circular motion. However, I also notice a hidden ""i"" in front of the Arizona abbreviation ""Az."" It looks more like an attempt to fix the letter ""A,"" but these could also be related. But at the same time, these both could be less significant.

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I have so far. I'm going to obsess over the message for a while, but I was hoping to find others who enjoy finding clues and deciphering messages to see if maybe we can find something new in the message.",UnresolvedMysteries,Clues in Mikelle Biggs' Dollar Bill Message?,0

María Juanita, Nestor and Jordan Logro Choloquinga were three of six children born to Jorge Logro and María Choloquinga. They were seven, five and three years old respectively. The family lived in a rented house in the southern part of Quito (Ecuador's capital), in a neighborhood called Nueva Aurora. I couldn't find the exact details of what happened on the day the kids disappeared (Tuesday 20, August 2013), only that they were alone in their house while their parents went to the market, once Jorge and María came back they found three of their kids were gone. The parents immediately reported this and police started to search areas near the house. Less than a month later, on September 10, the body of Juanita was found inside a bag near a garbage dump in a place called Ciudadela del Ejército, 2 km away from where she lived. The autopsy determined she had been raped and then strangled. No one of the sources I checked mention if police was able to collect DNA from the perpetrator from Juanita's body. Around this time the case gained certain notoriety and even the then President Rafael Correa met with the family. 

On September 19, police announced a suspect had been apprehended in relation with the case. In the official statement, they said this person had contacted the Logro family and claimed to have information about their children, they tracked this person and found they resided in the Santo Domingo province, which is around three hours away from Quito. A news article I found (very short) added that this person was a woman and she had been trying to extort the parents. There is also a news clip that mentions this woman was eventually cleared of any involvement in the case.  

On October 3, not too far from where Juanita's body had been found, inside the Calicanto ravine, the body of Jordan was found. Later that month, on October 30, Nestor's body was also found in a wasteland in the same area. The boy's corpses were in a very advanced state of decomposition and the coroner was not able to determine a cause of death, however the prosecutors confirmed their deaths were being treated as a homicide. Their identities were confirmed via DNA testing because of this same reason. 

On November of the same year, police carried out a search in a house in the Nueva Aurora neighborhood, the article I found doesn't mention why they looked into that particular house, only that luminol tests had been made and the results of this investigation were not made public. 

Juanita, Nestor and Jordan were buried in Saquisili, in their parent's native province of Cotopaxi. The last news article I found about the case is from August 2014, almost a year after the kids originally disappeared from their home. It mentions the case is still open and the parents hadn't had any update from prosecutors about the case. As of today, no one has been charged or arrested in connection to what happened to the Logro siblings.

Two of these murders, those of Ronnie Gorlin and Elyse Rapp in July 1975, were perpetrated by a man who deflated the victims' tires at the 163rd Street Mall in North Miami Beach.  Both victims were Jewish and both drove cars with ""E"" license plates, indicating that their cars were leased or rented.

These cases have been a passion of mine and I am proud to have written a book about the cases.  I'd like to see if Unresolved Mysteries has any thoughts--

Only one murder, that of Judith Oesterling in January 1975, was solved.  Two detectives who investigated the Flat Tire Murders, whom I interviewed in 2020 both believe, to this day that Ted Bundy killed Rapp and Gorlin.  But Bundy was in Utah in 1975.  Could he have travelled to South Florida in July 1975 and killed these two young women?

I spoke with Kevin Sullivan, author of several Bundy books, who said it was unlikely that Bundy was involved in these murders.  What does Unresolved Mysteries think?  I need your input!

PS: Bundy's first visit to Miami was in 1968 as a delegate to the Republican National Convention for Nelson Rockefeller.

PPS: This is my third attempt to post something in Unresolved Mysteries.  I hope it works! I'm trying my best--

Her two-tone blue 1989 Aerostar van was found in a Napa neighborhood. Janie had been going through tough times after losing her job as the administrator of a retirement home in San Rafael. But a few hours before her disappearance Janie Coe was seen by a friend, who told police she was in a good mood that day, as she had gone to a two-hour training for a new job with a cosmetics company.

It is unclear why Janie's van was found in a Napa residential neighborhood, far from any transit services, as Janie did not like to venture far from home. She left behind her eyeglasses and one of her contact lenses, which she needed to drive. She also left behind a cat that she'd owned for 16 years and all of her clothes and possessions.

Coe's debit card was used by someone other than herself at 6:00 p.m. on the day of her disappearance to withdraw $20 from her bank account. She had been known to lend her debit card to friends, but authorities have been unable to identify the person who used it on the day of her disappearance. The individual is described as a heavyset woman. Police want to question the woman but she’s never been identified. 

Today it was announced that new DNA has been found regarding her case, it has not been released what was found. 

A reward of up to $2,500 is being offered by the Sonoma County Alliance Community Engagement and Safety Rewards Fund for information that leads to an arrest.

602,kepler415,1639630614,"In September 9, 2014, kayakers that were in the North Creek just above virgin, found a human skull, according to police. The skull was found a day after a heavy rain flooded the area. When the searchers went back to the area, more remains, including a pelvis, were found.

Former police chief Kurt Wright said he still had a hard time letting go of the mystery of a skull and other human remains that washed up in 2014 following a series of heavy storms.

The state medical examiner determined that the remains belonged to a white man, who was between 35 to 45 years old, was between 5-foot-6 and 6-foot-1, and likely died sometime between 2009 and 2014. The man also had some well healed fractures to his nose and skull and also a poor dental work, according to a press release from Springdale police in 2014.

A report from the medical examiner's office concluded the fractures were caused either by ""a blunt force blow to the right side of the head or the head hitting a blunt object during a fall"".

But there were no reports of missing people in the area. More strange, former police chief Kurth Wright said he doesn't remember any unsolved cases that would match the unidentified skeleton. DNA from the skeletal remains sent to Texas has gotten a hit on any databases, including national systems for missing people. ""It's just not a normal place to find human remains,"" Wright said.

Based on the fractures, Wright believed that ""it's either a suicide or a homicide.""

During that time in 2017, Wright hoped that new leads would be generated by publicly talking about the case again, one that he said he wants to get closure for both the victim's family and himself. Wright also retired from police after 30 years from work.

Apart from that, I couldn't find much on this John Doe. However there was a Websleuths user named YaYa\_521 (I don't know if I can link Websleuths website because of its infame in this subreddit) that mentioned the case of Randall Craig Irvin who disappeared in December 16, 2011 from Hurricane, Washington County in Utah. Hurricane is approximately 45 minutes from Virgin, Utah where the remains of John Doe was located. Though YaYa\_521 said they didn't found ""any reference to prior head or nose injuries nor can I see his teeth to try to determine whether he'd fit the ""poor dental work"" description"" but specualted the injuires could have happened after his disappearance in 2011. They said they would submit Irvin for a comparison.

The Charley Project says that Irvin is a ""Caucasian male. Blond hair, blue eyes. Irvin may have a goatee. He is balding."" The website also says that Irving left all his personal belongings behind at home and has never been heard from again. He was an avid outdoorsman at the time of his disappearances. Unfortunately few details are available on his case.

One important thing to notice in Irvin had an history of suicidal ideation. Kurth Wright believed that the John Doe might have died from suicide. With very few details on Irvin case, it's hard to form a theory. However, given the circumstances that Irvin was an outdoorsman, could it be possible that he was exploring the North Creek area to make sure that nobody would find him there should he die? Or could he simply get lost during his outdoor activities?

John Doe had an estimated age of 35 to 45 years old, while Irvin was 51 years old. One thing to note that the Irvin's theory may be incorret is that the fact John Doe could have died in 2009, and Irvin disappeared in 2011. If it wasn't Irvin, then it was a transient who happened to be at the North Creek?

I hope this John Doe can get identified and the family get closure. Also, I don't think Irvin is still alive, given his suicidal ideations, but I hope that his family can get closure if his body is found.

605,Humble-Ad-8507,1639616092,"William Tyrell disappeared at the age of three from Kendall, NSW Australia on 12 September 2014. 
He was famously wearing a spiderman suit at the time of his disappearance and had been playing at his foster grandmother's house when he vanished. His foster mother stated that he was playing outside while she made tea briefly, and she  noticed it went quiet. She went out to check on William but he was nowhere to be found. 

LE theories ranged from abduction to paedophile rings, and a local washing machine repairman was investigated. 

There are several posts here on reddit far more detailed about his actual disappearance, including posts on discrepancies in the case such as photo time stamps not matching up, and a neighbour reporting seeing a car speed off with a child wearing a spiderman costume in the back. 

Fast forward, and just recently charges were brought against William Tyrells foster parents for alleged assault on a child (not William, possibly his sister who remained in their care).  A search was instigated in and around the (now deceased) foster grandmother's property and her old car. 
 
After the hype and the promise from LE to figure out what happened to William, its disheartening to hear that they are finishing up with this latest search at the foster grandmothers house. 
However a bone fragment has been found a day after announcing the forthcoming end of the search. 

It has not (that I can find) yet been revealed if the bone is human. Furthermore I cannot find any information on the string and fabric found in the search area. If these findings are actually evidence relating to William's disappearance I suppose all will be revealed eventually.

611,fablur,1639605183," I did not see any post about this disappearance, so I decided to make one. I apologize in advance if there are any spelling errors in my post.

[Delphine Jubillar](https://images.lindependant.fr/api/v1/images/view/61b8bebb3e45463854022286/large/image.jpg?v=1) was a nurse, she was 33 when she disappeared. Since 2013, she was married to [Cedric Jubillar](https://images.ladepeche.fr/api/v1/images/view/61b6fd208fe56f7f72314d14/large/image.jpg?v=4), a drywall painter worker. They had two children together.

In the summer of 2020, Delphine Jubillar announces her desire for a divorce. According to her lawyer, the divorce seemed to be carried out by mutual agreement.

On December 16, 2020 in the early morning, Cédric Jubillar, worried, call the police of Cagnac-les-Mines, a french commune of 2,600 inhabitants. Woken up around 4 a.m. by one of his children, he notices that his wife Delphine has disappeared. According to his words, his wife left wearing her white puffer jacket and with her cell phone. She was said to have gone out to walk the couple's two dogs who returned home alone around 4 a.m. waking up the husband. A neighbor then reportedly testified that she saw the 33-year-old nurse in the street between two and four in the morning. Cédric Jubillar sounded the alert on September 16 at 4:30 a.m.

Despite a major search device deployed in the days following the disappearance of Delphine Jubillar, no trace of the nurse could be identified. Beyond human resources, with around fifty policeman and divers used for this search, the police used a helicopter and a drone to try to locate her.

During the night, the behavior of Cédric Jubillar put question the police. When the police arrived there in the middle of the night, the husband was throwing a washing machine with the duvet used by his wife who was sleeping on the bed. (he will explain that the dogs have dirtied it with mud) while the condition of the house was neglected. The pedometer on Cédric Jubillar's phone shows that he took only 40 steps before calling the police, which shows ""a summary search"", according to the magistrate. Thus, the tour of the house and the garden with the police will have constituted more than 380 steps on his phone.

His eagerness to contact the police only about 15 minutes after he woke up has been questioned. He tries to reach his wife 180 times until 10 a.m. on the morning of his disappearance, then the next morning (December 17) twice, then no more calls will be made.

Delphine Jubillar's phone disappears with her. He stopped broadcasting on the morning of December 16 within a radius of 2 km around her home. Her phone turned for the last time at 10:55 p.m. (then goes to voicemail at 7:48 a.m.); he then triggers a relay close to home but which is not the relay to which he usually limits when Delphine is at home. The flashlight on Delphine's phone was never turned on that night, when the street was not lit, it was pitch dark, and she disappeared without her vehicle. However, on January 13, 2021, an empty message was posted from her Facebook account (she is the only one who have access to it). Three hypotheses are put forward: that of a bug in the application, hacking or even a malfunction resulting from investigators' investigations into the computer equipment of the missing person. The hypothesis of piracy would have been favored by the police too.

On February 9, the phone seemed to be reactivated again (more precisely the Messenger application16) without there again a single explanation being able to be put forward.

During the press conference of June 18, 2021, it was specified by the prosecutor that these reactivations would be a technical consequence of the computer searches of the investigators, which was confirmed to them by Samsung.

In the process of divorce with Cédric Jubillar, Delphine had a romantic relationship with another man. The man in question confided in an interview with a newspaper that the story between him and Delphine had started on the Internet ""six months before his disappearance"". He also said that he and Delphine Jubillar were planning to move in together and that the night she disappeared shortly before 11 p.m., she sent him a picture of her ""in nightgown, showered and ready to go to bed."" Then, The outfit will be found during the first search in the dirty laundry bin.

Delphine Jubillar's car was also part of the investigation. According to the testimonies of the neighbors, the vehicle was moved during the night, since it was in forward gear, while Delphine Jubillar always put it in reverse gear in the evening so as to be ready to leave the next morning. In addition, traces of condensation were found in the car. However, no trace of blood was found in the house or in the vehicle in question.

The same night, around 11 p.m, the cries of a woman, supposedly the ones of Delphine, were heard by two witnesses (two neighbors of the couple), corroborating the testimony of the eldest of the family, aged 6Y, who heard a violent argument between his parents that same evening.

Cédric Jubillar has been arrested on June 18, 2021 for aggravated murder. According to the public prosecutor, ""it has been established that it is a disappearance which is unlikely to be voluntary"". Relying on the profile of Delphine Jubillar, who was planning to divorce her husband to settle down with a new companion, who loved her job and who had made plans for the future, the trail of suicide or voluntary disappearance has been ruled out.

The divorce between Cédric and Delphine Jubillar ""gave rise to a lot of arguments between them. Cédric Jubillar had great difficulty accepting this separation"" and ""tried to win back"" his wife, but in a brutal way to say the least. Thus, he had organized a real surveillance of his wife, going to her account to see if she had made any expenses, being very intrusive on the way in which his wife organized her separation"", reported the prosecutor. 

Cédric Jubillar has been described as someone who ""could be brutal, rude, aggressive"" ""including towards his children"".

612,gaycatdetective,1639605090,"On December 23, 2004, a decomposed skeleton was discovered by children in a barn near a wooded area near Tyler, Texas. At the time, all that could be determined was that it was a white male between 27 and 42 years old, and he had died earlier that year. 

DNA Doe Project announced that he has been identified as Kim Ryan Casey. Kim was apparently homeless and traveling, and was last known to be living in Coppell, Texas. Coppell is about 100 miles away from Tyler. Not much else is known about him at this time. He would have been 52 at the time of his death. There are no indications of criminal activity and authorities believe he died of natural causes due to the risks associated with being homeless and cold weather in the area around the time he died. 

DDP took on the case in 2019 after investigators had exhausted all investigative avenues. Bacteria contamination of the DNA sample and endogamy in portions of the family tree complicated the case, but Kim was identified as a potential match in August 2019 and confirmed last month. The NAMUS page was removed at that time. 

Other potential difficulties in identifying him could be that a photo provided of Kim shows he was balding, but a sketch was not created until sixteen years later, in2020, and it depicted him with a full head of long hair. He also had no personal items with him. It is unclear to me whether or not he was ever reported missing by anyone or not.

For those not familiar with the case the initial investigation did not indicate foul play in what was a tragic accidental death. Despite this the family of Mr. Johnson has quite literally raised hell for local law enforcement and the family of fellow students over an alleged cover up of Kendrick's supposed murder. 

While I sympathize with the family as I've recently lost my father at a young age and in a very unexpected fashion but the Johnson family has caused so much pain and hardship for others due to their excessive lawsuits and rage against others over what was a tragic but accidental death.

615,Apache1One,1639589475,"[Ruth Peck](https://imgur.com/a/IWOUl9Q) was an 81 year old Philadelphia woman who lived at 4712 Devereaux Street in the city’s Wissinoming neighborhood. Not much information is available for this case, the potential crime scene no longer exists (the homes on her block were demolished in the late 1990s), and no one knows for sure what caused [Ruth’s death](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/119978204/ruth-e-peck/photo), but considering the details, it is a fascinating case, so I figured I’d write something up with whatever information I could find. I grew up not far from here and had not heard of this case before I stumbled upon the [Ruthless podcast](www.ruthlessthepod.com) on Instagram (at ruthlessthepod).

Ruth Peck had not been heard from much on November 29, 1993. Since this was unusual, as Ruth interacted with family several times a day, a neighbor was asked to check on her. The neighbor found the front door unlocked and Ruth lying in her bed, lethargic and barely responsive. 

Later at the hospital, it was discovered that Ruth had a wound on the back of her head that suggested she fell into or was struck by a pointed object. Her son Joe states that the only sharp corner in the house that she could have fallen into was in her basement laundry room. He believes that she was struck, as she would not likely have been able to get to her bedroom herself due to her wounds as well as her severe arthritis. On January 23, 1994, Ruth Peck succumbed to her injuries. 

The autopsy report lists “accident” as the manner of death, “after she presumably fell, striking the back of her head.” However, page five of the report contains a note from a doctor stating “while in the hospital, she told a member of the staff that somebody hit her over the back of the head, but she didn’t know who.” A few pages further, a note from one of the doctors who treated her reads that he was “of the opinion that she was mugged.” 

Despite these assertions, it seems no police investigation took place, aside from a cursory visit to Ruth’s house. 

Her family believes there are two potential suspects. The first is a man who grew up in the house next door and remained there for a time after his parents died. He was suffering from drug addiction, and after his parents died, he sold much of what he could, down to the studs and then moved away. Ruth’s son believes he and the associates that were living with him were also engaging in petty crimes for cash. Right around the time of the attack, he re-emerged and stopped at Ruth’s home. They’d not seen one another in years. He invited her to Thanksgiving at his home, but she declined. Joe believes that if this neighbor attacked Ruth, the house would have been ransacked. He died several years ago. 

The second was Joe’s brother in law, his sister’s husband. Apparently the brother in law never got along with the family and was physically abusive with the sister on at least one occasion when Joe was present. The brother in law claimed health issues and did not work. Joe’s sister and husband moved into Ruth’s home after she died in 1994. While it is not known what could have precipitated an altercation between Ruth and the brother in law, there was animosity between the two. She would have opened the door to her home if he showed up on her doorstep, and more importantly, Tina, Ruth’s German Shepard would not need to be locked up if the brother in law visited because the dog was familiar with him. Joe believes his brother in law may have used a slag hammer Ruth kept to hit her over the head and then placed her in her bed before leaving and discarding the weapon. The brother in law died in October 2020, and his family denied knowing Ruth or anything about a hammer found amongst his possessions. 

So what happened? Was Ruth the victim of an unfortunate accident? Or was it a violent crime met with the indifference of a notoriously corrupt Philly Police Department due to Ruth’s advanced age?

Mr Draper was last seen leaving his workplace on Friday 3 August 2001 at Mount Pritchard Community Club, Mount Pritchard, NSW, Australia, driving his 1992 white Ford Falcon. A colleague was the last to see the bartender alive, leaving the car park at in the early hours of the morning. 

Mr Draper’s vehicle was later located at Leppington on Monday 17 September 2001, unlocked and undamaged, dumped outside a Rebels bikie clubhouse. It had been wiped clean, leaving detectives with no forensic evidence. A forensic examination of the vehicle was conducted; however, no further evidence was obtained.

Police confirmed that Mr Draper had not used or accessed his phone or bank accounts since his disappearance.

No one has been charged in relation to Mr Draper’s disappearance, and his body has never been located.

Police believe he was killed after witnessing a murder. The only possible explanation for Mr Draper's disappearance was a fatal bashing he witnessed while working at a Liverpool pub in 1995. Mr Draper was subsequently a Crown witness during the trial. He gave evidence against underworld figure Andrew Perish. Perish was cleared of that murder, but he and brother Anthony went on to plot and dismember police informant Terry Falconer. 

“I know there would be people out there who know exactly what happened with Ian,” homicide squad Commander Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty said. “We’re not looking just only for an arrest and conviction of those responsible for Ian’s disappearance and ultimate murder, but we also are trying to get some information about the remains of Ian - where the location might be.”

“I’ve got no doubt people know what happened to him and I got no doubt they know who was responsible.”

Ian’s mother, Janet Draper, said her family miss Ian more than words can express.

“Last week was Ian’s birthday and we have now spent 20 years without him, missing out on celebrating these milestones and many other special family occasions,” Mrs Draper said.

“Ian was a loving son, brother, uncle and friend and taken far too soon.

624,PM_ME_YOUR_DALEKS,1639530675,"There are many misconceptions regarding ""mysteries"" which involve the outdoors and different terrain. This summer there was yet another case which has prompted conspiracy theories and many comments of denial. Based on the newly released records and my experience as a hiker, I wanted to collect and rebut some of the myths about this ""mystery.""

**Background**
On Sunday, August 15, 2021, Ellen Chung, 31, Jonathan Gerrish, 45, their daughter, Aurelia ""Miju"" Chung-Gerrish, 1, and dog, Oski, left for a hike along the three-mile long Savage-Lundy Trail, in an area known as Devil's Gulch in the Sierra National Forest. They did not notify anyone of their plans that Sunday, though both adults texted on other, non-hiking matters up to the day prior. The last person to see the family in person on August 13, two days prior to their hike, was their unnamed nanny. 

Gerrish mapped the Sunday hike using the common app AllTrails that weekend. He had last hiked it himself in May 2017. The family were seen arriving at the trailhead in their vehicle around 7:45 a.m. on Sunday when the temperature was 76 degrees. Within three hours, the temperature rose to 99 and hit a peak of 109 that afternoon. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Gerrish was dressed in dark shorts, a yellow T-shirt and tennis shoes. Chung wore brown hiking boots, spandex shorts and a yellow tank top. The baby, dressed in a short-sleeved onesie and pink shoes, was strapped into a backpack on Gerrish’s back. 

No other witnesses have come forward as hiking the trail that day, so the family had the trail to themselves. I have read comments on forums that regular hikers in that area knew to avoid that trail in summer due to the hazardous heat, which would account for no other help being available. (The person who saw the family's truck drive by in the morning was walking her dog on the nearby road that leads to the trail parking lot, not on the trail). 

On Monday, August 16 at 11:00 am, the nanny arrived back at the Chung-Gerrish home for work and was surprised to find the family and their vehicle gone. The adults' wallets and cell phones were in the house, as was their regular diaper bag that they usually carried everywhere. The nanny called the couple's construction manager (they owned several properties in the area they were remodeling/renting). At first it was assumed the family had left on an errand, or perhaps to visit one of their properties. After friends called and drove around searching for the family without success, the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office was alerted at about 11:00 pm.

On the morning of Tuesday, August 17, authorities found the family's vehicle parked at the trailhead and proceeded to search the trail. Shortly after, the bodies of Gerrish, the baby and the dog were discovered together about 1.6 miles below the trailhead, on a series of steep switchbacks. The keyfob to their Ford truck was found about 100 feet below Gerrish, indicating he'd perhaps dropped it or thrown it. 

About an hour later, a deputy found disturbed dirt up the hill from Gerrish, the baby and the dog, as if someone had tried to crawl up the hill to the trailhead. He then found a shoe and finally the body of Chung about 13 feet from her family. The trail was shut down and, after authorities spent the day and night guarding the scene, the California Highway Patrol was able to airlift the bodies off the trail the next morning. 

Authorities used maps to locate any possible abandoned mine shafts in the area for toxic fumes, however there were none. There was no indication that the family had drunk from the nearest body of water, the Merced River, however authorities did test the water in it. They did find two different types of anatoxin-a, a neurotoxin, but that is a toxin that has never proven fatal to humans, only dogs who have ingested several liters. The drops of water remaining in the couple's empty water carrier were tested and were found to be tap water, so if they were aware of the river they could not get to it. Authorities even investigated the bodies and ground for indications of a fluke lightning strike. There was no indication of foul play. Autopsies determined the family died from hyperthermia and dehydration.

**Comments I've seen about the case**
*All living things do not succumb to heat at the same rate. A dog, a baby, and two adults would not die in the same place at the same time.*

There is no indication they succumbed at the same time. Chung was found about 13 feet up the hill from the rest of the family, with marks in the dirt indicating she had dragged herself up the hill, trying to get to the trailhead before succumbing. Sadly, hyperthermia impacts children at a rate three to five times faster than adults, so the baby likely started dying first. That would have panicked the parents and likely made them push themselves even more in the heat. It looks like when the baby started to die, they tried to push on until Gerrish (carrying the baby) could no longer go on either, so he stayed with the dog and the baby while Chung tried to go for help herself, before finally dying. 

*There was a full bottle of baby formula and water in the canteen.*
 
False. There were two empty sippy cups in the backpack found on Gerrish, one of which had formula residue in it. Chung had a 2.5 liter Osprey Hydraulics LT water bladder on her which was also empty, save for a few drops authorities were able to test (showing the water was clean and free of toxins). The Forest Service recommends for a hike like this at least 160 ounces of water per adult, 16 ounces for a baby and 16 ounces for a dog. The couple brought only 82 ounces of water total and likely went through that (plus the cup of formula) quickly. The only water source nearby was the Merced River, but there's no indication they were even aware of it.

*The couple were experienced hikers.*

This was repeated often in the press but there is nothing to back that up. They did enjoy occasional hikes but were not survivalists. When authorities interviewed friends, the construction manager had a low opinion of Gerrish's outdoor abilities (implying somewhat he was a city boy who tended to be easily bowled over by outdoor work). Gerrish's AllTrails app history showed that he had last hiked this same trail four year prior, in the spring when the weather was more temperate (and before wildfires had destroyed the trees). 

*The two adults could not have just suddenly lost all their senses in an instant.*

Confusion is one of the hallmarks of heat exhaustion/hyperthermia. Due to the temps, they likely started experiencing symptoms by late morning/midday. Once the baby started to succumb, that would have panicked them further. Without a cell signal, they would have realized that their only option was to try and get back to their vehicle. They were probably trying to go back during the peak of the heat in the afternoon, which would have made it worse. Resting would not have been an option for the adults when the baby was dying and needed rescue urgently. 

*They could have called for help. *

A cell phone was found in Gerrish's pocket, however that area has very poor cell reception. Authorities have tried but so far have been able to unlock the phone to see if there were any attempts made to call for help. 

*Their instinct would be to protect the child, whether under a shrub with its clothes off, pouring creek water on it, and at very least not holding the child close as it was found with the father. *

There was no shade on the trail due to the Ferguson Fire of 2018 which had burned off the tree canopy. The nearest water was the Merced River, which there was no indication they were aware of. The instinct would have been to get the baby medical help, not try and treat her on the trail. 

As for not holding the baby close because of body heat, there is little chance you could convince a parent to not offer physical comfort to their dying child. 

Here are some photos and a description of walking the trail in March 2015. Note this is before the wildfires destroyed the tree cover and even then, the writer notes they would never walk this trail in the summer:
https://sierranewsonline.com/hiking-on-the-savage-lundy-trail/

Then realize the family hiked this same trail in August, with all that shade cover gone. 

*The dog would have survived.* 

Oski was a Aussie-Akita mix, a dog bred for cold weather with a thick coat. He was also wearing a metal collar which would have conducted heat. We can presume that the couple, once they realized their dire lack of water, probably focused on giving it to the baby first so the dog likely got very little, if any. 

**What can this tragedy teach us?**
* Always, always know the area you're hiking in. Just because you visited an area some time before doesn't mean it has remained the same. Check with locals and those who actually live in the area. 
* Check the weather forecast and temps for the ENTIRE day(s), not just the time you expect to be on your hike. Realize that if something goes wrong you will be there beyond your forecasted window. Don't try to ""beat"" the weather. 
* Do not rely only on a cell phone in an emergency, which may not work in wilderness areas. 
* Always tell people where exactly you're going and when they can expect you back. Agree on a timeframe in which a trusted person will alert authorities if they've not heard from you. Whatever amount of water you think you'll need, take more. 
* Do not take children on hikes without being aware of their needs. Even if a baby isn't walking, they are still so small that the sun and temps will impact them much more quickly than an adult.

Five inches of fresh snow had fallen during the day of December 24, 1909, in the county of Powys, Wales. That evening at the farm of Owen Thomas and his family there was a happy Christmas Eve gathering with friends in attendance; everyone was roasting chestnuts and singing carols, and generally enjoying themselves. In attendance was not just the Thomases, but also several friends including the local minister and his wife.

        Around 11:00 PM, Mr. Thomas asked his 11-year-old son Oliver to fetch some more water from the well, as the bucket was getting low and it was a sure bet that the guests would still need more water to drink. Oliver put on his boots and overcoat, took the bucket, and walked out to get the water.

        Less than ten seconds later, the mood of the party was shattered by Oliver's screams for help.

        The minister grabbed a paraffin lantern as the group ran out the door to assist... but Oliver was nowhere to be seen. He could, however, still be heard; from somewhere above the groups' heads, Oliver screamed ""They've got me! They've got me!"" They flashed the lantern upwards, but could only see the black, starless sky... Oliver kept screaming, but the sound grew fainter and fainter. Eventually, the call faded away altogether.

        The snow in front of the group didn't help explain what happened. The deep new snow clearly displayed Oliver's footprints leading from the house towards the well; but about seventy-five feet away from the house, the tracks simply stopped. The wooden bucket was found about fifteen feet away from the last footprint in the snow. There were no other tracks or signs in the fresh snow to explain what happened.

        The following day saw the arrival of police officials from the nearby town of Rhayader, who formed a search party and scoured the countryside. The well was probed with grappling hooks; all who attended the party were fully interrogated... the simple evidence of Oliver's tracks in the snow told a story the police were not able to believe, so they attempted to find any other possible explanation for the boy's disappearance. But the evidence all pointed to the one impossible conclusion: Oliver had gone up, by means unknown... and that was all that could be said.

        No bird known in Wales -- or anywhere else -- is capable of lifting an eleven-year-old boy; and an airplane, which had only been properly invented about four years earlier, would have been easily heard over the boy's screams. Oliver was never seen again.

        Who, then, were the mysterious '*they*' that Oliver screamed about?

Described by her cousin as being [“She was very soft-spoken](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/we-just-want-to-know-what-happened-questions-remain-in-mysterious-death-of-yakama-woman/article_33515455-344f-58a5-afa6-f13973d91cab.html). She didn’t have a hostile bone in her body,” Doris said of Alice. “She was very sensitive.”’ [Alice Looney](https://uncovered.com/cases/alice-ida-looney) adored spending time with her nieces and nephews. She was a sister, aunt, cousin and friend. Growing up, Alice experienced bullying and struggled with depression as a result. 

**The last time Alice is seen.** On August 16, 2004, Alice ran into her sister, Mary and her husband at Legends Casino in Toppenish, Washington. Alice asked if they could take her to Wapato and drop her off at a nearby Roadrunner gas station. [Mary had warned her sister to be careful and remembered that Alice said she’d be cautious, and that she only had $20 in her pocket.](https://uncovered.com/cases/alice-ida-looney) 

However, it would be a few days before Mary would discover that Alice was missing because it wasn’t unusual for Alice to leave without giving any family or friends notice. Often for extended periods of time. Alice didn’t drive, so occasionally she would hitchhike. There were multiple alleged sightings of Alice with an unidentified man throughout Wapato.

**When she was discovered.** OnNovember 30, 2005, after searching for over a year, Alice’s remains were discovered by a hunter on a small island underneath a log in Satus Creek 23 miles from where she was last seen. An autopsy was done by forensic pathologists; however, they were unable to determine her cause of death. The examiner did note it is likely that the cause of death was “probable strangulation” [but didn’t have enough evidence to determine because of how much time elapsed since she went missing](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/we-just-want-to-know-what-happened-questions-remain-in-mysterious-death-of-yakama-woman/article_33515455-344f-58a5-afa6-f13973d91cab.html). 

In 2007, the [FBI took jurisdiction over Alice’s case along ](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/seattle/press-releases/2009/se050609-1.htm)with 15 other Native American women who went missing or were murdered near the Yakima Reservation in Washington. This investigation lasted two years and the findings were released in May 2009; 10 of the cases were homicides, 2 were accidental drownings, one was due to hypothermia. Meanwhile, Alice’s case was determined inconclusive. The investigation revealed that these deaths were not connected, nor was a serial killer involved

**Where the case stands today.**  Alice’s case is still unsolved, and her family still actively fights for answers. Were you near the Legends Casino, in Toppenish, Washington on August 16, 2004? Perhaps you stopped for gas at the Roadrunner later that night and saw Alice in Wapato?

628,eastofliberty,1639500394,"Toronto police have released video footage of a suspect who was seen on camera walking near the Sherman property for a ""suspicious amount of time"" at the time police believe the couple was murdered.
Police released the footage Tuesday four years after the 75-year-old founder of Canadian pharmaceutical company Apotex and his 70-year-old wife, who were among the country’s most well-known philanthropists, were murdered at their home on Old Colony Road.

Their bodies were discovered on the morning of Friday, Dec. 15, 2017 by a realtor who was showing the home to prospective buyers.

Speaking at a news conference at Toronto police headquarters on Tuesday morning. Det.- Sgt. Brandon Price told reporters that numerous peopl  were spotted on camera in the neighbourhood near the Sherman's property around the time of the murder, and with the exception of this one suspect, police have been able to identify all of those individuals.

""This individual's actions are highly suspicious,"" Price told reporters Tuesday, adding that the suspect stay in a ""defined area"" near the Sherman's property for some time.

Price did not rule out the possibility that this person could have a legitimate reason for being outside the Sherman home at the time of the murder but said they were around the property for a ""suspicious amount of time.""

In this case, it was just eleven teeth found, all believed to be from the same child, in a yard on F street. While one poster immediately thought of the skull found six years later, I immediately thought of Dorothea Puente and looked up the address of her house. Sure enough, it was the house right next door. Then I saw the found date matched up to when she was making headlines. 

Off to googling “Dorothea Puente Teeth” led me to another article that mentioned most of her victims were found without teeth, and two dozen teeth were thrown into her neighbor’s yard. 

So there you have it, there’s half a mouthful of an unidentified child’s teeth that almost certainly have something to do with Dorothea Puente. But whose teeth are they?

630,AlteredSportsHistory,1639455504,"Back in August 2016, when the concept of Instagram influencers was fairly new, a young Instagrammer from Paris named Louise Delage started gaining attention and notoriety with her colorful posts seemingly depicting a glamorous lifestyle. Delage was shown dancing at nightclubs, posing on yachts, eating at expensive restaurants—typical high-end influencer activities. Between her apparently trendy lifestyle, her stylish clothes, and—to be perfectly honest—[obvious good looks](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/who-louise-delage-troubling-truth-behind-overnight-instagram-success-173792/), Delage attracted over 66,000 followers in less than a month and a half.

However, one day Delage’s Instagram was abruptly cleared of all its pictures, replaced only by a brief silent film. The film showed in rapid succession all of her previous pictures, then asked the viewer what all the photos had in common. The commonality—which almost nobody had picked up on until then—was that every single one of her pictures showed Delage with some kind of alcoholic beverage: a glass of wine here, a cocktail there, even a bottle or two of champagne. “Louise Delage”, the film revealed, was actually an anti-alcoholism campaign composed by the French ad agency BETC for a charity called Addict Aide, which revealed how “normal” it might be for someone to be hiding their alcoholism in plain sight.

The “Like My Addiction” campaign, as it was known, was considered a huge success for both the ad agency, which won several awards in both North America and Europe, and for Addict Aide, which received a huge amount of publicity for its work. Remember, this was back in 2016, when Instagram was fairly new and people weren’t as cynical about influencers as they are now. Articles like [this one from Branding Mag](https://www.brandingmag.com/2016/10/02/good-campaign-of-the-week-addict-aide-like-my-addiction/) and [this from Medium](https://medium.com/@shuyi.wong/like-my-addiction-by-betc-4cf01974dc1a) lavished praise on both BETC and the campaign. 

And it seemed that “Like My Addiction” might not be the last word from either the campaign or Louise Delage herself. Later interviews with the creators of the campaign suggested that a future campaign might focus on Delage in rehab, and a longer film was said to be potentially on the table. However, after 2017, chatter about the campaign and Louise Delage seemed to stop entirely. All the creators of the project seemed to move on to other things…including the model who portrayed “Louise Delage”. 

Curiously, even after the big reveal, the creators of the campaign never mentioned who Louise Delage actually was. None of the articles mentioned a name, and nobody seemed to even ask the question. It seemed strange that someone who had received so much publicity on Instagram, so fast, could vanish just as quickly without anyone knowing who she was…or without anyone even seeming interested in who she was.

I was thinking about this campaign the other day when I saw another internet anti-alcoholism campaign. I thought by now that “Louise Delage”’s identity would have been revealed by now, and maybe she went on to some other acting or modeling career. But there have been almost no articles about the campaign since 2017, and none of the articles mentioned anything. So I started writing this post to ask the question….

…and then, just as I was almost finished writing this, I Googled “Louise Delage imdb” out of curiosity.

[Hmmmm.](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5041601/)

I mean…that’s got to be her, right? It certainly looks like her. And the IMDB profile describes somebody who would have a little bit of acting and modeling experience and a lot of experience putting together photo shoots—in other words, exactly the sort of person who could have put together dozens of influencer Instagram pictures in a short amount of time.

But on the other hand…if you’re trying to put together a mysterious Instagram campaign where the whole idea is to depict an anonymous “could be anyone” person on the internet, wouldn’t the last name you pick be the *actual name* of the person in the photographs? And why the continued secrecy? IMDB profiles usually include *everything* somebody has been involved in. Surely the “Like My Addiction” campaign would have be part of her profile, especially considering that the campaign ended with a brief, but award-winning film...and surely, now that the ""real"" Louise Delage is a rising star herself with costume design credits on *The French Dispatch* and *Boite Noire*, that connection would be out in the open?

So, like the Instagram influencer’s alcoholism, was Louise Delage hiding in plain sight all this time? Or is there another surprise behind the glamour?",UnresolvedMysteries,"Who was “Louise Delage”, the Instagram influencer who was later revealed to be the subject of an anti-alcoholism campaign?",0

His father went to investigate this, and just after that Stanley arrived at the house.

633,cryptenigma,1639426198,"Short summary: police find body of Mississippi woman missing since 2007 after her brother-in-law confessed to her murder, and revealed where he hid the body, prior to his execution for estranged wife, Kim Cox.

From https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/remains-found-after-pre-execution-tip-from-mississippi-man/ :

""On Sunday, police discovered what’s believed to be the body of Felicia Cox on land that had once belonged to her family in Pontotoc County. The remains will be taken to the state crime lab for an autopsy and DNA testing to confirm identity, according to Pontotoc County Coroner Kim Bedford.

Last month, David Neal Cox became the first inmate executed in Mississippi in nine years, put to death for killing his estranged wife, Kim Kirk Cox, and sexually assaulting her young daughter as her mother lay dying. Cox pleaded guilty in 2012 to capital murder for the May 2010 shooting death. He also pleaded guilty to multiple other charges, including sexual assault.

Cox had dropped his appeals, filing court papers calling himself “worthy of death” before the state Supreme Court set his execution date.

Questions had remained about whether David Cox was responsible for the 2007 disappearance of Felicia Cox, his brother’s wife, who was last seen in a neighboring county...Before his Nov. 17 execution, David Cox told his attorneys he killed Felicia Cox in 2007, providing detailed instructions on where investigators could find her remains and waiving his attorney-client privilege after death, according to John Weddle, the district attorney for several northern Mississippi counties.

The information was presented to Weddle’s office two days after Cox’s execution, the district attorney said last week, adding that David Cox has been a longtime suspect in his sister-in-law’s disappearance.

'Our office is greatly indebted to many as we reflect on the discovery of what appears to be the remains of Felicia Cox today in Pontotoc County,' Weddle said Sunday in a statement posted to his official Facebook page. 'We are thankful the family can now begin the process of giving Felicia Cox a burial.'

637,annemoriarty,1639411516,"- Hypothesis on the alleged instigators


The investigations subsequently led to hypothesize the existence of instigators of the crimes. This hypothesis is based on some statements by Giancarlo Lotti (who declared in the trial that the body parts were bought by an unknown ""doctor"") and on the discovery of a possible esoteric symbol, a pyramid trunk of colored granite, about fifteen centimeters long, found a few meters from the lifeless bodies of the couple killed in October 1981. However, it should be remembered that this object is often used as a doorstop in the Tuscan countryside. Other alleged evidence of a possible magical-esoteric motive occurred on the occasion of the last crime; a few days before being murdered the two victims had camped in the Calenzano area but were asked to leave by a gamekeeper, as free camping was not allowed in that area. Later the same gamekeeper found, not far from the place where the two had camped for the first time, three stone circles, two of which were open and one closed and conteined berries, burnt animal skins and wooden crosses. However, the episode of the gamekeeper was recently disputed. In fact, the presence of the couple in Calenzano didn't appear from the receipts that the couple used to keep during their travels; furthermore, all possible sightings of the French couple deserve reflection and the benefit of the doubt. This is due to the fact that the photo of the French victim that ended up in the newspapers showed the woman with very short hair, while in September '85 Nadine had long hair.
Moreover, the frequentations of Pacciani and Vanni during the years of the murders fueled a stream of inquiry into possible esoteric motives and rites linked to Satanism. In particular, Pacciani and Vanni frequented a man called Salvatore Indovino, a magician and fortune teller originally from Catania. They usually spent time together at a farmhouse located in the countryside of San Casciano, where, according to many, orgies and rites connected to occultism were consumed. During the searches carried out by the State Police at Pacciani's home, at least three books were found that can be linked to black magic and Satanism. The so-called esoteric lead is also linked to the large sums of money that Pacciani came into possession during the years of the crimes, from which the idea was born that the ""snack companions"" acted on behalf of unknown personalities interested in deriving ""fetishes"" from mutilated bodies. Pacciani, a modest farmer, came to have 157 million lire (corresponding, in 1996, to 117,069.52 euros in 2018) in cash and interest-bearing postal bonds, as well as having bought a car, two houses and renovated completely his home.
The investigation carried out by the State Police showed that Pacciani, before the crimes attributable to the Monster, was in economically modest conditions and did not inherit assets that could justify the sums of money considered (but not by all) too large and sudden for a simple farmer. Mario Vanni also came to have important figures, albeit to a much lower extent. Those who do not believe in the instigators hypotesys point out that the farmer, in addition to renting an apartment, carried out many illegal jobs and was known for his stinginess. Furthermore, the alleged accomplice Lotti was far from rich since in the eighties and nineties he found jobs and accommodation only thanks to the help of the village priest, being in effect a destitute unemployed person. Vanni, despite the figures found on his accounts, died in a modest retirement home in the province. The esoteric motive is thus dismissed by many investigators.


The sentences condemning the ""snack companions"" are mainly based on the discussed testimonies of Pucci and, above all, of Lotti. This prevented the identification of a certain, organic motive that was valid for all crimes. In fact Lotti, before mentioning the mysterious ""doctor"", had changed his version several times on the reasons why Pacciani and Vanni had killed. Lotti initially declared in 1996 ""that the crimes had been acts of anger over sexual approaches that the victims would have rejected"". Then, a year later, he provided another version of the motive, stating that Pacciani's will was to kill and then feed the ""fetishes"" to his daughters.  The debate on Lotti's reliability remains open in public opinion, despite the fact that he was decisive in obtaining definitive judicial sentences on the matter. In 2010 Pier Luigi Vigna, former prosecutor of Florence who dealt with the case, declared himself skeptical about the existence of possible instigators. Piero Tony, deputy attorney general at the appeal trial against Pacciani, also was skeptical of the  hypothesis.
But from a legal standpoint the mystery of the Monster of Florence was officially resolved.


- Suspect: Francesco Narducci 


Francesco Narducci was a doctor and university professor, he belonged to one of the wealthiest and most prominent families of Perugia. He died in Lake Trasimeno at the age of 36, on October 13, 1985, a few weeks after the last crime of the Monster of Florence. His death, at the time, was filed as a accidental drowning and the body was buried without an autopsy. It has been hypothesized that he was responsible for the crimes, on the basis of a retracted testimony of a maid who allegedly saw him write a confession asking for forgiveness and in recent times on the basis of one of the controversial ""spontaneous declarations"" of the criminal Angelo Izzo. Maybe he was one of the leaders of the mysterious ""sect"" that allegedly commissioned the murders. His involvement was initially based on the wiretapping of a group of criminals who allegedly threatened a woman called ""Dora"", tellinge her that they would ""do to her the same thing they did to the doctor killed in Lake Trasimeno "" and on the basis of some anonymous letters received from investigators in the following months, in which the doctor was linked to the murders. Later, other threatening phone calls addressed to ""Dora"" were intercepted: in one of these a female voice referred, in addition to the alleged murder of Narducci, to the ""murder of Pacciani"". According to the person on the phone, both murders were allegedly committed by members of a ""satanic sect"", because the victims were guilty of having betrayed them.
Statements by people informed about the facts and anomalies in the investigations on the corpse led to the hypothesis that Narducci had been murdered. In 2002 the body was exhumed, on which autopsy tests showed the presence of lesions compatible with strangulation; some hypothesized the involvement of a Masonic lodge, to which Narducci's father belonged. According to Ugo Narducci, on the other hand, his son Francesco voluntarily took his own life after he was diagnosed with a serious health problem. At the time, however, the official version of the family was that of the misfortune. 


- Suspect: Francesco Calamandrei


In 1988 Mariella Ciulli, ex wife of Francesco Calamandrei, a pharmacist from San Casciano, went to the Carabinieri and reported that a few years earlier, when she was still married to the man, she had found a pistol in the house, precisely a Beretta.  She had also found  some macabre fetishes in the refrigerator. The Carabinieri immediately carried out a search of Calamandrei's house, but found nothing unusual. In 1991, the woman went to the Carabinieri again to provide new information. According to Mariella Ciulli, on the night of August 21, 1968, she was in a car together with her husband, in the vicinity of Castelletti di Signa (theater of the double murder Lo Bianco-Locci), when they both heard shots. The two then saw a child and brought him to safety. Ciulli also declared that her husband used to hang out with bad people (including Pacciani, Vanni and Lotti), and that, on the night of the last murders, he returned home with face wounds; she later revealed that he was the owner of various weapons, which he then threw into the sea, shortly after the last crime. The Carabinieri searched the pharmacist's home again, but again they found nothing suspicious. Due to her unsupported revelations, Ciulli was soon taken as unreliable, moved by the desire to take revenge on her husband who had left her for another woman with whom he had later remarried. Later, repeated subsequent complaints against her ex-husband were not even taken into consideration by the police.
On January 16, 2004 the head of the Florence police, Michele Giuttari, in charge of re-examining the case, asked Prosecutor Paolo Canessa for a warrant to search the pharmacist's house again. On January 20, 2004, the search took place. On May 21, 2008, at the end of a trial with an abbreviated procedure which began in September 2007, Calamandrei, accused of being the instigator of the crimes, was acquitted of the charges . He died in 2012 at the age of 71.


- Hypothesis of the solitary serial killer linked to the Sardinian lead


 A thesis followed in recent years and profiled, for example, by the English writer Magdalen Nabb and by the journalist Mario Spezi, is that the Monster was an individual linked to the ""Clan of the Sardinians"", already investigated in the events of the serial killings. The thesis in question starts from the reconstruction of the first murder in 1968, considering it actually committed for sentimental and ""honor"" reasons by subjects linked to the Mele and Vinci families. However, the Monster could be completely unrelated to this affair, having only subsequently appropriated the gun and ammunition to start the serial chain of murders. According to this hypothesis, only a member of the families involved in the first crime of 1968 could have appropriated the pistol and bullets, as it is completely unlikely that the owner would transfer a weapon and a box of ammunition already used in a murder to a stranger.
According to the aforementioned journalist and writer, the murders are attributable to a single person, a serial killer who always acted alone. It should be emphasized that their suspect ""Carlo"", aka the Monster of Florence, was alleged to be a man born in 1959 and that at the time of the first crime he was only 9 years old. Mario Spezi and Douglas Preston specify that they never held ""Carlo"" responsible for the 1968 crime and that he was arrested in September 1983 for detention and receiving stolen arms, about a week after the murder of the two German boys, but was acquitted. He only ended up in prison again in 1988, three years after the last double murder. The real name of ""Carlo"" has been removed from the Italian version of the book, but it was present in the first edition in English. 


- Hypothesis of the serial killer in uniform


 Another important hypothesis is that expressed by the lawyer Nino Filastò. The writer-lawyer, who has been investigating the Monster since the early eighties, in addition to having been Mario Vanni's lawyer, tried to prove the innocence of the ""snack companions"" with a global analysis of the whole affair. In his book the inconsistencies in the testimony of Giancarlo Lotti are highlighted and the methods of investigation are criticized. The lawyer compares the figure of Lotti to that of Stefano Mele: both were intellectually very modest and suggestible, but due to an incorrect (according to Filastò) investigative trail, they became leading characters in two different periods of the investigations. 
In his hypothesis the Monster is a lust murder type serial killer suffering from a serious sexual pathology, active at least from 1968 to 1993 and whose name never entered the investigation. Some elements, such as the registration document found out of place in the car of a murdered couple, or the Monster's ability to easily approach the cars, lead the lawyer to frame the killer as a ""man in uniform"". Someone who might be able to interact with the investigations and even know and anticipate some of the investigators' moves. Radical is also Filastò's criticism of the ""esoteric"" and ""instigators"" hypotesys, considered anti-historical and criminologically incompatible with serial crimes of a manic nature. In fact, Filastò considers absurd and grotesque the hypothesis of a sect or an organization that used the ""snack companions"" as laborers.


- Hypothesis Zodiac 


 In an investigation conducted by the journalist Francesco Amicone, published between 2018 and 2021 it is claimed that the US serial killer Zodiac is the Monster of Florence. According to Amicone, the serial killer was Giuseppe ""Joe"" Bevilacqua, born in Totowa, New Jersey, on December 20, 1935. Bevilacqua, a witness to the Pacciani trial, lived and worked at the American cemetery in Florence in San Casciano from July 1974 to late 1988, a few hundred meters from the site of the last crime attributed to the Monster. Prior to the publication of the investigation, Amicone reported a series of talks he had with him in Florence. Bevilacqua allegedly admitted his guilt in the crimes committed by the Monster and the Zodiac. Bevilacqua, according to the investigation, is the same individual that Mario Vanni identified with the name ""Ulysses, the American"". In addition to allegedly putting his name and surname in a cipher, Bevilacqua allegedly signed his crimes and his letters making allusions to the Italian word ""water"" (acqua), contained in his surname. A similar reference to water is also found in the magazine clippings used to compose the Monster's letter to Silvia Della Monica. Bevilacqua, in 2018, threatened lawsuits, replying that he had never confessed.
In an article published on April 23, 2021, Amicone detailed the telephone conversation that took place with Bevilacqua on September 11, 2017. Allegedly, after the admissions, Bevilacqua was in the process of turning himself in and carrying the gun used in the crimes of the Monster, before changing his mind after hearing a lawyer. The article provides further insight into the suspect's past, such as his 20-year military background in the United States Army, his participation as a CID agent in the Khaki Mafia investigations at in the 1960s, (which is why he was in San Francisco around the time of Zodiac's activity). After the discharge from the army and the transfer to the American cemetery in Florence, the former CID agent allegedly started to perpetrate his crimes in the surroundings of Florence. 
Italian authorities collected Bevilacqua's DNA in late 2020.


- Hypothesis ""Rosso del Mugello""


  Another alternative hypothesis identified in the man seen by Baldo Bardazzi - and by numerous other witnesses in the town of Vicchio - as the one and only murderer of the couples. As already mentioned in the chapter dedicated to the murder of Pia Rontini and Claudio Stefanacci, the man in question was tall (175-180 cm (5,9 ft)), robust and balding with reddish-blond hair. The hypothesis of the so-called ""Rosso del Mugello"" is particularly supported by the documentary maker Paolo Cochi. In 2021 there have been numerous updates on this theory, given that the man in question appears to have been identified (by Cochi himself) in a old report by the Carabinieri (never disclosed to the public and found in the numerous files of the investigation) which identified a man with the same physiognomic elements (tall, robust, balding with reddish-blond hair) as suspected of being the author of a theft of a Beretta caliber 22 series 70 which took place in an armory in Borgo San Lorenzo in 1965, as well as the author of the series of crimes of the Monster. The subject in question was interrogated and searched after the crime in Vicchio and was found in possession of Winchester 22-gauge cartridges with H embossed on the caseback. The personal details of the man have not been disclosed to the public for obvious reasons of privacy , but Paolo Cochi has repeatedly repeated that the man worked within the judicial environment, however, without specifying his profession. At the end of 2020, Rosanna De Nuccio (sister of Carmela De Nuccio, killed by the Monster in 1981) instructed the lawyer Antonio Mazzeo to carry out investigations regarding the murder of his sister, as no guilty party was found for this murder.
The lawyer Antonio Mazzeo appointed the documentary maker Paolo Cochi as a consultant and asked the President of the Court of Assizes of Florence for the documents concerning the murder, as well as documents concerning other murders in the series. The aforementioned President authorizes access to these documents. After the analysis of the various documents, Mazzeo and Cochi decided to ask for access to further documents concerning - in addition to the De Nuccio-Foggi murder - the criminal record and photos of the man identified by the Carabinieri in the file never disclosed to the public. The request for access to the documents this time was sent directly to the Prosecutor Luca Turco who, on February 4, 2021, denied access to these documents and also revoked access to the documents concerning the De Nuccio - Foggi murders. 
This denial, according to the lawyer Mazzeo, was absolutely unjustified for a number of reasons. This refusal has sparked numerous controversies on the part of those interested in the ""Rosso del Mugello"" lead and has also led two politicians to present some queries. The Minister of Justice Marta Cartabia responded by confirming the refusal of the Prosecutor, stating that his conduct is in compliance with the rules of the current Code.


- Recent developments


In 2018 the discovery of a genetic trace not attributable to the victims was announced. It was found on a forgotten artifact of the last crime, a bloody handkerchief, found in a bush together with surgeon's gloves. In 1985 Professor Riccardo Cagliesi (of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Florence) had drawn up a report of 13 pages, indicating that the material was human blood of group B (compatible for example with the blood group of Mario Vanni but not with that of Pacciani) and there was also a fragment of human hair, brown in color. This find was then forgotten, until 2018.
In 2019, an expert report was released according to which the Monster's weapon may not have been the famous Beretta 22 caliber but a modified firearm or another 22 caliber, or the Beretta itself but with the barrel replaced.
In 2021, the Scientific Police carried out an inspection in one of the murder sites with the aim of looking for new clues using modern technologies that did not exist at the time of the crimes. 


- Suspect: Giampiero Vigilanti


Giampiero Vigilanti, a former legionnaire, born in 1930 in Vicchio del Mugello was entered in the register of suspects in 2017; he knew Pacciani and, according to him, in 1948 he had a quarrel and a physical fight with him. He had already been searched in September 1985, three days before the first search at Pacciani's house and a few days after the last crime, following the report of some neighbors who indicated him as the possible responsible for the crimes. In fact his car resembled the one seen when the identikit was made. Some newspaper clippings on the crimes were found in his home; he was acquainted with almost all the people involved in various ways in the investigations, including the ""snack companions"", the Sardinians and Narducci; in the 1950s he had fought in Indochina with the French foreign legion in which he was enlisted in 1952. Marshal Antonio Amore, who searched him for the first time, saw a photo in his house where Vigilanti was posing next to beheaded corpses of enemies, and with a severed head in his hand. Vigilanti claimed to have killed 300-500 enemies during the Indochina War. After leaving the legion in 1960, he worked as an extra in cinema, opened a nightclub in Marseille, did various jobs and then worked in a funeral home in Prato until his retirement.


A 1984 a witness had said that a person observed the victims Claudio Stefanacci and Pia Rontini with insistence before the crime; this man was described as a tall, robust person, elegantly dressed, and with a large ring on his finger, like the legionary ring worn by Vigilanti, who, invited to attend the funeral, did not come. However, the original ring was lost. The legionnaire was not investigated, although in 1986 he was on the same list of 38 suspects drawn up by the police and by Perugini's SAM (Vigilanti at number 38, Pacciani at number 31). Vigilanti stated in 2017 that Pia Rontini was killed ""for refusal"", and was being harassed by a doctor. Nine years later, in 1994, due to a quarrel with a neighbor, he underwent a second search and 176 bullets of the same brand as those used in the crimes were found, but the investigations did not lead to anything and Vigilanti was cleared. For the eight double murders, given Vigilanti's proximity to the far right, a new lead was hypothesized linked to the ""strategy of tension"" in Italy under which crimes were committed to distract the magistrates from the political subversive activity of the time. In 1998, the year of Pacciani's death, Vigilanti made a comeback by participating in a television program where he claimed to have had a large inheritance from ""Joe"", an unidentified American uncle. The hypothesis was then resumed in 2017 after a complaint by lawyer Vieri Adriani, lawyer for the family of victim Nadine Mauriot. However, the head of the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately denied that the ongoing investigations had revealed evidence linking the crimes to possible subversive environments. Vigilanti was however investigated for complicity in murder for all eight crimes. He plead innocent but said he knew some information. 
Following this statements, Francesco Caccamo (an 86-year-old doctor from Mugello enrolled in Freemasonry) was indicated by Vigilanti (who also stated that Pacciani and Vanni were innocent) as responsible. Both were entered in the register of suspects but from the search at the doctor's home there was no confirmation of this thesis. Vigilanti owned a 22 caliber Beretta, which was not found to be the murder weapon in 1994. He reported the theft of the gun in 2013 along with other pistols. In 2019 Vigilanti was reported for domestic abuse by his wife. In September 2019, the Prosecutor asked for the filing of Vigilanti and Caccamo due to the insufficiency elements collected against them in the preliminary investigation phase.

- (6) Horst Wilhelm Meyer and Jens-Uwe Rüsch (Giogoli - Friday, September 9, 1983) 


On 9 September 1983, in Giogoli, two German boys were murdered. They were Jens-Uwe Rüsch and Horst Wilhelm Meyer, both 24, students at the University of Münster who were in their van at the time of the attack, with the radio on. The boys were reached and killed by seven bullets fired through the van, but only 4 shells of the 7 were found. The investigations following the crime established that the shots were fired from a height of about 1,3 to 1,5 meters from the ground, which suggests that the killer was at least 1.80 meters (5,9 ft) tall, or even more. However, the hypothesis of the killer's height being above average is not shared by everyone. The murderer first killed Meyer with three shots in very rapid succession, while Rüsch tried in vain to escape but was then also hit by four bullets. Once the two young men were killed, the murderer got on the back of the van but, realizing that the victims were both male, he disappeared without using sidearms and carrying out any excision on the bodies. In this case, the killer was perhaps misled by Rüsch's long hair and slender build, who was probably mistaken for a woman. The victims' money and cameras were not taken, nor did any valuables appear to be missing.


It was therefore thought that the murderer, who couldnt be Stefano Mele (he was in jail) nor Francesco Vinci, could instead be another person belonging to their circle of acquaintances. Giovanni Mele (Stefano's brother) and Piero Mucciarini (Giovanni Mele's brother-in-law) were therefore indicted and investigated. Piero Mucciarini and Giovanni Mele remained detained for eight months on charges of being the perpetrators of the double murders. The two were then released from prison, and quickly got out of the investigation definitively, as there was no evidence against them that would justify their indictment. Above all, the two were in prison during the period in which the murder of Claudio Stefanacci and Pia Rontini was committed. For a certain period Salvatore Vinci, Francesco's brother was also investigated for the murders. Stefano Mele died in 1995 of a heart attack following surgery, while residing in a hospice for ex-prisoners.


- (7) Claudio Stefanacci and Pia Rontini (Vicchio - Sunday, July 29, 1984)


The victims of the penultimate crime were Claudio Stefanacci (21-year-old university student) and 18-year-old Pia Gilda Rontini (employed at a bar and majorette in the musical band). The car of the young couple was parked at the end of a secluded road against the embankment of a hill. When attacked, the couple were half-naked in the back seat of the car. The murderer shot through the glass of the right door hitting the boy four times (including one in the head), and twice the girl who had tried to escape (one bullet in the back and one in the forehead). Subsequently the murderer raged with several stabs to the bodies, hitting Pia twice in the throat and Claudio a dozen times. The girl's pubis and left breast were removed. The chain she wore was torn off and the cross-shaped pendant was removed. In this case the handbag was neither searched nor tampered with, presumably because it was hidden under the passenger seat.
The boy's mother, worried about the delay, went to look for him at his friends' house who, knowing his habits, went to look for him where they knew he was staying, thus discovering the corpses. Also in this case it seems that the female victim had suffered harassment by unknown people in the days preceding the crime. A friend of Pia's reported receiving a phone call from the young woman, very shortly before the crime, in which Pia told her that in the bar where she worked ""there were unpleasant people with whom she felt very insecure"". This fact seemed to be corroborated by Baldo Bardazzi, his father Piero and his sister, (managers of a diner in San Piero a Sieve) who declared that they recognized the couple. In fact the couple, in the afternoon of July 29 (around 4:45 pm, a few hours before the murder) were at their diner. Immediately after them, according to Bardazzi, a ""distinguished gentleman"" arrived, about 40/45 years old, tall, burly, with an intense and gruff look, in a suit and tie, with blond or reddish hair. He ordered a beer and sat outside, scrutinizing with intensity and anger the couple who was inside the diner. As soon as the young couple had eaten their meal and approached the cashier to pay, the man, who had taken half an hour to consume half a glass, drank the rest of the beer in one go and followed them. Bardazzi, at the request of the Carabinieri, participated to the funeral of the victims with the intention of identifying  the man seen at his diner, but he didn't recognize him.


Identikit made by Baldo Bardazzi (1984): https://images.app.goo.gl/VgWpFK7XAXex8oPbA


A man with a similar physiognomy was seen, about two Saturdays before the crime, by Emanuela Bazzi, Pia's colleague at the bar where she worked. In particular, the man was described as tall, robust, balding with reddish-blond hair, with a full face and with a Tuscan dialect, around 45 years old. In a testimony, Bazzi reported that she had recognized the man in question because, prior to the murder of Pia and Claudio, he had annoyed a girl who went into the bar to get an ice cream. The man, who knew where the teenager was staying, asked her: ""Are you still camped up there?"". Receiving an affirmative answer, he also asked her: ""So I'm coming to see you tonight?"". The girl replied nervously: ""No, I'm not there tonight."" Bazzi stated that the young woman was so upset that she didn't even take her change and left quickly. The day before the murder the same man, after ordering a coffee, bothered Bazzi herself, asking her: ""Manuela, are you going dancing?"". Annoyed, she gave him a negative answer. Pia's colleague asked for news about this stranger, learning that he was from Scarperia. Bazzi was not asked to make any identikit, however she saw the identikit made by Bardazzi, stating that the man she saw resembled the subject depicted. 
Another colleague of Pia's, Luciana Lelmi, also saw a man for the first time on July 22, 1984, describing him as robust, very balding with straight blond hair and a Tuscan accent, around 45 years old. According to Lelmi, the subject in question did not appear completely normal when he spoke and had the characteristic of scrutinizing people eagerly from top to bottom. She was shown Bardazzi's identikit and said that the man depicted resembled the subject she noticed, asserting, however, that she did not know him. The man was last seen by Lelmi on August 1, 1984, three days after the crime, when he entered the bar to have a coffee. However, on this occasion, he did not have any kind of interaction with the people in the bar, not showing harassing attitudes. After consuming his coffee, the man left and was never  seen again.
This person was also seen by two other witnesses: Franco L. and Tiziana S. . Franco reported having seen, on the evening of July 28 or 29, around 8 pm at the same bar, a very distinguished man, with a serious look: tall, robust, balding with short light hair, who came in to have a coffee; the witness saw the identikit and considered the man he had seen to be very similar to the one depicted. Tiziana, on the other hand, claimed to have seen him on July 14. She described him as a man about 40/45 years old, tall, distinguished, robust, with a slightly oval face, balding with light brown or reddish-blond hair. He was behind a bush on the bank of the river Sieve, about ten meters from the entrance to the road where the crime took place, spying on the people who were fishing and sunbathing. Suddenly, those present were alarmed by the fall of a stone and all turned to the man who, noticing that he was being watched, disappeared .


Another witness was a security guard, Nicola Esposito, who saw a man with the same physical characteristics. In the summer of 1981 the security guard was having a coffee at a bar located in Calenzano, when he was approached by a man who was drinking a beer at the counter. The man asked Esposito questions about his weapon and, shortly after, he took out three .22 Long Rifle bullets (with H embossed on the caseback, they were old and oxidized) and asked: ""Do you want them? at home I have another 500 or 600 "". Esposito took them, put them in his pocket and left. The security guard describes the man as tall (about 180 cm, 5,9 ft), robust, with a little belly and with broad shoulders, round face, reddish cheeks, balding with very short hair pulled back of a reddish-blond color, without beard or mustache; the accent was Tuscan, not accentuated. 
Another friend of Pia Rontini said that in the week before the crime, while he was driving the girl home in his car after the evening shift, he had noticed that he had been followed a couple of times by an amaranth or faded red mid-size car. There were also numerous sightings, in the week before the murder, of an amaranth red Renault car parked with only one person on board, near the area where the couple was killed. Bardazzi was heard by prosecutor Canessa, who highlighted some inconsistencies in his testimony, as the timing of the movement of the couple was not precise and in addition Bardazzi himself  at the trial did not prove so certain that he had recognized the couple. However, in multiple testimonies Bardazzi said he was sure that the couple he saw were Pia and Claudio, as they were also recognized by his father and sister in the immediacy of the fact and also because the couple had parked a light-colored Fiat Panda near the venue, just like Claudio's car. The couple, according to Bardazzi, were not new faces and had already come to the diner other times. 


- (8) Jean-Michel Kraveichvili and Nadine Mauriot (Scopeti - Sunday, September 8, 1985)


The last double murder took place in the countryside of San Casciano, in the hamlet of Scopeti, inside a pitch adjacent to a cemetery and surrounded by cypresses, where couples used to seclude themselves. The victims were two young French: Jean-Michel Kraveichvili (a 25-year-old musician) and 36-year-old Nadine Mauriot (owner of a shoe shop, mother of two young girls, recently separated from her husband); both were from Audincourt, a town in eastern France. The victims were camped in a small tent just off the road. The murder was traced by some to the night of September 8, by others to the night before, a consideration that was motivated by the presence on the corpses of fly larvae who need at least 25 hours of time to develop.
The methods of the attack were similar to those previously put into practice by the murderer, except that, in this case, the victims were not in the car but in a tent pitched near their car: the murderer, after having severed with a knife the outer fabric of the tent on the back, moved towards the entrance of the tent and shot. Nadine died immediately; Jean-Michel, not mortally wounded, managed to get out of the tent and fled to the woods, but was reached by the murderer who  stabbed him and then hid his body among some rubbish in a place not far from the tent. After being extracted from the tent in order to carry out mutilations on the pubis and on the left breast, the woman's corpse was also somehow hidden and rearranged inside the tent so that it was not immediately visible.
This particular modus operandi suggests that the murderer had the intention of delaying the discovery of the bodies as much as possible. Added to this is the fact that the murderer explicitly wanted to challenge the investigators: between September 7 and September 9 he sent a letter containing a flap of Nadine Mauriot's left breast. The letter was delivered to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Florence on September 10. The prosecutor Silvia Della Monica, who since the early months of 1984 had delegated the investigations to colleagues to deal with other cases, was the recipient of the macabre correspondence. On the front of the envelope, in addition to a stamp depicting the Castle of Bosa, the following sentence was written, with letters cut from a newspaper: ""DOTT. DELLA MONICA SILVIA PROCURA DELLA REPUBLICA 50I00 FLORENCE"" [Doctor Monica Silvia prosecutor's office]. Note that the word ""Repubblica"" [republic] was written with a missing letter B and the number 1 of the postal code ""50100"" was written with a capital letter I. The murderer used a dextrin-based glue to glue the newspaper letters and the stamp, while to seal the letter he did not use saliva, but a common glue. Inside the envelope there was a sheet folded on itself and carefully glued along the edges; inside this sheet lied a polyethylene bag containing the aforementioned breast flap. For 35 years it was not known which magazine the Monster used to cut out the letters. However, in 2020 the magazine was identified as the magazine ""Gente"" number 51 on newsstands from December 14 to 20, 1984. 


The letter: https://images.app.goo.gl/LmWsggTtBYy85ii1A


In addition to the letter sent to Della Monica, other letters also arrived at the Prosecutor's Office in Florence: on October 1 two anonymous envelopes were delivered, addressed to the deputy prosecutors Paolo Canessa and Francesco Fleury. These letters contained a photocopy of an article from the newspaper ""La Nazione"" dated September 29, 1985, entitled ""The Monster made another error"" and with the subtitle ""on the night of the crime all roads were checked and his car may have been reported by a toll collector "". On the edge of the photocopy there was the following text written with a typewriter: ""one each is enough"". Inside the envelope, in addition to the newspaper article, there was a sheet of paper on which a surgical glove finger containing a Winchester brand cartridge 22 with ""H"" embossed on the caseback had been stapled. On October 5 another letter arrived in the prosecutor's office, addressed to the deputy prosecutor Piero Luigi Vigna. Inside the pouch there were full surgical gloves and a glove finger containing a Winchester brand cartridge .22 caliber with ""H"" imprinted on the caseback  On all three letters the recipient's name and address had been typed. 
The biological tests showed that on the flaps of the envelopes there were traces of saliva that belong to a subject with blood group A. However, there is no certainty that this two last letters were sent by the murderer, since they did not contain any real evidence. The breast shred sent to the prosecutor remains the only unequivocal ""message"" sent by the Monster to the investigators. In modern times, a genetic report by prof. Ugo Ricci (forensic geneticist biologist at the Careggi Polyclinic in Florence) showed the presence of the same unknown saliva DNA profile, consisting of 10 alleles out of 22, on all three letters. This DNA, called ""Exhibit 80"", was compared with the DNA of the suspects, giving a negative result in any case. Recently, the documentary maker Paolo Cochi interviewed Dr. Marina Baldi, forensic geneticist, who stated that the profile obtained from the three letters, being made up of a sufficient number of alleles (10 total), is absolutely usable not only for comparisons with other profiles, but also for more detailed analyzes, such as for example the determination of phenotypic aspects of the author of the letters, such as the color of the eyes and hair.



- The Sardinian lead


 Stefano Mele was found guilty for the double murder in 1968. But then the shells found in the file of the murder were connected to the Monster. Mele was in prison in 1974, he couldnt be the Monster therefore the investigations were directed towards other people that he had accused in the past. This investigation, which developed during the 1980s, represented the main line of investigation in the Monster case until the acquittal of all suspects in 1989.
The investigators questioned Mele again, who accused Francesco Vinci again. But Vinci was in prison in August 1982 for mistreating his wife. While in prison, two months later, he was accused of being the Monster, but then a new murder took place in 1983, so he was therefore cleared of the charge; in 1993 he was found murdered in a pine forest near Chianni; he had been locked up in the trunk of a Volvo set on fire; a connection with the story of the Monster was hypothesized, a hypothesis however almost immediately discarded; more probably, also given the modalities of the crime, his murder was to be considered a revenge born in Sardinian criminal environments around which Vinci gravitated. The case remained essentially unsolved. The mystery of the shells found by pure chance in the file continued to create controversies. The journalist Mario Spezi discovered that there was no trace of the anonymous tip that, in the summer of 1982, had suggested to the investigators the connection between the crimes of the Monster and that of 1968. Without any developments the investigation ended in 1989.


- Suspect: Pietro Pacciani


Pietro Pacciani in 1984: https://images.app.goo.gl/vFmNDTUyFD4gBFy46


After the last murders in 1985 the investigations continued but, until 1991, there were no significant developments. The SAM (Anti-Monster Squad: the group of law enforcement agencies that had been investigating exclusively the murders of the Monster since 1984) was headed by Ruggero Perugini. Pietro Pacciani became the prime suspect in 1991, while he was in prison for the rape of his two daughters; an anonymous letter dating back to 1985 invited investigators to investigate him. Born in Ampinana in 1925, he was a former partisan nicknamed ""the Vampa"" because of his short temper and his past as a fire eater for village fairs. Pacciani was described as a choleric, depraved and brutal man, regardless of the accusations concerning the crimes of the Monster of Florence. In 1951, at the age of 26, Pacciani surprised his then girlfriend (just fifteen), in intimate attitudes with another man; taken by jealousy he stabbed his rival to death, then forced the girl to have sexual intercourse next to the corpse. He was arrested and trialed: he declared that he had been blinded by fury, having seen his fiancée exposing her left breast (the same one that in the last two crimes was removed from the female victims). For this murder Pacciani was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which he served entirely. The story was infamous in Tuscany, so much so that it was told by storytellers. The analogy of this crime with those of the Monster were the intuition and the main clue that lead the investigators to seriously investigate Pacciani. The hypotesys was that he killed couples to relive, as a ""winner"", the crime in 1951, particularly raging on the woman who symbolized the ex-girlfriend who had betrayed him. The clues were various: Pacciani wrote the word Republic with a single B, he owned newspapers and magazines that spoke of the crimes of the Monster, photos with pubis marked in pencil and had written on a sheet of paper a license plate number of a car belonging to a couple who was staying in the Scopeti area, the scene of the crime in 1985. Furthermore, Pacciani had links (some explicit, others more forced) with all the places where the eight double murders took place. However, what could theoretically have evidential value were only three objects held by Pacciani: a cartridge found in his garden [more about this later], a drawing pad and a soap dish (both thought to belong to the victims of the murders in 1983) He was a sexually perverse and violent person, even after the murder in 1951, not only towards his family. One time he kicked and shoveled a man who ended up hospitalized for 26 days. Pacciani, in addition to denying his guilt, wanted to be seen as an ""innocent lamb"", a poor farmer (as he liked to define himself), that is, the image of a good and simple person, despite the testimony of people who knew him as a very violent, arrogant and quarrelsome man. Many of his fellow villagers were very afraid of him and were careful not to frequent him.
Public opinion was essentially split in two over his guilt. What is certain is that Pacciani was a rather particular character: a chronic liar, poet and self-taught painter as a hobby, experimented with a thousand professions. Over the years, his violent disposition were directed at his wife, a semi-mentally ill woman (beaten and forced into sexual relations), and their two daughters, kept segregated at home, fed with dog food, beaten, raped; the two daughters left home as soon as they came of age, definitively breaking off with their father, and shortly after leaving the house they reported him for rape (accusation for which Pacciani was convicted, remaining in prison from 1987 to 1991). 


[To have a better understanding of the trial I will explain briefly how the justice system works in Italy. There are three degrees of judgement: the first trial, the appeal and the appeal to the supreme court (Cassazione). So you have ""three chances"" to disprove your guilt.]


Pacciani was arrested on charges of being the Monster on January 17, 1993. On April 19, 1994, the trial of first degree began, with the prosecution represented by the deputy prosecutor Paolo Canessa and which ended on November 1, 1994 with the sentence of to life imprisonment for being responsible for fourteen of the sixteen murders he was charged for (he was found not guilty of the first double murder in 1968). However, he was then acquitted fifteen months later, in the appeal trial. In fact, on February 13, 1996, Pacciani was acquitted by the Court of Appeal of Florence for not having committed the crime and was therefore released from prison. The magistrate, president of the court of appeal, harshly criticized the accusatory system against Pacciani (later putting, in black and white, all the criticisms of the investigation in a book). However, on December 12, 1996, the Supreme Court annulled the acquittal and ordered a new appeal process, which would never be held due to Pacciani's death on February 22, 1998. The previous appeal process against Pacciani was judged compromised by a technical error, which prevented the hearing and verbalization of the testimonies of four people (nicknamed Alfa, Beta, Gamma and Delta), among whom there where the ""snack companions"".
Various elements were evaluated for the conviction of Pacciani in the first trial, mostly of circumstantial value, like interceptions of violent reproaches to his wife Angiolina (which in themselves proved nothing, but which weakened the image of a meek and harmless man that Pacciani wanted to give of himself), a pistol cartridge (on appeal later judged as ""worthless"" in a ""polluted investigation"") compatible with the shells found in the murder sites and found in Pacciani's garden, some objects that the prosecution believed belonged to some of the victims, in addition to the testimonies of some people who recognized him in the places of the murders as a voyeur. In 2019, a new survey was carried out on the bullet found in Pacciani's garden in 1992. The new report revealed that the marks on that bullet had been artifacts, thus suggesting that the bullet had been tampered with on purpose, as claimed by Pacciani himself during the trial. The other two objects (the drawing pad and soap dish) were also not connected to the victims in any meaninful way. An element initially overlooked in the trial was the large movements of money in the farmer's bank account, figures perhaps too large at the time for a simple farmer like him. This money was considered as an indication of his involvement only in investigations following the convictions of the ""snack companions"", when it was hypothesized that Pacciani and his buddies had received money to carry out the killings on commission from never identified instigators. The thesis that Pacciani was a mercenary assassin on commission was incompatible with that of the trial in 1994, where Pacciani was accused of being a solitary serial killer. Only in the mid-nineties the investigations focused in more detail on some of Pacciani's friends involved in the affair: Mario Vanni, Giancarlo Lotti and Fernando Pucci.


Following the acquittal of Pacciani in the appeal process, his wife decided to leave their home and in July of the same year she started the procedures for the separation. In December 1996 Pacciani was indicted for kidnapping and mistreatment of his wife. Pacciani, after the acquittal, had returned to live alone in his cottage, where in the evening he used to barricade himself, bolting the door and all the shutters, as if he was afraid of something or someone (as confirmed from the testimonies of neighbors). In May 1996 Gessica Massaro, an aspiring pornstar from Taranto, claimed to have become Pacciani's lover and to have filmed their erotic exploits in a video. Pacciani denied it, but on September 16, 1998 the video - entitled Porn Motel - was officially presented by Massaro and made visible to subscribers of a site created ad hoc by the producers (for non-subscribers, the only visible scene showed the walk of the two in the garden of his house in Mercatale). The video is currently lost media.
On February 22, 1998, before the second appeal trial, Pacciani was found dead in his home with his pants down and his sweater pulled up to the neck. The clothes had significant fecal soiling. The autopsy showed that Pacciani had died of natural causes. In anatomopathological terms it was a condition of severe atheromatous coronary heart disease with postischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (outcome of multiple previous infarct events). At the level of the gastric cavity, the presence of Formoterol fumarate (an antiasthmatic drug better known under the name Eolus) was detected. The toxicological tests performed did not give a positive indication on the presence of the aforementioned drug in the blood stream, thus excluding a possible causal / concausal effect of death by the drug. It should be remembered that the drug in question was prescribed by Pacciani's general practitioner, on April 19, 1997. The prescription was made for probable bronchial problems. 


 In the investigations about the esoteric and the instigators lead it was hypothesized by the investigators that Pacciani was part of an esoteric-satanic sect and that he had been killed, through the anti-asthmatic drug, by the members of the aforementioned sect because he had betrayed them. This hypothesis, in addition to not having medical-legal evidence, is illogical as the drug was prescribed by Pacciani's general practitioner. 
The fact that Pacciani died of natural causes was also recently reiterated by the coroner Giovanni Marello (the one who performed the autopsy on Pacciani). In particular, prof. Marello underlined the fact that Pacciani was a severely cardiopathic elderly person and the anatomopathological findings highlighted in the autopsy are not compatible with poisoning. Pacciani's remains were exhumed in July 2013 to be destined for a mass grave. One of the main witnesses of the accusation against Pacciani was Giuseppe Bevilacqua (former director of the American cemetery in Florence) who said he saw the farmer in the area near the last crime attributed to the murderer, in 1985, a few hours after the murders [more about him later].


 - The ""snack companions"" (Mario Vanni, Giancarlo Lotti, Fernando Pucci)


-Mario Vanni


Mario Vanni, born in San Casciano in 1927, was a retired postman nicknamed ""Torsolo"" (an awkward and clumsy person). He became particularly infamous as the involuntary inventor of the term "" snacks companions''. While he was heard as a witness at the trial against Pacciani, Vanni was asked ""Mr. Vanni, what work do you do?""; he answered, starting his deposition in an unexpected and illogical way ""I have been eating snacks with Pacciani, no?"". Vanni was probably misled by the expression ""what work do you do?"", which in the Tuscan dialect is equivalent to ""but what have you done?"". Vanni was arrested concurrently with the acquittal of Pietro Pacciani, for complicity in double murder and vilification of a corpse, carried out together with Pacciani according to the prosecution. During the course of the trial Vanni demonstrated a hostile attitude towards the judges, mostly dictated by ignorance, alcohol abuse, fear and his advanced age, which perhaps did not allow him to clearly understand the course of the hearings . He was often removed from the courtroom, until he was expelled after having threatened Prosecutor Canessa with the expression ""then there will be the Lord who will punish Mr. Canessa with a hideous pain, he will have to suffer like a dog"", then he boasted his political faith for Mussolini and fascism, shouting «Long live the Duce, work and freedom! We will be back! Sooner or later! "". However, his defense attorney Nino Filastò later managed to get him readmitted to court. Vanni was sentenced to life in prison. The sentence, for only four of the eight double murders, was finalized in 2000 by the Supreme Court. In 2004 his sentence was suspended for health reasons, as he was suffering from senile dementia. Vanni spent his last five years in a retirement home for the non self-sufficient elderly in the province of Florence. He was admitted to the hospital in April 2009 and died the next day at the age of 81. 


-Giancarlo Lotti


Giancarlo Lotti, nicknamed ""Katanga"", was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the crimes of the Monster; like Mario Vanni he was also born in San Casciano, in 1940. He was orphaned of both parents at a young age and isolated from relatives, he was an unemployed person who previously had only small odd jobs. He was also an acoholic since adolescence and had intellectual problems. He lived with the help of the local charity and, unable to pay rent independently, he found accommodation in the rectory of a parish priest. Lotti confessed to the investigators, forced by the testimony of his friend Fernando Pucci, who indicated that he had seen the crimes in 1985 take placs and that he had been led there by Lotti himself. Pucci testified ""The visibility was not bad because the moon was growing [...] As he approached us we saw two people between the car I mentioned and the tent. One was shorter and stockier and the other was taller. The stocky one had a gun in his hand. The taller one was holding a kitchen knife. The stocky one saw us and immediately said to us: I'll kill you, I'll kill you, go away! We turned our backs and ran away. When we got back to the car I was quite frightened. One of the two seemed to be Vanni, indeed it was certainly Vanni. The stocky one with the gun, I recognized him as Pacciani"".
Lotti then admitted to having been present at the crime, accusing Pacciani and Vanni. Subsequently, he also accused himself of that crime, as of the two previous ones in 1982 and 1983. In particular, in the murder of the two German boys in 1983, he allegedly shot them, threatened by Pacciani himself. Lotti's testimonies were considered decisive in all stages of the trial, although the accused had maintained an ambiguous and reticent attitude.


The thesis according to which Lotti was a suggestible, mentally challenged, mythomaniac subject and that therefore his statements were unreliable was considered unfounded. The judge wrote in the appeal sentence: ""It is worth remembering immediately that the said individual (Lotti Giancarlo) was subjected to an appraisal by psychiatric consultants of the Public Prosecutor [...] he was declared a ""lucid, alert, conscious, perfectly oriented in time, space, towards his person and the situation in question"". Furthermore, the same judge reported, in relation to the feared possibility that Lotti could have accused himself in order to obtain benefits: ""I suspect that the thought of solving the problems of his life by serving 30 years of imprisonment but happy with this for the advantages that law reserves to collaborators of justice, well this thing appear to this judge to be meaningless because it is completely unproven first of all and then contrary to common sense ""
It must be said that the defense of Mario Vanni (Nino Filastò) highlighted some inconsistencies in the reconstruction of the crimes made by Lotti, which were not accepted by the judge. Lotti did not obtain, as requested by his lawyer, any benefit as a collaborator of justice. His sentence was 26 years in prison. He was released from prison on March 15, 2002 for serious health reasons and on March 30 he died at the age of 61 from a liver tumor, from which he had been afflicted for a long time, due to his alcoholism. 


-Fernando Pucci


Born in Montefiridolfi in 1932, he was a friend of the three ""snack companions"". He had a disability recognized in 1983 as oligophrenia and was a decisive witness in the sentences of his ""snack companions"". Regarding his condition, a new appraisal was drawn to ascertain whether Pucci really was suffering from some disability and the result was: ""The intellectual assets appeared poor but not exactly as deficient as shown by the commission for civil invalids back in 1983 ... vigilant attention and valid memory without hints of yielding or slowing down or numbness ... The thought is not very rich in content, rather monotonous and not very modulated. The logical connections are however preserved and the contents were always pertinent to the context in question"".
According to the assessments, collected by the judge, there was no reason why this subject was unable to give testimony. He deposed against Pacciani and Vanni as an eyewitness to the last two murders: ""To look at what had happened without being noticed we turned a bit between the branches, to get to the side of the car parked near the tent. Shortly after we saw this scene: one of the two, the taller one, Vanni, went behind the back of the tent and with that kitchen knife he had in his hand cut the fabric. I also remember the noise he made , of torn canvas. The gesture I saw seemed to me to be done from the bottom up. At this point the man came out of the tent, from the front, running away towards the wood, that is, on the opposite side of the road... having a gun, that is, Pacciani, shot him and followed him while he ran away, continuing to shoot "". Pucci's statements left some doubts, the witness at first appeared reticent. Furthermore, in the courtroom the defense tried to invalidate his statements. Fernando Pucci died in 2017, at the age of 84.

A coroner's court has heard that Ms Geertsema's partner, John Shepherd, is considered a ""person of interest"" in her disappearance, but no charges have been laid. 

Mr Shepherd, who now lives in Westbury, sat in the back of the courtroom alongside his wife of 30 years as the inquest began.

In her opening statement, counsel assisting the coroner Madeleine Wilson SC told the court that on the night Ms Geertsema disappeared, one of her daughters had reported there was a heated argument between Mr Shepherd and her mother.

That argument was then ""followed by hitting sounds, followed by silence,"" Ms Wilson said.

Ms Wilson put to the court that Ms Geertsema was planning a life without Mr Shepherd, without ""fear and violence"".

""She didn't choose to go; her life was ended for her,"" Ms Wilson said.

* The former partner of a Tasmanian woman who went missing more than 40 years ago is being considered a person of interest in her disappearance, a coroner's court has heard. Almost 43 years on, a coronial inquest will in December examine how she disappeared and consider whether ""she was murdered"".

""[There's] no evidence to find Ms Geertsema had left the state, had committed suicide or drowned in Devonport,"" counsel assisting the Coroner Madeleine Wilson SC told a case management conference in the coroner's court in Launceston on Thursday.

""Her body was never found."" 

Ms Wilson told the court that Ms Geertsema's former partner, John Shepherd, was considered a ""person of interest"" in her disappearance, but no charges had been laid.

Mr Shepherd, who now lives in Westbury and has been married for 30 years to another woman, sat at the back of the court with his wife during the hearing.

Ms Wilson said Ms Geertsema and Mr Shepherd met in 1971 and started dating.

""It was not an exclusive relationship,"" Ms Wilson told the court.

The court heard Ms Geertsema was also having a relationship with a man called Micky Rowe, who lived in Westbury, and whom she intended to marry.

""She was leaving John Shepherd and going to live with Micky Rowe,"" Ms Wilson told the court.

The court heard on the night she disappeared, Ms Geertsema told Mr Shepherd she was going to visit a friend in Parkham, in the state's north-west, but she never arrived.

Ms Wilson told the court it was Mr Shepherd who reported Ms Geertsema missing to police.

The court heard Mr Shepherd told police that Ms Geertsema was in ""a very distressed state"" before she went missing and that she'd told him that she was pregnant and had cancer.

However, Ms Wilson said the missing woman had visited a GP the morning of her disappearance, and that the doctor had reported she was ""in good spirits, was not pregnant and did not have cancer"".

Inquest to examine relationships

The inquest into Ms Geertsema's disappearance has been set for December 13, 14 and 15 and will be heard in Launceston.

643,I_try_2271,1639367343,"On August 1st, 1970, 15-year-old Helen Barker went missing in Australia.  

The official report says, she visited a friend’s house in Boulder. When she arrived her friend was not at home. At about 7 pm her friend’s mother gave her a lift back towards her home at Milton Street, Boulder, dropping her off about 50 meters away. Helen did not arrive home and was reported as a missing person. She has not been seen since. 

Then, in 1988, the partially decomposed remains of a white female were located in a rural area of Owen County, KY, laying in close proximity to a roadway.  Due to decomposition, they couldn't identify the victim. She has been estimated to be between the ages of 25-40.

Although it sounds far-fetched that a girl who went missing in Australia would end up in the USA, there are several ways in which this could have happened such as human trafficking or even a simple kidnapping. 

The resemblance between the two is uncannily similar. Observe the thin lips and the thin eyebrows. The Nasolabial folds are also similar and their eyes are downward sloping. According to her year of birth, in 1988, she would have been 33 which fits the age estimate.

646,Fit_Wrongdoer6810,1639331640,"  Twenty-seven-year-old Su Taraskiewicz was a Northwest Airlines ramp supervisor and only the second female ground service employee working for the airline. She was the first woman promoted to her supervisor position. On September 12, 1992, Su left work to go get food for her coworkers and vanished. On September 14, her body was found stuffed in her trunk, parked at a nearby auto body shop. She had been stabbed multiple times and beaten to death. At first, her family assumed that she was the victim of a random act of violence until in late 1993, her mother Marlene found her diary and was shocked at what was written in it. It told of sexual harassment, threatening graffiti in men's room and cargo holds, and other incidents that had occurred to her while working for Northwest Airlines. Marlene was certain that it had something to do with her murder.  
In one incident in April of 1989, a coworker named Bobby damaged her radio twice. Su asked her boyfriend to talk to Bobby about getting her a new radio. When she spoke to Bobby again, he threatened to kill her boyfriend. She filed several complaints to the airline and her union, but little was done about it. After she filed the reports, the harassment worsened; she received several anonymous phone calls, with the caller threatening to hurt her. Also, on several occasions, her and her boyfriend's cars were vandalized. Friends and co-workers who supported her also had their cars vandalized.  
Su's diary only covered the first eight months of her time at Northwest. However, several co-workers reported that the discrimination and harassment continued. In February of 1992, she was promoted to ramp supervisor. Originally, another co-worker had received the job. However, Su learned that he had illegally bid for the job. She filed a grievance and won; as a result, she received the position. Shortly after her promotion, Su found a graffiti drawing of a coffin with her name on it in her locker. Despite this, she continued to work harder.  
She and her co-worker, Deborah Mazeikus, were involved in a meeting with Northwest that did not go well. During the meeting, Su became upset and started to cry. Deborah was concerned about the emotional toll that the harassment was causing in Su's life. She told Deborah that she was scared, but did not elaborate on who she was scared of. Deborah believes that she was afraid for her life. The harassment continued, and then came September 12, when she mysteriously disappeared after leaving work to pick up food for her crew. Surprisingly, her co-workers did not report her missing for a day and a half.  
When she was later found dead, police suspected that her death may have been connected to a federal investigation of Northwest Airlines that took place in the summer preceding her murder. Some of the baggage handlers working with her were operating a stolen credit card ring. When shipments of new cards were transported by Northwest jets, they would steal them and use them or sell them. Ten of them were later arrested and convicted, some of which were named by her in her diary.  
Su's family later settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with Northwest Airlines. A $250,000 reward is being offered by her family for an arrest in the case, which remains open but unsolved.  
**Suspects:** Before Susan left work on the night she vanished, around 1AM she received a telephone call from an unidentified person who wanted to meet her. Marlene believes that the call was from someone Su trusted, who lured her to a meeting with her killer.  
Two prime suspects in the case are two of Su's coworkers: Joseph Nuzzo and Robert Brooks (also known as Bobby). Su had several problems with the two; Brooks had broken her radio for no apparent reason and later threatened her. Nuzzo also threatened her after she broke up a fight between him and another employee. As a result, he was suspended from work for six months. He blamed Su for this; during this time, he keyed her car, slashed her tires, staked out her house, made anonymous telephone calls, and told others that he would ""exact revenge"".  
Shortly after Nuzzo returned to work, he and several other baggage handlers began to steal credit cards from mail bags air-freighted by Northwest. Brooks was also involved in the scam, using the cards with Nuzzo. In August of 1992, several baggage handlers were subpoenaed by a grand jury. Nuzzo allegedly believed that Su had told the police about the scheme. Two days later, he was fired. A few weeks after his firing, Su was found dead.  
Nuzzo was later convicted on various charges related to the credit card scheme. Brooks moved out of the area prior to the murder; he cooperated with police and later pleaded guilty to theft and fraud charges. However, he was later charged with lying to a federal grand jury. He claimed that he was working in another state on the night of Su's murder and that he didn't talk to Nuzzo on the day of Su's murder. Both statements were proven false.  
Nuzzo and Brooks remain suspects, along with Su's other co-workers at Northwest.  
**Extra Notes:** This case first aired on the February 9, 1996 episode. A fictionalized version of the case was featured on the show ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"".  
**Results:** Unsolved. Staff at Northwest Airlines refused an interview on the show, leaving a lot of questions of what led directly to Su's death. The case is still open and being investigated by law enforcement. Nuzzo and Brooks, along with several of Su's other coworkers, remain prime suspects in her murder. Each year, Su's family and friends hold a memorial service on the anniversary of her death.  
Sadly, Su's father and brother have both since passed away.

651,imagrandma2,1639302758,"It’s an indication that progress is ramping up in the case of Ayla a decade after her disappearance, which is giving her mother, Trista Reynolds, renewed hope.

“I’m actually hoping that this is the year my Christmas wish will come true,” Reynolds said this week.

Ten years ago this month, the 20-month-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed Ayla was in the care of her father, Justin DiPietro, at his mother’s house on Violette Avenue in Waterville. He called police to report her missing on the morning of Dec. 17, 2011, launching the largest and costliest police investigation in Maine history.

Ayla has never been found and no one has been charged in the case. A judge in 2017 declared her dead, paving the way for Trista Reynolds to file a wrongful death lawsuit against DiPietro in December 2018 that contends he should be held accountable for Ayla’s death.

After delays in the case last year because of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues, Trista Reynolds’ lawyer, William H. Childs, this year received documents he was seeking from the state Attorney General’s Office, including evidence and documents from the Maine State Police investigation. https://www.centralmaine.com/2021/12/12/a-decade-in-the-case-of-missing-waterville-child-ayla-reynolds-ramps-up/

Background:
The biggest criminal investigation in state history began with a 911 call in which a father said his 20-month-old daughter was last seen about 10 hours before, gave a brief description of the green pajamas she was wearing and said “there’s no way” she could have crawled out of her crib.

In transcripts obtained Monday first by the Associated Press and then by the Morning Sentinel through the Freedom of Access Act, Justin DiPietro told the emergency dispatcher that he put his daughter Ayla Reynolds to bed at 8 p.m. Dec. 16, 2011, and that his sister checked on her two hours later, at about 10 p.m.

He dialed 911 the next day at 8:49 a.m. During the call, DiPietro is asked when he last saw Ayla.

“When I put her to bed last night. My sister checked on her. Um, woke up this morning, went to her room and she’s not there,” he says. At one point, the phone call ends and DiPietro calls back, explaining “my cellphone died.”
Asked by a dispatcher about the exact time someone last saw Ayla in her crib, DiPietro asks his sister, Elisha.

Um, Elisha, when was the last, when is last time you went in her room last night when you saw her?” DiPietro asks. She responds 10 p.m. and he repeats the time to the dispatcher.

The Associated Press and Morning Sentinel requested the material after the state Supreme Court ruled such transcripts should be made public unless law enforcement officials can show how releasing the documents would harm an investigation. The Portland Press Herald last year sought transcripts of 911 calls in connection with a fatal shooting in Biddeford, prompting the court’s ruling on such transcripts.

Ayla was reported missing from the Waterville home on Violette Avenue where DiPietro lived with his mother. The night she disappeared, his sister and girlfriend, Courtney Roberts, were at the house with their children. His nmother was not home that night.

The 911 call prompted a search by police that grew to include game wardens, FBI agents and other officers, who canvassed neighborhoods, lowered streams and sent divers into the nearby Kennebec River. Investigators found blood inside the home, and they have concluded that Ayla is no longer alive and was a victim of foul play.
Detectives also said DiPietro, Elisha DiPietro and Roberts know more than they’ve told investigators, but the case remains unsolved and no charges have been filed. https://www.centralmaine.com/2014/02/03/transcripts_detail_justin_dipietro_s_911_call_reporting_ayla_reynolds_missing_/?rel=related&amp;rel=related",UnresolvedMysteries,"Ten years to the day that Justin DiPietro reported his daughter, Ayla Bell Reynolds, missing from their Waterville home, he will be interviewed as part of a civil lawsuit seeking to hold him accountable for her death.",0
652,MistressGravity,1639301545,"Disclaimer: If you're easily distressed, please *do not* listen to the 911 call below. It's seriously heartbreaking and bone-chilling in equal measures.

**What happened that day?**

Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home.

Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. 

When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hands. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There’s a bomb, and my dad just blew up!” By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne’s life. He had died almost instantly.

-----

**Who was Wayne Greavette?**

42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette.

At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. 

-----

**The Evidence**

This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter.

**The Package**

The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled [Domaine D’or Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh), which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we'll get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local to the area.

Two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

In the CBC podcast *Someone Knows Something*, the postwoman’s mother (who, alongside her grandson, were riding along as the postwoman did her rounds) said that the package delivered to the Greavette mailbox that day had a very fancy ribbon on it and that it was not at all heavy, as her grandson was able to lift it.

**The Flashlight**

The flashlight used to house the bomb was a Duracell-brand Floating Lantern around 23 cm long and 15 cm tall, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/h7xo02h). According to Justin, the flashlight might have been glued shut, as he was unable to open the flashlight when trying to get it to work. 

A type of mining explosive emulsion called **Superfrac** was used in the bomb. According to investigator Paul Johnson, around 1-1.5 pounds (0,5-0,7 kg) of Superfrac was probably used. He also said that Superfrac could be easily bought from the manufacturer without a license, but it was also likely obtained through theft. The bomb was also packed with roofing nails to maximise its destructive effect and was powered by a single-cell AA battery. 

**The Letter and Typewriter**

The letter included in the package was a business proposal and was written by one “William J. French”. In the letter, the writer mentioned that he and his partner were planning to start a new business called “Acton Home Products” in the new year (1997) and that he would like a quote from Greavette on fixing some equipment. The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works. Their names had been redacted when the letter was first released to the public.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a [vertical slash](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code ([L7G 2N1](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

However, one thing was chillingly clear: the [postscript](https://imgur.com/a/kH9dxty) of the letter indicated that the writer knew exactly what was going to happen when Wayne switched on the flashlight:

* “Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.**”

-----

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a [sketch](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed himself in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

-----

**Conclusion and personal thoughts**

Today (Sunday, 12 December 2021), is exactly 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are so many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

653,Shwinty,1639294476,"I've lurked a bit here for a while, but I'm still a little iffy on posting about this. I apologize if it's pushing the rules too much or if I wrongly used the Update flair! 

I'm going to post the link to the video first, for those who're impatient and curious and uninterested in my wall of text. In the interest in not making it a bigger wall of text, I'll also be linking an article outlining the Kenny Veach disappearance in more detail.

**The tl;dr of it is this:** Kenny Veach, an avid hiker, vanished in 2014 after hiking into Area 51 to look for a mysterious M-shaped cave he claimed to have found on an earlier hike that filled him with dread. Frank is a youtuber who's been regularly uploading caving videos (more often abandoned mines) weekly for close to 15 years. I've watched this man's videos for years and think this kind of upload is unlike him. I trust his judgement when it comes to caves.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv4PsEfXL1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv4PsEfXL1E)

[https://nevadamagazine.com/issue/september-october-2019/11423/](https://nevadamagazine.com/issue/september-october-2019/11423/)

I understand that initial reactions might be that the uploader was after the attention a missing persons mystery would bring him, but I don't think that's the case. I've followed Frank's channel for years simply because I enjoy calm caving videos and listening to the facts he has about the abandoned mines he explores, he's extremely knowledgeable and he's been uploading very regularly for as long as I can remember. He does what he does because he loves what he does and he loves sharing it with others, he never talks about view counts or subscribers. He never pulls tacky stunts.

Seeing this there in his uploads when I popped in to check out what he'd been up to lately after taking a break shocked me *because* of how unlike Frank it is for him to claim anything about a real tragedy. He's uploaded videos where he's been a little spooked (but not overreacting over it) and joked about seeing ""ghosts,"" but outright talking about a story as big as Kenny Veach's and calling it a potential candidate for the M cave is... well, I've been a viewer of his long enough to take it at least mostly seriously. He doesn't play any of it up for shock value, he doesn't pander to the camera, he just goes into this cave and comments on what he's seeing as an expert as per his usual style. The music used is normal for his videos.

I've seen almost no real talk of this specific video on Reddit, I did search around and found a few threads that simply slapped the link down with zero explanation, but **I wanted to post as a regular and long time viewer of Frank's**. He **knows** what he's talking about when it comes to mines and caves, he understands how to spot walls that have been tampered with (as miners often blocked up useless or dangerous passages) and what is or isn't out of place in a cave system. If he says something looks suspicious, I believe him. If he sees scratches on a wall that have him second guessing on if they're natural, I believe him. He's never given me reason not to before and I'm shocked this didn't end up in some other ""spooky"" youtuber's content or, if it has, that I haven't heard anything of it until now.

But that's just my two cents, a point of view I hadn't seen shared about this that I felt was worth sharing for those as interested in mysteries as I am. I don't really have anywhere else to go with this, so I'll just leave it up to ya'll to discuss (or not).

Aside from the extensive damage to the vehicle, there was some red paint found on the car, but no red paint in the area. (I’ll attach a pic in the comments.) The car had 11 miles on it after the air bags had been deployed. According to the Buckeye PD, this is not strange and has been reported before in accidents. 

Although Daniel’s remains have not been found, other human remains have been found in the area. Two have been confirmed to be the remains of other people.

One more sketchy detail, the car was found by a local rancher on July 19th. All prior foot and aerial searches had missed this even though these areas had checked. The Buckeye PD says it could have been missed because it was in a ravine. This all may be understandable except the father said the rancher who found the car was walking through the same area two days prior and told him the vehicle was not there. Considering the aerial searches didn’t find it either, I’d say it’s entirely possibly the car was placed there at a later date.",UnresolvedMysteries,This case needs your help!

656,OverYonder951,1639272810,"Looking back at the original post about this case in this sub, their was quite a bit of suspicion. Many people were hesitant to take the word of a murder, especially with such little evidence available. However this story raises a few other points in relation to the media and true crime forums. 

- Can the Media and members of the true crime community get to swept up in a good story and immediately jump to conclusions ? 

- And do you feel pressure to immediately side with the victim ? Within this sub and other subs many of the people who called into question John Eisenman’s story were ridiculed and harassed. People were extremely abusive. Many people have a mentality that a “victim” must always be telling the truth. However that simply just isn’t the case. It is very important to respect a victims accusation, but there are two sides to every story. Thoughts ?

658,Mr_Write_NEO,1639259840,"Melanie Suzanne Cooley left Nederland High School, where she was a senior, on April 15, 1975. She was last seen hitchhiking in Nederland, wearing jeans, a denim jacket and tan-colored boots.   

A road maintenance worker found Melanie's body on May 2, 1975 in Coal Creek Canyon. She had been hit over the head repeatedly with a large rock, her face was badly beaten, and she’d been strangled. Her hands were tied in front with a yellow nylon cord -  apparently “many, many feet of it, wrapped around and around."" 

Melanie lived with her family in the foothills halfway between Nederland and Boulder, on Magnolia Road. She was reportedly a good student; classmates and teachers alike either loved her or had a tough time getting along with her, as Suzi would speak her mind and didn’t always follow the rules, which got her in trouble at times.  

Melanie took photographs for the high school yearbook, kept score for the basketball team, and worked at Eldora Ski Resort as a valet driver. She also did macrame, painted, made jewelry, wrote poetry, played guitar and sang. She embroidered a large eagle on the back of her denim jacket (the one she was wearing when last seen).  After school she often hitchhiked home with neighbors who lived along Magnolia Road, as she apparently didn’t like riding the bus. Friends saw Melanie with her thumb out near the school the day of her disappearance. 

She never made it home. 

While gas receipts place notorious serial killer Ted Bundy in nearby Golden, CO on the day Melanie disappeared, local authorities say that evidence is inconclusive and continue to treat her homicide as a cold case. 

Given her age, appearance, similarities between the circumstances of Melanie's disappearance and death and those of Bundy victims Debbie Kent (abducted outside her high school), Lynette Culver (ditto), and Melissa Smith (another small-town high school girl, of similar appearance, whose body was discarded in nearby desert), I'm inclined to think Bundy is responsible. The murder took place firmly within his ""Colorado period,"" and gas receipts allegedly put him less than an hour away on the day in question. Bundy lived in Salt Lake City, Utah at the time, so his presence in the area that day is significant. 

Melanie's mother reportedly doesn't think Bundy did it, but she also states that Bundy was ""confessing to anything and everything, with abandon"" in the days before his execution. For one, he never confessed to Melanie's murder, so it's questionable whether the crimes he DID confess to are even relevant; for two, to my knowledge Bundy only confessed to the murders of eight or nine women. Considering the number of crimes he's suspected of, I'd call the number he officially copped to pretty conservative. 

Sadly there's not much info about Melanie online, but here is [her page](https://apps.colorado.gov/apps/coldcase/casedetail.html?id=1337) on the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's website.

She is mentioned briefly in [this article](https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2019/02/11/top-5-takeaways-our-ted-bundy-ama-reddit/2842141002/) on Bundy's Southwest murder spree from the Coloradoan.

SPOKANE, Wash. – Spokane Police have found no evidence a murdered man traded a woman for sex, despite what the woman’s father’s claimed upon his arrest.

John Eisenman is charged with killing Andrew Sorensen in October of 2020. Charging documents say Eisenman told police it started when he rescued his daughter from Seattle, where he claimed Sorensen was trafficking her.

Then a week later he found out where Sorensen was going to be, the documents said. He told detectives he tied Sorensen up, punched him and threw a cinder bock at his head. He then told detectives he stabbed Sorensen several times and locked him in the trunk.

It wasn’t until a year after that Soresen’s body was found. It was discovered in October of this year when someone saw a suspicious car and found his body inside.

Spokane Police announced Eisenman’s arrest in a press release. In that release, police said, “In October 2020 Eisenman learned his juvenile daughter was allegedly sold to a sex trafficking organization in the Seattle area.”

That story made national headlines and people even set up online fundraising accounts to pay for Eisenman’s legal fees.

According to new court documents filed this week, though, investigators said there’s no evidence of sex trafficking. It also said Eisenman was told by his daughter that she was traded for drugs in Seattle.

In the affidavit of facts filed on November 29, investigators said Sorensen and Eisenman’s daughter traveled to Renton together in October 2020. The document said they smoked meth several times on the way over.

According to police, Sorensen dropped Eisenman’s daughter and two others off at a 7-11 and never returned. Investigators later determined his car was stolen.

Eisenman’s daughter eventually called Renton Police to say she was stranded. Renton Police said when they arrived, the woman was uncooperative and walked away.

“I can find no information that indicates that Sorensen and \[Eisenman’s daughter\] ever met up again,” wrote Spokane Police Office Randy Lesser.

Police found evidence the two interacted on Facebook two days later.

“When \[she\] sends Facebook messages to Sorensen… she never mentions anything about Sorensen allegedly sex trafficking her,” Lesser wrote.

The woman showed up at the emergency department of Sacred Heart on October 23, 2020. According to court documents, she told a mental health specialist that she met a guy in Seattle who gave her drugs and sex trafficked her; she never mentioned Sorensen. She later told someone else at the hospital that her boyfriend took her to Seattle and sold her for drugs. She also said she had been homeless for three weeks and had been passed around for sex.",UnresolvedMysteries,John Eisenman case update: the 'Hero Dad' who was praised all over the media (including on this sub) for killing his daughter's sex trafficker is no hero.,0

665,aeiourandom,1639195819,"On the night of 18th August, 1980, Thomas Cooper, an 18 year old apprentice plumber, and his 16-year-old girlfriend drove to the beachside carpark at Rickett’s Point in Beaumaris, Melbourne, located near the Beaumaris Yacht Club. The car park was a well-known spot for couples to go ""parking"", and Mr Cooper went there several times a week with his girlfriend. The seclusion of the area also provided the opportunity for someone to hide and stalk anyone who happened to visit the carpark that night.

The couple arrived at 7.15 pm, Tom parking his white Holden sedan and the couple remaining inside their car.  They had been there for just 5 minutes when, without warning, a man smashed the driver’s window with a rifle barrel.

As Mr Cooper attempted to drive away, with the gunman yelled “don’t!”

Mr Cooper frantically drove the car back to the main road to escape the gunman, but the gunman fired several shots with a .22 rifle and Mr Cooper was hit three times.

Between Mr Cooper and his girlfriend, they managed to steer the car out on to Beach Rd where it crashed into a fence. His girlfriend was able to immediately flag passers-by and raise the alarm but Mr Cooper had died.

Mr Cooper’s girlfriend told police she saw the murderer for a only few seconds in the darkness, but that he appeared to be alone. She described him as Caucasian, about 25 years old or younger, 182cm tall, of medium build with shoulder-length black hair.  He was unshaven and had a moustache, and wore a dark coloured cowboy hat and possibly a coat. His identikit image is quite distinctive, someone knew this man.

Mr Cooper’s girlfriend was not injured in the attack. Unfortunately she passed away in May 2020, without this case being resolved.

A $1 million reward is on offer to solve the case.

Senior Sgt Ron Iddles, a detective on the 2013 review of the case, stated in the media that police have identified a strong suspect. The suspect had been interviewed soon after the murders but had an alibi from a female friend. “Believing that the tyranny of time might have changed things, we revisited the female who provided him with his alibi,’’ Sen-Sgt Iddles said. “Unfortunately we discovered she is still friendly with the suspect, but we will keep pursuing him.’’

In 2017, 3AW, a local radio station did a segment on the murder and received two calls, one possibly linking the son of an underworld figure to the murder, the other claimed they may have also seen the alleged murder around the same time.

In 2020, Detective Inspector Dean Thomas, from Victoria Police's Homicide Squad, said the motivation for the murder remained unclear. ""There are a number of possibilities, including that the shooting was sexually motivated and the girl in the car may have been the target,"" Det. Insp. Thomas said. ""We know that many couples regularly went to this location so the offender may have been stalking the area in the lead up to the shooting.

""The one thing we do know is that someone out there will know who is responsible for shooting Thomas and we're hopeful that after four decades, this person is ready to come forward and assist us with bringing his family some justice,"" he said.

At the time of Mr Cooper's murder, police released a digital composite image of a man they wished to speak to in relation to the incident.  This image has been forensically updated and aged to show what this man might look like in 2020. See links.

""Thomas's family have had to go 40 years without the answer to who would want to kill their son and brother,"" Det. Insp. Thomas said. ""As we always say, a lot can change over the years and hopefully this reward and the passage of time will encourage someone to come forward and give his family some peace.""

I would really like to see this solved. Just an innocent young man out parking at a Melbourne beach with his girlfriend and a lover’s lane stalker comes up and shoots him. As mentioned, Police believe they know who did this but he is being provided with an alibi by a female friend. Hopefully loyalties change over time and rewards or conscience lead to a break in the case.

The Family murders are the name of the murders of five young men and teenagers who happened in Adelaide, South Australia between 1979 and 1983. There’s a conviction in the last murder in the series, but I will include it due to the similarity and due to the man convicted being suspected in the other murders as well. There’s quite a lot of characters in this story but I will mainly focus on the three main suspects. The crimes are believed to be committed by a loosely knit group consisting of 12-13 individuals. 

# The suspects 

I’ll start with the last murder. 

**Bevan von Einem** was convicted in 1984 of the 1983 murder of 15-year-old Richard Dallas Kelvin. Kelvin was the son of a popular local news presenter and had gone missing, not long from his home on June 5, 1983. His body was found in scrub in Kersbrook on July 24, 1983, but is believed to have died around July 10 or July 11. His cause of death was blood loss due to an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a large blunt object. He had been held captive and tortured for around 5 weeks, and there was evidence that his hair had been cut in captivity. Five drugs were found in his system, Mandrax, Noctec, Rohypnol, Valium, and Amatel. Both the cause of death and Mandrax and Noctec are a recurring theme in these crimes. 

Bevan von Einem, also known as BVE, was born on May 29, 1946. He would drive around and pick up hitchhikers, offer them a spiked drink before raping them. Often he would undo his car exhaust or pull his choke out, before asking young men to help him. He would build relationships with drug addicts and give them drugs in exchange for helping him lure young men into his care. He would also use transgender women or crossdressers to lure young men under the pretense of going to a party. I only mention that they are transgenders due to it being a trait of his. He would also use his female friends as lures. 

**Mr R**, also known as “The Businessman”, was born in 1946, and was 33-years-old in 1979. He has lived with his partner known only as MGL in one of Adelaide’s “money suburbs” since the late 1970’s and is still living at the same house. 

**Mr B**, also known as “The Doctor”, was named as one of the main suspects by South Australian police in 2008. It’s known he was born in the UK in May 1956 and moved to Australia in 1966. He grew up with his six siblings on the outskirts of Adelaide. It’s mentioned that he was a former “child prostitute” but this isn’t elaborated on. He met BVE in 1979 when Mr B was 23, but could possibly have met him before. He’s currently living where he grew up and is working in the hospitality industry. Mr B made contact with the police two days after the first victim was found in 1979. Mr B was the star witness in BVE’s committal hearing. In BVE’s trial he stated:

* That he was present when BVE had picked up young men hitchhiking and drugged them. 
* That he had witnessed BVE with a naked youth who had a torch and an instrument similar to a large stainless steel crochet hook in his anus. 
* Mr B had been in the car when BVE picked up the first victim, and BVE had then called Mr R at a cafe. Mr B stated he left after they had met up with Mr R, but not before BVE invited him to “do some surgery on this guy”, leaving the unconscious first victim in the back of the car. Mr B’s sister testified that he had admitted that he was present when the first victim was killed. 

# The murders 

16-year-old **Alan Arthur Barnes** was reported missing on June 18, 1979, after failing to return from visiting a friend. He was last seen while hitchhiking being picked up by a white HQ Holden sedan carrying three or four people. There were several unconfirmed sightings, but one deemed credible was a sighting of Barnes in the company of two males the night before his body was located. His body was found in the South Para Reservoir on June 24, 1979. 

It was determined he had been held captive for 5 days, tortured and beaten, and his body had been washed and re-dressed. Toxicology showed he had alcohol and the drug Noctec in his blood. His cause of death was blood loss from an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a large blunt object. 

**Neil Frederick Muir** was 25 years old in 1979. He was suspected to be a prostitute, at the very least having sex with a doctor named Peter Millhouse in return for drugs. He frequented gay haunts but was not thought to be gay. Muir had known BVE since he was 18 years old. It’s stated in one source that he was involved in procuring boys for BVE. 

Muir was last seen on August 27, 1979, and his body was found the next day. His body had been cut into 4 sections and his organs had been removed and have never been found. His scrotum was cut open, the testicles off and the penis shaft neatly cut down the midline. I saw someone somewhere mention that this mutilation to his penis resembled genital reassignment surgery. Tattoos had been removed and his remains had been tightly wrapped in garbage bags, and placed inside his abdominal cavity. His head was tied to the torso with a rope going through the mouth and out through the neck. His cause of death was massive blood loss from an anal injury, likely caused by the insertion of a large blunt object. According to one source, a toxicology couldn’t be performed due to his organs missing, but another said the drug Noctec was found in his blood. 

14-year-old Peter Stogneff’s skull was found in Two Wells, on June 22, 1982, after a farmer had burned scrub off his property. The farmer returned home and called the police the next day, and the rest of the remains were discovered. Stogneff had been reported missing on August 27, 1981, after he failed to return home after having left. He had been supposed to meet his similarly aged uncle at Rundle Mall, but it was canceled the night before. It’s unclear if Stogneff went into the city anyway. There are reports of him having been seen with an adult male at Tea Tree Plaza the day he went missing, but this man has never been identified, though he is reported to have resembled one of BVE’s friends Noel Brook. Due to his remains having been burned, a cause of death couldn’t be determined, but his remains had been cut into three pieces. 

18-year-old Mark Andrew Langley went missing in the early morning hours of February 28, 1982, after leaving a party with two of his friends. A minor argument ensued which resulted in Langley getting out of the car and walking away. The friends drove off but returned shortly after to collect him, but he was nowhere to be seen. His body was found in scrub in Piccadilly, on March 8, 1982, but it was determined he likely died within 24 to 48 hours of his abduction. He died of blood loss due to anal injuries like the other victims. His body had been cut with a surgical instrument from his navel to his pubic region, which had been shaved. A part of his small bowel had been removed, and it’s believed evidence of the object that had been inserted into his anus had been left behind, and the perpetrator(s) had retrieved it. His body had been washed and re-dressed, and a sedative-hypnotic drug called Mandrax which was popular in the 1970’s disco scene, was found in his blood.

On April 10, 1815, [Mount Tambora in Indonesia exploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora), the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history with somewhere around 4 to 10 times the energy of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. It could be heard more than 1200 miles away, obliterated a bronze age culture living on the island, and lead to the deaths of 71,000-117,000 people. On the [Volcanic Explosive Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index), Tambora was classified VEI-7, super-colossal (the Yellowstone supervolcano is expected to be VEI-8, mega-colossal), and somewhere on the order of 100 cubic kilometers of material was ejected into the atmosphere, where it would hang for months, causing anomalies in the global climate leading to the year 1816 being called ""[the Year Without a Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer)"" in Europe, all the way on the opposite side of the planet.

Climate scientists researching the impact of volcanic eruptions on climate have found a clear record of the Tambora eruption in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, including a large spike in the concentration of atmospheric sulfates, as can be expected from the amount of sulfur that was output by the volcano. However, they also found another spike in sulfate concentration that would correspond to another slightly smaller VEI-6 volcanic eruption a few years prior to Tambora, sometime around 1809. This was further refined by tree ring data to late 1808 specifically.

It was the smoking gun evidence that there had been an eruption almost as large as Tambora just 7 years earlier... the only problem was, there was no smoking volcano to go with it. A VEI-6 volcanic eruption is not small. Krakatoa in 1883 and Pinatubo in 1991 were both VEI-6, and Mt. St. Helens in 1980 and Vesuvius that buried Pompeii in 79ce were both VEI-5. If Tambora could be heard up to 1200 miles away, surely *someone* would have noticed this mystery eruption. And if Tambora created a caldera 6-7 kilometers in diameter, surely there should be something similar left behind wherever the mystery eruption took place.

In addition to ice cores and tree ring data, we do have some slightly more direct records to corroborate an eruption. Colombian scientist Francisco José de Caldas was Director of the Astronomical Observatory of Bogotá, and in 1809 he recorded unusually cold weather and a ""transparent cloud that obstructs the sun's brilliance"". This transparent cloud was likely a ""dry fog"" similar one observed in 1816 in relation to the Tambora eruption, possibly comprised of aerosolized sulfuric acid. And in Peru, physician Hipólito Unanue made similar meteorological observations.

Thanks to these observations, the window for the eruption has been narrowed to within 7 days of December 4, 1808. We also know that the source was almost definitely a tropical volcano in the southern hemisphere, but no further south than 20 degrees south latitude. This leaves a swath of the southwestern Pacific ocean from roughly Indonesia to Tonga, an area where European sailors had visited but not yet colonized. There are indigenous accounts of eruptions, one or more of which could possibly our mystery eruption, but none of them are datable with any certainty. There are two confirmed eruptions in 1808, in the Azores and in the Philippines, but both occurred to early in the year to be the culprit.

671,Susan-B-Cat-Anthony,1639164449,"[Stacy Pennant](https://charleyproject.org/case/stacy-a-pennant) was a [21-year old Jamaican immigrant living in Laurelton, Queens, NYC](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1329dfny.html). She worked the graveyard shift at JFK airport as a cargo handler and attended classes at Queensboro College during the day. She kept a regular schedule, lived with her family, and had no reason to disappear. On the night of February 9, 1995 she drove with a friend to see the movie ""Higher Learning"" at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream. After the movie, she drove the friend home to Canarsie, Brooklyn, and dropped them off on E. 85th Street between Ave. M and Ave. N at 11:30pm. She was given directions back to the Belt Parkway, a highway which should have taken her home to Laurelton in about 30-40 minutes without any traffic. That was the last time anyone saw Stacy or her 1990 Honda Civic Del Sol. 


We've all seen in the news recent stories of long-missing people and their cars being found submerged in bodies of water. I propose that the reason why Stacy and her car have not been found in 26 years is because her vehicle entered the water that night and has been not easily accessible or visible.


[This is the route Stacy should have taken to get home that night using the Belt Parkway. It is basically a straight line eastward back home to Queens](https://imgur.com/vxKkKPg)


[The Belt Parkway has overpasses spanning 3 creeks which empty out into Jamaica Bay, but there are high barriers along the highway.

[The section in red is where the Belt Parkway meets the Van Wyck Expressway. There is often horrible traffic here from airport departures and arrivals. One way to detour around the traffic is to take the JFK Expressway, a highway that circles the airport. Stacy worked at JFK Airport as a cargo handler. I think because of her job, she likely knew about shortcuts to drive into and around the airport, especially the area around the employee parking lot.](https://imgur.com/xxixO4l)


[The JFK employee parking lot is located just off Lefferts Blvd. If there is bad traffic on the eastbound Belt Parkway, and you work at the airport like Stacy did, you might know to exit the highway at Lefferts Blvd, and turn onto Pan Am Road to get you around to the other side of the airport. Pan Am Road is where the employee parking lot is located and it runs very close to an inlet called Bergen Basin. This restricted waterway curves around the area where the airport fuel tanks are located. Signs warn no boating or swimming allowed. The tracks just north of Pan Am Road were renovated in 1998 when the Air Train was built, but I don't know whether Bergen Basin was affected by that.](https://imgur.com/w8lQEDQ)


[As of November 2021, there is a surprisingly low guardrail between Pan Am Road and the marshland surrounding Bergen Basin. There is landscaping between the water and the pavement, but you are only a few feet from the water's edge for most of the course of Pan Am Road.](https://imgur.com/DHfgtXs)



[The weather at JFK on the night of February 9, 1995 was in the 20s and windy.](https://imgur.com/aLF6Ivy)


I think it is possible that Stacy was tired from school and work, it was dark, cold, and windy, with perhaps ice on the pavement. If you are from NYC, you know there is always awful traffic on the Belt going by JFK. If you work at JFK, you might know how to avoid that traffic, especially by detouring down a roadway leading from the employee parking lot. I propose Stacy took a shortcut down Pan Am Road to avoid that section of the eastbound Belt Parkway on her way home to Laurelton. I think it's possible Stacy's vehicle entered the water of Bergen Basin, and because it's a restricted area no one has yet found the car in 26 years. 


I know there have been many theories over the years about what happened to Stacy: [from possible connections to another woman found murdered from the same area](https://medium.com/they-matter/cold-case-stacy-a-pennant-49e65bbad2b0), to a [very tenuous connection to an AC4 victim](https://murderincorp.wordpress.com/2020/05/21/stacey-pennant/). But I always come back to the fact that her car has never been found after all these years. Unlike Stacy, Kimberly Antonakos' car was found soon after her disappearance. Time and again when I hear about a person missing with their vehicle, they often end up being discovered under water. That's why I think it's possible.

672,Environmental_War_62,1639162135,"Hello, this is another ecuadorean case that I would like to share. It also takes place in Quito, the country's capital. This unidentified body is tied to the case of a girl name Juliana Campoverde so I'll give you a summary of that case:

**Juliana Campoverde** 

Juliana was a eighteen year old girl who went missing on July 7, 2012. On that day she and her mother were walking together and came across Jonathan Carrillo, the pastor of an evangelist church they had attended until a month ago. Juliana was supposed to go to work and then hang out with her boyfriend, but she never met him like she had planned to. On the following weeks, there was this strange pattern where a member of Jonathan's family would contact Juliana's mother Elizabeth and tell her God had send them visions and that she would soon hear from her daughter, shortly after Elizabeth would get a message from Juliana's number. In 2018 Jonathan Carrillo was arrested in connection to the disappearance, it was discovered he had created a secret Facebook account to stalk Juliana and all the text messages the family received after July 7 were sent from his phone. Jonathan eventually confessed to have killed Juliana and said he had thrown her body in the Bellavista ravine, located in northern Quito.  

**The bones found** 

The same year a search was carried out on that ravine and, as you can guess from the title, human remains were indeed found. Sadly they weren't much, a news article says the search team was only able to find a human jaw and some ribs but nothing more. Four DNA tests were made with Juliana's parents samples, two came back unconclusive and the other two were negative, which begs the question: if that is not Juliana, then who is it? There is very little information about this set of remains unfortunately, just that they are very few and not Juliana's and that's it. It is not even clear if it is a Jane Doe or a John Doe or how did those bones end up there. I couldn't find out if Jonathan was questioned further about the remains, apparently he chose to remain silent after confessing but was convicted of kidnapping which resulted in death and got 25 years. In April of this year more searches were carried out in the ravine but came up empty, no more bones were found and to this day police hasn't been able to locate Juliana's body or identify the skeletal remains found in the initial search. 

Thanks for reading.

Summers mom reports she was outside helping her Grandmother with the garden on June 25th, then at some point around 6.30pm, Summer did decide ventured back inside the home on her own because she ""wanted to go downstairs and play with her toys"". 
The day after she went missing, there was an Amber Alert issued that sadly did not bring any leads. The police also searched the area, but that sadly did not bring any leads either. 
Summers parents both believe that she was abducted from the home. Despite officials saying there is no evidence to support his claims. Summers three brothers have since been removed from the home and placed in the custody of Tennessee CPS. Recently Summers father made a statement after The Church Hill Rescue Squad set out a reward for any information leading up to finding Summer. He stated he did not believe it was right,because the Church Hill Rescue Squad reward is only up for six months, expiring in December. He stated it feels like they are giving up on his daughter in just a few months. Her parents also were interviewed speaking about their daughter in which they seemed to have forgotten the daughters birthdate and other information regarding their daughter. 
In Early September, Police were on the lookout for a maroon Toyota Tacoma between the years 1998-2000, that may have been seen around the area Summer went missing from but there have been no updates on that since then except that Summers teacher did purchase a similar red / maroon truck weeks prior after her father passed away.
Summers mother had a sister who also went missing in 2009, she was reported to be six at the time. This is not believed to be connected at this time, however there is speculation surrounding it. 

Facts to keep in mind when researching this case 
1. Shortly before Summer's disappearance, her previously chin-length blonde hair was buzzed down to a close crop.
2. Summer's three young brothers were removed from the Wells family home six weeks after her disappearance.
It came after Donald claimed that his house was a ""dangerous"" place to be amid a slew of threats being made against him and Candus, which turned reportedly drove him to start drinking heavily.
3. Donald Wells and Candus Bly both previously claimed to have taken and passed a lie detector test in relation to Summer's disappearance.
4. Around three weeks later after the disappearance, in July, Donald offered the grim prediction that Summer is probably no longer alive.
""Statistically speaking, there's a good chance she's already dead,"" Donald told the Kingsport Times-News. ""I hate to think that. I love her with all my heart.""

State investigators have received over a thousand tips in connection with Summer's vanishing but the Hawkins County Sheriff's Office said they have so far yielded no concrete leads.

The TBI is asking anyone with information about Wells’ whereabouts to call 1-800-TBI-FIND or contact the Hawkins County Sheriff’s Office at 423-272-7121.

The family is also asking for direct tips via their website findsummerwells.com.

**Who was Tracey Mertens?**

[Tracey Ann Mertens](https://imgur.com/a/wbvmzpV) met her future partner Joey Kavanagh when she was 16. At first, it seemed like everything was all right. She fell in love with him, and they had two children, daughter Kelly and son Daniel. By all accounts, Tracey was a good mother who doted on her children.

However, cracks started appearing in their relationship, and the couple often fought with each other. Moreover, Joey also had a heroin addiction at the time, and it was thought that he had owed a lot of people a lot of money.

In mid-December 1994, Tracey, Joey, and the children had moved to a new house in [Rochdale](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rochdale,+UK/@52.8350908,-2.6674954,9z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x487bb88ceb3db3ab:0x9a885edb20da6527!8m2!3d53.6097136!4d-2.1561), a town just outside of Manchester, around 160 km (100 miles) north of their old house in Birmingham. The reason behind this move is not clear.

-----

**22-23 December 1994**

Thursday, 22 December 1994, was a cold day in Rochdale. Tracey was heading south, back to her old house at [Cattells Grove](https://www.google.com/maps/place/10+Cattells+Grove,+Nechells,+Birmingham+B7+5RA,+UK/@52.4974734,-1.8701899,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4870bb42c6a63329:0xa8d61feac7bdc969!8m2!3d52.4974702!4d-1.8680012) in the Nechelles neighbourhood of Birmingham, to pick up a benefits book. She planned to make the trip as short as possible and to return that night but ended up staying the night at the nearby home of her sister-in-law. The next day, Friday, 23 December, she returned to the [Cattells Grove](https://imgur.com/a/XMKO4UX) house at around 11:50 am.

She’d been in the house for no more than 10 minutes when there was a knock at the front door. When Tracey answered the door, she was confronted by two men who grabbed, blindfolded and forced her into the back seat of a yellow Ford Escort Mk2, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/m3h4VHk). She was driven for about an hour to the [Christ Church](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Christ+Church,+Eaton/@53.1855022,-2.1987168,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487a4570c1c2bf79:0xbd34fb4b6de69c05!8m2!3d53.1855134!4d-2.1965275) in Eaton, Cheshire, around 100 km (60 miles) from Birmingham. When they arrived there, she was brought to the [churchyard](https://imgur.com/a/nbl4DIN), doused with petrol, and set on fire. The two men then left her to die. However, she managed to crawl around 30 metres (100 ft) towards the church gate and the main road, where she was found by a passerby who called 999.

Tracey’s wounds were horrific. She had suffered third-degree burns in more than 95% of her body. She was so severely burned that doctors had difficulty finding a blood vessel to start a drip. Her shoes, which was found near her, had been so thoroughly burned, attending officers thought they were pieces of coal. Despite being critically injured, Tracey was still alive, and over the next 12 hours, she fought with all the might she had to tell detectives everything she knew about what had happened.

Sadly, Tracey succumbed to her injuries and died in the early hours of Christmas Eve 1994. She was just 31 years old.

-----

**The investigation and the suspects**

Tracy described the two men who had abducted her as black (possibly Caribbean) men around 20-30 years old, tall and overweight, and spoke in a Brummie (Birmingham) accent. They were wearing brown leather caps and thigh-length leather coats. She said that as they barged into the house, they were asking her where Joey was and that her abductors had argued at some point in a foreign language, which detectives thought could be Patois, a Jamaican dialect. The yellow Ford Escort that she was taken in had a stuffed animal attached to the rear-right window.

When detectives searched the Cattells Grove address after Tracey’s death, they found the word “death” daubed on one of the windows in paint. They also received a tip from a couple with drug debt who were told that if they didn’t pay up, they’d “get what Tracey Mertens got”.

Detectives spoke to more than 2,000 people in the wake of Tracey’s murder but did not come across any information about the possible identities of the two men. When interviewed by police, Joey claimed that he did not know why Tracey was killed but said that it had nothing to do with his drug addiction. The police also have a DNA profile that could eliminate suspects. 

In November 1997, a coroner inquest into Tracey’s death returned an *open verdict*, meaning that there was insufficient evidence to make a definitive ruling on her cause of death. Her family was deeply unhappy about this verdict, wanting her death to be ruled an *unlawful killing*. However, according to coroner John Hibbert, an unlawful killing verdict requires evidence that satisfies the standard of proof, and although he believed Tracey’s version of events, it had to be corroborated by other evidence.

The case is still open and the Cheshire police are offering a £30,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Tracey’s killers.

-----

**Conclusion**

It’s been nearly 27 years since Tracey Mertens was violently killed in that Eaton churchyard. Amongst the many unanswered questions of this case, one thing is crystal clear: she was a courageous woman who did not deserve to die in such a dreadful manner. I sincerely hope her surviving relatives and her children can find some peace.

**Background**

Charlie Lawson was born on May 10th, 1886, to parents Augustus and Nancy, in the unincorporated community of Lawsonville, North Carolina.

Fannie Manring was born on October 13th, 1892, in Stokes County, North Carolina. Her parents were John Washington Manring and Ona Lee Manring.

Charlie and Fannie were married in 1911 and went on to have eight children together, one of whom (William), died in 1920 of an undisclosed illness. Their other seven children were Marie, Arthur, Carrie, Maybell, James, Raymond, and Mary Lou. Charlie was a tobacco farmer and eventually saved up enough money to purchase a derelict farmhouse in Germantown (North Carolina), near his brothers' farms, in 1927. The Lawson family was well-liked and respected in the community. 

A few months before the murders, Charlie sustained a head injury while digging a ditch. Shortly afterwards he saw a doctor named C. J. Helsabeck, who assured him that the injury was mild and nothing to be concerned about. However, Charlie often complained of severe headaches and insomnia following his accident. The people around him also noticed a marked difference in his personality. The previously kind and easygoing Charlie was now said to exhibit rude and impatient behavior on a regular basis. 

Two weeks before Christmas in 1929, Charlie took Fannie and their kids shopping in Winston-Salem. He allowed them to pick out whatever clothes, jewelry, shoes, etc. that they wanted. Afterwards, he took them to have a professional family portrait taken, which was costly then. All of this is very odd, because 1. Charlie had never taken the whole family shopping before and 2. He was spending a lot money, despite the fact that they were low income tobacco farmers struggling to make ends meet. I think that his uncharacteristic lavish spending indicates that he was probably already planning to kill them at this point and that he wanted to leave something of them (the picture) that was nice behind for posterity. 

**The murders**

The day of December 25, 1929, started off normally enough for the Lawson family. The oldest daughter, Marie, woke up early that morning to make a two layer Christmas cake as a surprise for her family. Arthur (16) went out rabbit hunting, which was a typical Christmas activity at this time. He ended up running out of ammo though and Charlie sent him into town to buy more. 

While Arthur was in town buying bullets, his father had taken a 12-gauge shotgun and shot and/or bludgeoned Fannie and six of their children (ranging in age from 4 months to 17 years old). He then went out to the woods. Relatives came to the house shortly after the murders, wanting to wish the Lawsons a Merry Christmas, but instead came upon a grisly scene of seven dead bodies. A couple hours later, a gunshot was heard out in the woods, which led to the discovery of Charlie Lawson's body. He had committed suicide. Footprints all around the area in which his body lay and which formed a circle, suggested that he had been pacing, perhaps for hours, after the murders. Was he trying to process what he had just done? Or maybe he was just working up the nerve to end his life? Or perhaps both.

They found two cryptic notes in his pocket, one of which read ""Trouble can cause"" and the other which said ""No one to blame but"".

**The aftermath**

Charlie's brother, Marion, opened up the home as a tourist attraction and it would remain open as such for five years, attracting thousands of visitors, including the mobster John Dillinger. The crime scene was left bloodstained and Marie's uneaten Christmas cake was kept on display as well. They ended up having to protect the cake with a glass cover though, as visitors kept taking raisins off of it as souvenirs. 

The crime shocked everyone and thousands attended the funeral. The bodies were buried in a mass grave, with baby Mary Lou nestled in her mother's arms. 

**Theories**

* 1. Charlie was mentally disturbed and was driven to commit such a horrific act as a result of the head injury that he had sustained months earlier. An autopsy was performed on his brain, but it was determined that his brain had no notable abnormalities. However, autopsies were not as thorough then and medical knowledge was not as advanced, so it's entirely possible that something important was missed in the examination.

* 2. He raped his daughter Marie and had gotten her pregnant. According to Marie's best friend, Ella May Johnson, Marie had confessed to her during a sleepover that she was pregnant with her father's child. Also, Charlie's niece Stella later came forward and claimed to have overheard a conversation once between Fannie and several other women in the family, including Stella's mother Jettie, in which Fannie expressed concern over the incestuous relationship between Charlie and Marie. There was no autopsy done on Marie and as far as I can tell, there was no official record confirming her pregnancy.

* 3. It was a combination of the first two theories.

* 4. The stock market crash of 1929 had occurred two months earlier. Maybe he gave up, decided to blow what little cash they had and then carried out the murder/suicide plan.

**The soul survivor**

Why did Charlie choose to spare his oldest son Arthur's life? Some have speculated that he did so because he believed that Arthur would have stopped him from carrying out his plan. Although presumably he could have circumvented this issue by killing Arthur first. In my opinion, he chose to spare Arthur because he wanted one of his sons to live to carry on his name. This was a still big deal to men during this era. Sadly, Arthur did not live a long life anyway. He died in a car accident in 1945, at the age of 32, leaving behind a wife and 4 children.

Joshua's dad, Brian, sued Minnesota's Stearns County Sheriff's Office for the release of the investigative file pertaining to his son's 19-year disappearance. In January, that case will get a scheduling conference, which will set the date of the initial hearing. 

Brian and his lawyer contend that the investigation into his son's disappearance hasn't been conducted with competency. They refer to the case of Jacob Wetterling as evidence that the Sheriff's Office has a history of incompetence — Jacob Wetterling went missing for 27 years. It wasn't until Danny Heinrich in 2016 admitted to abducting and killing Jacob Wetterling (as part of a plea deal after being arrested for child pornography) that the case was solved. One-time interim Stearns County Sheriff Don Gudmundson referred to the handling of the Wetterling case as an investigation that went ""off the rails."" 

Brian also argues that, from the start, the Sheriff's Office didn't conduct a full investigation, and instead only focused on theory. 

OK, so here's the Joshua Guimond story: 

Joshua was last seen at a card game on campus at St. John's University on Nov. 9, 2002. He left the gathering to go to the bathroom, but never returned. His friends, who claim he wasn't intoxicated despite having beers, assumed he went back to his apartment building, which was located a three-minute walk away on campus. Alarm bells didn't go off until the next morning when he didn't show up to Mock Trial practice. Josh was co-captain of the Mock Trial team and a dedicated poli sci student with plans to go to law school. Leaving without a trace wasn't like him, his friends say. 

His car remained parked and untouched on campus. His keys, wallet, identification, credit cards, glasses and contact lenses remained in his apartment. It also gets pretty cold in Minnesota in November, and Joshua left the gathering in a hooded sweatshirt. 

Three lakes are located on the campus, including Stumpf Lake, which runs between the two apartments (the one Josh was at for the gathering, and the one in which he lived). When the search for Joshua began on the following Monday, investigators and volunteers searched the wooded area around campus, and the Sheriff's Office focused on finding Joshua's body in the water. 

From that point on, Brian claims they only assumed he drunkenly fell into the water and didn't consider the possibility of foul play, which he believes occurred. Despite the nation's top water crime-based investigative body (The Trident Foundation) clearing the lakes and determining that the investigation should look elsewhere, the focus continued to remain on Joshua's body being in the lake. 

Here's where it gets interesting: St. John's University is a Catholic university that includes The Abbey, which houses Catholic monks. In October 2002, The Abbey quietly settled cases involving several allegations of abuse against abbey monks. Since then, 18 monks with credibly allegations of credible abuse have been named and their files have been released.

687,PrimeVector19,1639077102,"I’m actually a day late with this, so I apologize. 

The disappearance of Trevor Deely is frequently mentioned on this sub, but for those of you who are unfamiliar with his case, here’s a summary below. 

During the early morning hours of December 8th, 2000, Trevor Deely was having a Christmas celebration with some of his co-workers in Dublin, Ireland. Deely and his colleagues had drinks at three different places: Copper Face Jacks, the Hilton Hotel, and Buck Whaley’s. 

At about 3:25 am, Deely left Buck Whaley’s and began walking towards his apartment. There was a heavy storm that night with wind gusts reaching speeds of 60-70 mph; in addition, there was also a taxi strike. 

About ten minutes after he departed Buck Whaley’s, Deely arrived at his office, and he was let in by security. 

CCTV footage showed a still-unidentified man dressed in black waiting for a half hour prior to Deely’s arrival. This man and Deely had a brief conversation. 

Two more men arrived at the gate after Deely entered the building, although those two have since been cleared as colleagues of Deely. 

While inside his office, Deely made himself a cup of tea, spoke to a colleague by the name of Karl Pender, checked his email, and made a note of things to do for his shift the following morning. 

At 4:03 am, Deely left his office, taking an umbrella with him. He continued in the direction of Ballsbridge. He left a voicemail for a friend of his, named Glen. The voicemail was described by his friend was saying “Hi, Glen, I’ve missed you there. Just on my way home, all going good, I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” 

Glen deleted the voicemail, not thinking much of it. 

At 4:14 am, CCTV footage shows Deely walking past the then-AIB Bank on the corner of Baggot Street Bridge and Haddington Road, towards where his flat was. This remains the last confirmed sighting of Trevor Deely. 

About thirty seconds after Deely is last seen, a man in black is seen walking down the same street on CCTV, seemingly following Deely. Authorities believe this is e same man in black who talked to Trevor earlier. No one has ever come forward. 

Some people believe Trevor Deely was a victim of a crime on demand while being at the wrong place at the wrong time; the street he was on was known for gang activity and prostitution. 

Others believe Deely was being stalked as a wanted man. An even smaller number of people believe Deely’s disappearance is linked to the girl he visited in Alaska a few weeks prior. 

What do you think happened to Trevor Deely?

But it is one of those cases that actually never left my human hard drive. Even after consuming everything that was made public (in fact, to learn everything about the case read the Wikipedia article, watch the Fifth Estate Episode and then dive into the fantastic and chilling Series of Podcasts created by the Nighttime Podcast from Canada), Emma or, better, the story of Emma stayed in my mind and I asked myself why I care so much for a person I've never met and, unfortunately, will never meet. I guess one of the main reason is the backstory of her you will learn in the Podcast. Our birthdays are separated by 3 days (yet she is a year older than me) and from what I've heard, she really hated the cold season. Also born in January, I can really confirm this and that this time of the year is also for me the hardest time of the year.

She clearly suffered from a depression and the season was I think a factor for her strange behaviour when she was last seen. What happened after that is, of course, pure speculation.

So, 9 years passed at the end of November 21. I think a little refresher cannot hurt. The Victorian Police released 2 new photos and promised to handle this case still as very important (don't know if this is just PR because they are still riddled with guild that the police offercs had let her go on the day she went missing). Also, the scheduled documentary planned for a release on the 9th anniversary of her disappearance was delayed to 2022 due to the pandemic.

**What happened that day?**

Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home.

Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. 

When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hand. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There’s a bomb, and my dad just blew up!” By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne’s life. He had died almost instantly.

\-----

**Who was Wayne Greavette?**

42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette.

At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. 

\-----

**The Evidence**

This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter.

**The Package**

The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled **[Domaine D’or Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh)**, which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we will get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local.

Apart from this, two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

In the CBC podcast *Someone Knows Something*, the postwoman’s mother (who, alongside her grandson, were riding along as the postwoman did her rounds) said that the package delivered to the Greavette mailbox that day had a very fancy ribbon on it and that it was not at all heavy, as her grandson was able to lift it.

**The Flashlight**

The flashlight used to house the bomb was a Duracell-brand Floating Lantern around 23 cm long and 15 cm tall, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/h7xo02h). According to Justin, the flashlight might have been glued shut, as he was unable to open the flashlight when trying to get it to work. 

A type of mining explosive emulsion called **Superfrac** was used in the bomb. According to investigator Paul Johnson in *Someone Knows Something*, around 1-1.5 pounds (0,5-0,7 kg) of Superfrac was probably used. He also said that Superfrac could be easily bought from the manufacturer without a license, but it was also likely obtained through theft. The bomb was also packed with roofing nails to maximise its destructive effect and was powered by a single-cell AA battery. 

**The Letter and Typewriter**

The letter included in the package was a business proposal and was written by one “William J. French”. In the letter, the writer mentioned that he and his partner were planning to start a new business called “Acton Home Products” in the new year (1997), and that he would like a quote from Greavette on fixing some equipment. The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a [vertical slash](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code ([L7G 2N1](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

However, one thing was chillingly clear: the [postscript](https://imgur.com/a/kH9dxty) of the letter indicated that the writer knew exactly what was going to happen when Wayne switched on the flashlight:

* “Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.**”

\-----

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a [sketch](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

It was suspected (based on the extra postage on the package) that the perpetrator might have dropped the package at a drop-off shoot at the post office or just at a Canada Post mailbox.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

\-----

**Conclusion**

Sunday, 12 December 2021, will be 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

* “Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.**”

\-----

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a [sketch](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

It was suspected (based on the extra postage on the package) that the perpetrator might have dropped the package at a drop-off shoot at the post office or just at a Canada Post mailbox.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

\-----

**Conclusion**

Sunday, 12 December 2021, will be 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

**What happened that day?**

Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home.

Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. 

When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hand. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There’s a bomb, and my dad just blew up!” By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne’s life. He had died almost instantly.

\-----

**Who was Wayne Greavette?**

42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette.

At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. 

\-----

**The Evidence**

This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter.

**The Package**

The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled **[Domaine D’or Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh)**, which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we will get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local.

Apart from this, two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

In the CBC podcast *Someone Knows Something*, the postwoman’s mother (who, alongside her grandson, were riding along as the postwoman did her rounds) said that the package delivered to the Greavette mailbox that day had a very fancy ribbon on it and that it was not at all heavy, as her grandson was able to lift it.

**The Flashlight**

The flashlight used to house the bomb was a Duracell-brand Floating Lantern around 23 cm long and 15 cm tall, similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/h7xo02h). According to Justin, the flashlight might have been glued shut, as he was unable to open the flashlight when trying to get it to work. 

A type of mining explosive emulsion called **Superfrac** was used in the bomb. According to investigator Paul Johnson in *Someone Knows Something*, around 1-1.5 pounds (0,5-0,7 kg) of Superfrac was probably used. He also said that Superfrac could be easily bought from the manufacturer without a license, but it was also likely obtained through theft. The bomb was also packed with roofing nails to maximise its destructive effect and was powered by a single-cell AA battery. 

**The Letter and Typewriter**

The letter included in the package was a business proposal and was written by one “William J. French”. In the letter, the writer mentioned that he and his partner were planning to start a new business called “Acton Home Products” in the new year (1997), and that he would like a quote from Greavette on fixing some equipment. The writer also said that he had met and worked with Greavette in the past. The writer closed the letter by saying that he was looking forward to hearing back from Greavette. You can find the entire letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to [this](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a [vertical slash](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code ([L7G 2N1](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

You can find the entire letter \[here\](https://imgur.com/a/U8SSD3s).

The two names mentioned in the letter – “Lisa” and “Joe” – were real people Wayne knew. “Lisa” was Leesa Ervin, while “Joe” was Giuseppe “Joe” Zottich. Both had worked with Wayne at SERGE Beverage Equipment. Leesa worked as a secretary, while Joe did delivery works.

Based on their analysis, investigators determined that the letter had been typed on a **Smith-Corona electric typewriter** similar to \[this\](https://imgur.com/a/fL3uoZi). The letter was typed in all caps, the font used in the letter was **Script 10/12**, while the daisy wheel (the typing element of the typewriter) used had the number **59543**.

There was an interesting anomaly in the letter that was observed by investigators: probably due to a bent arm in the daisy wheel, there was always a \[vertical slash\](https://imgur.com/a/VFWq3HT) after every period in the letter.

Further analysis of the letter showed that some information had been faked. The letter had been written in a relaxed and friendly tone as if the writer knew Wayne personally. However, no one in the Greavette family knew who “William J. French” was. Moreover, no business under the name “Acton Home Product” was ever created, and the supposed business address (RR #1 Unit #6, Acton, Ontario) did not exist. The postal code (\[L7G 2N1\](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Georgetown,+ON+L7G+2N1,+Canada/@43.6489763,-79.9339318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b72b2613f8cb3:0x27cf5fd5d895e6f6!8m2!3d43.6491439!4d-79.932212)) was from the Marywood Meadows neighbourhood in Georgetown, around 10 km from Acton.

However, one thing was chillingly clear: the \[postscript\](https://imgur.com/a/kH9dxty) of the letter indicated that the writer knew exactly what was going to happen when Wayne switched on the flashlight:

“Didn’t realize you had moved. Had some trouble finding you. **Have a very merry Christmas and may you never have to buy another flashlight.****”**

**-----**

**The Suspects**

Around November 1996, two men had come to the Acton Post Office and asked two different people about the Greavettes’ new address (the Greavettes had moved from Acton to Moffat in June). The OPP produced a \[sketch\](https://imgur.com/a/YuyasBA) of the two men and released it to the public, but neither one of the men was identified.

It was suspected (based on the extra postage on the package) that the perpetrator might have dropped the package at a drop-off shoot at the post office or just at a Canada Post mailbox.

Another person of interest in the investigation was **Ed Galick**. Ed was the owner of SERGE Beverage Equipments, where Wayne used to work and would leave Wayne to look after SERGE whenever he went on vacations. Ed was also very close with the Greavette family, so much so that the Greavette children called him “Uncle Ed”. However, according to Ed in *Someone Knows Something*, Wayne would treat the workers at SERGE “like dirt”, leading to some of the employees quitting. Also, at one point, Diane was working at SERGE, but Ed thought she was not good enough for the business, and he had asked Wayne to fire Diane from SERGE. Ed also claimed that Wayne started stealing money from him (something that Wayne denied) and that he acted weird around him, which he thought resulted from Wayne using hard drugs. This, alongside other things, led to Ed and Wayne falling out around three years before the murder. 

Ed also said that Wayne’s supposed stealing habit continued after he was fired from SERGE, which might be the reason why he was targeted, and also that his son, Ed Jr., with whom he is estranged, might be behind Wayne’s death.

\-----

**Conclusion**

Sunday, 12 December 2021, will be 25 years since Wayne Greavette was brutally murdered in his own house.

There are many unanswered questions around this case. Who wanted Wayne dead so badly that they would construct a bomb to kill him? What did Wayne do to wrong this person that they want to rid the world of him? Why send the letter through the mail? Why not just drop it off at his house? 

I sincerely hope Diane, Justin, and Danielle can find some peace. And that one day, something will be revealed that will once and for all answer the question, “Who killed Wayne Greavette?”

706,Johnknowsnothin,1638989144,"In 1973 A bank robbery in Swedens capital Stockholm turns into a six day hostage situation. During that time the hostages act in a way not previously observed. The begin to side with the hostages and even ask the police and the prime minister to let the robbers go and to let them, the hostages go with them.  
It culminates in a new psychological concept called The Stockholm syndrome, coined by resident psychiatrist Nils Bejerot who was present at the scene for the entire six days. But was the hostages actions that strange? why did they act the way the did? is the Stockholm syndrome even real?

This is a day by day breakdown of the whole hostage situation:

Sweden had recently begun making regular tv broadcasts and the press was allowed everywhere in so most of the drama is captured on film:  
*here is a video if you'd rather watch:* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOpCfBLjYTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOpCfBLjYTQ) 

  
**DAY 1**  
Its Thursday morning, august 23, 1973. At 10 am a disguised man enters Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, In Stockholm armed with a submachine gun and dynamite. He yells ”the party starts” in English but with a noticeable southern Swedish accent. He’s wearing an wig and sunglasses, a fake mustasch and he’s got shoe cream smeared on his face. he’s trying to appear middle eastern. He fires off some rounds into the ceiling.

One of the tellers presses the alarm button and the police respond.  
But the robber doesn’t go for the money and try to escape. Instead he takes 3 women hostage and wait patiently for the police. He has a plan.

a squad car arrives. When the two officers walk in to the bank the masked bank robber opens fire, hitting one officer in the hand. They retreat.  
The police then arrive and set up up a command center. It looks like it’s going to be a stand off.  
They try to send officers in to the bank once again. But they start shooting and the robber returns fire.  
So the police decide call in to the bank and the robber answers. He has the following demands.

\- 3 million in cash.  
\- A ford mustang, like the one Steve McQueen got in the movie Bullitt  
\- Notorious criminal Clark Olofsson realsed from prison and brought to the bank. (Clark Olofsson was at the time one of Swedens most well known criminals and was serving a 6 year sentence for multiple bank robberies and attempted murder on a police officer)

The police forward the demands to Prime minister Olof Palme and Minister of Justice Lennart Geiger. Their response, yeah sure.

Olofsson is promptly picked up from Norrköpingsanstalten and after being promised a certain deal if he can stop the robbery he’s driven to Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm. Where reporters have gathered outside the bank. They are broadcasting live TV and for the first time in Swedish history there is going to be 24 hour live news coverage.

Meanwhile the police are busy doing three things.  
\- Trying to find out who the mysterious robber is   
\- Giving live interviews on TV and radio on every move they’re going to make  
\- Trying to find different ways to get in to the bank to subdue the robber.

But he seems to be one step ahead of the police at every turn.   
Because he’s listening to the police being interviewed on the radio.

The Police decide to search his known associates and their eye lands on Kaj Hansson, Olofssons former partner in crime, a bank robber, from the south of Sweden (that explains the accent) that is currently on the run from prison. Got him.

**DAY 2**

After being allowed to walk in to the bank the prio evening Olofsson hugged the robber. They’re obviously friends. But the police now have two bank robbers in the bank instead of one. And Olofsson doesn’t convince the robber to give up- Classic backfire.   
Instead he walks around the bank and finds yet another hostage hiding in the back.  
They now have 3 women and one man held captive.

Since police negotiators are not a thing yet the police decide to bring in an expert on prison lingo.  
He calls and using prison slang tries to get them to release the hostages. The robber has no idea what the hell he’s saying. 

Instead Nils bejerot, resident psychiatrist and advisor to the police has a great idea. Bring Kaj Hanssons brother in and let him convince Hansson to give up.   
They find Hanssons brother fly him and his mother to Stockholm. They send him in to the bank while his mother makes a plea live on the radio.

Bejerot escorts the brother to the door and he walks into the bank and down stairs. He’s met with sub machine gun fire. Frightened he runs back up. He doesn’t like the idea of being shot. Bejerot reassures him. ""Tell your brother it’s you, Your brother wouldn’t shoot you"". So he walks down the stairs again only to have bullets wiz by inches from his face and hit the concrete wall behind him.  
The robber yells, get the fuck out of here. Bejerot is confused.  
But then the phone at the command center rings. It’s Kaj Hansson. He calling from a beach in Hawaii and he is very much not the robber. Further more he doesn’t appreciate his name being besmirched (even though he is a bank robber, on the run from a prison sentence for bank robbery).  
He’s promptly arrested by American police and brought back home.

So who’s the robber? The police have been so focused on Kaj Hansson that they’ve ignored tips about another potential suspect.  
His name is Jan-Erik ”Janne” Olsson, a 31 year old small time criminal from Ekeby. (South Sweden it checks out) This time they really have got the right guy. But why is he robbing a bank?   
Well Olsson has just spent a year in prison with Olofsson and he loved the cool stories about Bank robberies Olofsson would tell him.  
So obviously the best thing to do was to break him out of prison and go on a bank robbery tour across the country.

They’re off to a bad start.

**DAY 3**

An officer acting on his own initiative fires his gun a couple of times in to the air to wake up the robbers who are asleep inside the bank. It scares the hell out of the robbers, the hostages the press and the police. Everyone ducks for cover.  
When asked why he did it, he tells reporters that he’s ""kind of a loose cannon"". Great answer.

The requested mustang has arrived and is sitting outside the bank.  
The police have snipers on the roof, ordered to fire if Olsson tries to get to the car. Which is illegal. You can’t shoot somebody who’s running away if they’re not risking a life according the swedish law.

Olsson and Olofsson have retreated to the vault in the basement with the hostages to get away from police. The want to leave with two of them in the car but the police decline the offer. You can go, but without the hostages. The robbers decline the offer. And around they go.  
Until one officer again acting on his own initiative decides to sneak in to the bank and close the vault door.  
The robbers and the hostages are now locked in. without access to food, water or a bathroom.

The press, thirsting for new information during their broadcast realize that there is a phone in the vault. They call and talk to the robbers and the hostages live on TV.  
One of the hostages then uses the phone to call the prime minister.  
She ask him to let the the robbers leave with her in the car. He declines. She explain that the polices erratic behavior is making her feel more unsafe than the robbers are. Our dear prime minister finally says that they don’t negotiate with criminals, but wouldn’t it feel good to die at your post? Like she in the military in a war zone, she works in a bank.  
She says if you don’t want to give the robbers what they want, then you can come down here and trade places with us. Thank you and good bye and then she hangs up the phone.  
Unsurprisingly Palme doesn’t show up to trade places with the hostages.

**DAY 4**

The police decide to drill a hole in the roof of the vault from above to lower down food and water. They call it operation K. Because every good plan has to have a name.

To prevent Operation K Olsson orders one of the hostages to lay down underneath the drill so when police break through the roof she’ll get a big slab of concrete right in her head. Great plan, except the police obviously can’t see in to the vault and they just keep drilling.  
Olsson finally realizes. And she gets to move. When the police break through they send down a camera on a stick to get a look at the place. Then they drop down some food and continue negotiations. Because despite the prime ministers say, they obviously do negotiate with criminals.

The robbers want to leave in the car with the hostages. The police decline. They in turn says that they can leave but without the hostages. The robbers decline. And around they go.

**DAY 5**

You wanna come out? 

Can we bring the hostages

No

Ok, No.

(Basically)

**DAY 6**

The police have been receiving some great tips from the public on how to solve the situation. One person suggest sending a swarm of hornets in to the vault, another to fill it with ping pong balls so they can’t move. Yet Another to just toss a hand grenade down there, that’ll stop the robbers. And Mikael age 10 writes a letter to the police suggesting that they stand over the hole with a gun and shooting the robber when he walks by.  
But the robbers are as always one step ahead. When a young officer stands above the hole, olsson fires a shot hitting him in the hand and the face. He lives.

The police have had it and they decide to use gas to subdue the robbers. What kind of gas? It’s never been established. The police don’t wanna say.

The gas is deployed through the whole in the roof, and within seconds the robber surrender. Two officers with no shirts on open the vault door once it’s unlocked and capture olsson and Olofsson. And the whole ordeal comes to an end after 6 days. 

In the aftermath the following happens.  
It’s discovered that an unknown amount of money is missing from the bank.  
Nils Bejerot explains that since the female hostages sided with the robbers, were okay with going with them in the getaway car and seemed to be afraid of the police they were obviously in love with the robbers and thus the Stockholm syndrome was created.

Janne olsson was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the robbery.  
Clark Olofsson was also sentenced to 5,5 years in prison for the robbery.

Opon appeal he was acquitted when it was discovered that the police had promised him a certain deal. ” if you make sure no hostages are hurt you’ll get a six week furlough from prison. You can rob a bank and flee the country if you want to”. (Actual quote)

**The Stockholm Syndrome:**

One of the stars of the (shit)show was Nils bejerot. The man who almost got Kaj Hanssons brother killed and traumatized him to this day. He was very much involved and giving tips based on his analysis of the robbers psyche throughout the whole drama.   
And when the whole ordeal was over he diagnosed the hostages with what he called Norrmalmstorssyndromet which would later become the stockholm syndrome.

The condition where captives develop positive feelings and a psychological bond with their captors. It is intended to describe a psychological state in which those who are being held hostage begin to relate to their captor and see them as the good guys and the police as the bad guys.

in this case however the behavior of the hostages seems perfectly reasonable, here are just some points that dispute the diagnosis.

\- I understand Olofsson is a bad guy, but you can’t send him in to a hostage situation, what if the robber just wanted him there to kill him. and you definitely can’t charge him with robbery for his trouble. The hostages mention this as sympathetic in subsequent interviews.  
In the aftermath nobody was willing to take responsibility for making the deal with Olofsson or sending snipers up on the roof to take out olsson. Those are unsolved mysteries.

\- Sweden was like one big village in the 70s and crimes of this magnitude was basically non existent. There were no procedures or negotiators until 20 years later in the mid 90s which is was caused most of the problems. police officers just walked around giving interviews and officers not on duty came down just to hang out at the command center. Nobody knew who was giving the orders or which orders to follow and some took matters into their own hands with disastrous (and hilarious) Consequences. This made the police seem erratic and dangerous in the eyes of the hostages.

\- Prime minister Palme talked to the hostages and the robbers for a total of 50 minutes. 20 minutes of that recorded conversation was then edited out. So there’s no proof that he said wouldn’t it be nice to die at your post except for the testimony of the hostages and robbers.   
If you ask me, he definitely said that shit. This statement by the prime minister made the hostages feel like the state and the police where not really trying to save their lives.

From these points it wouldn't seem unreasonable to start to see the police as the bad guys.

Another problem with Bejerots diagnosis is that he never actually met or talked to the victims and one of the hostages Kristin Enemark publicity criticized Bejerot saying that she didn’t develop any psychological bond with the robbers at all. Being friendly and on their side was just her strategy, to avoid being hurt or caught in the crossfire.  
Which actually worked. Olsson later revealed that the bond he developed with the hostages made him unwilling to kill or hurt them.

Stockholm syndrome isn’t part of the DSM-5, and a 2008 literary review revealed that ""most diagnoses \[of Stockholm syndrome\] are made by the media, not by psychologists or psychiatrists in therapy. 

The whole thing seems dubious at best and it is founded on a complete misunderstanding of the situation and without a clinical diagnosis. So maybe the Stockholm syndrome as a concept should just be left by the way side?

710,mkultra5252,1638982392,"At the time of her death in 1986, Christy Lynn Floyd was just 16 years old.

In August 2020, police identified Christy as Chesterfield County Jane Doe, whose body was found on August 7, 1986 in Richmond, Virginia.

Born around 1970, Christy and her older sister Kim grew up together in a foster home in Lexington, Virginia. As the two grew up into young teenagers, they became incredibly close but strived desperately to know their biological mother. Determined, the two sisters one day ran away from their foster home, returning to live with their mom in Richmond.

By all accounts, Christy settled into her new home well. She was kind, sweet, and quiet, and reportedly had a love for animals. In her free time, she could often be found dancing the night away with her sister at a popular teenage hang out spot, The Cellar Door, playing basketball for her high school team, and working at the local Hardee’s to earn some extra cash. 

Two weeks before her disappearance in June 1986, 16-year-old Christy began dating an 18-year-old young man that she had met while working at Hardee’s. The couple evidently fell hard and fast for each other, and Christy ran away from home one night to stay in a hotel with her boyfriend. Her mother immediately realized Christy was missing, so she called the boyfriend’s family to demand that Christy come home or else she would press statutory rape charges since her daughter was a minor. 

Christy complied and returned home the next morning, but she wouldn’t be there for long. Shortly after Christy came home, her mother fell asleep and her sister left to get food. When Kim returned, she found Christy gone, and the home’s back door and alley gate left open. 

Christy’s mother and sister immediately filed a missing person’s report, but felt that police never took their claim seriously. Sadly, two months later on August 7, 1986, workers at a local landfill found the remains that would eventually be identified as Christy while unloading trash collected from a Richmond garbage dumpster. Prior to disposing of her, police believe that Christy’s killer kept her remains in a refrigerator or semi-air tight container to delay decomposition. 

After remaining a Jane Doe for decades, police identified Chesterfield County Jane Doe as Christy in 2020. For years, Kim relentlessly searched for her sister, putting Christy’s face on milk cartons, passing out missing person’s flyers, and submitting her sister’s information to the popular television show “America’s Most Wanted.” In remembering her sister, Kim said, “She was amazing. She was my world. She was like my child, and I feel like I failed her.” 

Her killer is still unknown to this day. Sadly, neither her mother or sister know the identity of the young man Christy was dating and ran away to be with at the time of her disappearance. Anyone with leads is encouraged to contact Chesterfield County Unsolved/Major Investigations Group at 804-717-6024.

After more than three decades, Christy has finally been returned to her family.

The sheriff further noted that, as Kyle was an only child and his parents have both passed away, only distant relatives remain.  The creek where the car was found apparently doesn't have a specific name.

Second edit: photos of the recovered car: [https://www.cbs46.com/kyle-clinkscales-car/image\_7ee91f7c-584c-11ec-9512-e7fe52588643.html](https://www.cbs46.com/kyle-clinkscales-car/image_7ee91f7c-584c-11ec-9512-e7fe52588643.html)

I'm not sure if we're allowed to link to YouTube, but that's the only place I could find the press conference; you can find a video of the press conference by searching for ""Cold case update Troup County sheriff discusses new development"" on the 11 Alive YouTube channel.

&amp;#x200B;

The car of Kyle Clinkscales, an Auburn student who went missing in 1976, has been located in a creek in  Chambers County, Alabama.  Clinkscales was from Georgia, and was a student at Auburn University in Alabama when he disappeared after leaving his bartending job at the Moose Club in LaGrange, Georgia.

[https://www.wrbl.com/news/vehicle-of-missing-auburn-university-student-located-in-44-year-old-cold-case/](https://www.wrbl.com/news/vehicle-of-missing-auburn-university-student-located-in-44-year-old-cold-case/)

[https://www.wrbl.com/news/troup-county-sheriff-sets-news-conference-to-share-major-development-in-cold-case/](https://www.wrbl.com/news/troup-county-sheriff-sets-news-conference-to-share-major-development-in-cold-case/)

There have been several theories and claims made about Clinkscales' disappearance over the years.  In 1981, a man claiming to suffer amnesia due to a 1976 car accident came forward claiming to be Clinkscales, but this was ruled out upon a comparison of dental records.

In 2005, Clinkscales' parents received a phone call from someone who claimed that, as a child, he (the caller) had witnessed his grandfather disposing of a body that had been sealed with concrete inside a barrel.  This phone call led to the investigation of Jimmy Earl Jones and Jeanne Pawlak Johnson, who were both thought to be present during or immediately after the murder of Clinkscales at the hands of a local ne'er do well named Ray Hyde, with Clinkscale's body then being buried in Hyde's salvage yard.  However, searches of Hyde's property did not reveal any remains.  (It's not clear if either Jones or Hyde was the supposed grandfather, and I can't tell if the phone call itself led directly to the investigation of Jones, Johnson, and Hyde, or if it merely got the investigation going again.  /u/beardchester's post, linked below, has much more high-quality information than I have here.)  Hyde was never charged, as this information did not come to light until 2005, by which point Hyde had already died (in 2001).  ~~Johnson~~ Jones, however, was sentenced to 9 years for his role in covering up Clinkscale's death.  (Sorry; I mixed up Johnson and Jones earlier; Jones was the one who served 9 years and has since been released.)

To date, Clinkscales' remains have not been found, and there has been no report yet as to whether there are any human remains in the newly-recovered white 1974 Ford Pinto belonging to Clinkscales.  There is a press conference scheduled for this morning (Wednesday, December 8th); I couldn't find a specific time or link to the scheduled press conference, unfortunately, but hopefully some more information will make its way into the news later today.  One article did report that the sheriff said he'd have ""additional information"" at the press conference, but it wasn't clear if he meant additional info as in, ""evidence or remains we may have found in the car,"" or just ""more details about the process of discovering the car in the creek.""  I hope there's something in the recent discovery of the car that will help in bringing some final resolution to the case; sadly, Kyle's parents have since passed away (his father in 2007, his mother just this year), but it would be nice for Kyle's remains to be found so he could be interred close to his parents.

I know this isn't a ton of new information besides ""they found his car,"" but I recognized Kyle's photo and name immediately when I saw it pop-up in the sidebar of a different news story I was reading, and I wanted to share this update for anyone else who has followed the case.

712,MistressGravity,1638972314,"Hey guys, I have written a bit about this case in my [region-locked cases write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/ra7p3j/what_are_some_regionlocked_unsolved_cases/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). Still, I want to expand further on it, include more details because of its disturbing nature, and provoke discussion about who could be behind all of this and why she was targeted. 

So, without further ado, this is the unsolved abduction and murder of Maria Bögerl. Pardon my writing skill, as this is my first comprehensive write-up of a single case. Also, English is not my first language.

TW: Suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who was Maria Bögerl?**

[Maria Bögerl](https://www.thelocal.com/20100514/27193/) was a special education teacher and the wife of Thomas Bögerl, a banker and head of a *Kreissparkasse* (a type of local savings bank in Germany). They had two children, Carina (27) and Christoph (24) and the family lived in the Schnaitheim district of Heidenheim, in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

**Timeline of events**

&amp;#x200B;

· **12 May 2010:** 

**Around 10:30 am:** Christoph called Maria at around 10:30 am. He told her that he was on his way home from college, and she asked him what he would like for lunch. This was the last anyone heard from her. Sometime after this call, Maria was kidnapped by person(s) unknown from her house. The kidnapper(s) took her in her car, a black 2009 Mercedes A-Class with the license number HDH-MB 770. 

**Around 11:25 - 11:30 am:** Thomas received a phone call from someone, presumably the kidnapper, asking for a ransom of €300,000 (just under $340,000 in 2021) in specific denominations (I was not able to find which particular denominations were asked for). The caller demanded that the money be dropped off within one and a half hours (around 1 pm). Thomas asked for an extension, which was agreed upon, and the deadline was set at 3 pm. During this call, Thomas was able to speak to his wife for a short time, during which she relayed to him that she had been threatened with death. At this point, Thomas alerted the Heidenheim police.

**3:27 pm:** Thomas managed to secure the ransom money and dropped it at a pre-arranged [spot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B046'09.1%22N+10%C2%B012'35.5%22E/@48.769182,10.209851,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x176d7454081330cc!8m2!3d48.769182!4d10.209851?hl=en) by the A7 Autobahn, marked by a German flag. However, due to delays in obtaining the cash, the drop-off occurred half an hour after the deadline (around 3:27 pm, to be exact). The money was never picked up, and the ransom caller never called again.

&amp;#x200B;

· **14 May 2010:** Maria's car was found abandoned in the parking lot of [Neresheim Abbey](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neresheim+Abbey,+Kloster+11,+73450+Neresheim,+Germany/@48.7558776,10.3415229,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x479924c08000f849:0xb06f8d1d7312fd1f!8m2!3d48.7558741!4d10.3437116), approximately 22 km NW of Heidenheim. Traces of blood were found in the vehicle. Later on, her cellphone was found near the money drop-off site.

Police launched a massive search for Maria, under the belief that she was alive but in extreme danger. More than 350 officers, 100 search dogs, and two helicopters equipped with FLIR cameras were deployed in the search. At one point, members of a local geocaching club and a mountain rescue crew were also involved in the search.

&amp;#x200B;

· **18 May 2010:** The reward for information leading to Maria's return was doubled to €100,000 (just over $110,000 in 2021). A task force called ""Flagge"" (Flag) was formed, and around 80 officers from the *Landeskriminalamt* (State Criminal Investigation Office) were tasked to find Maria.

&amp;#x200B;

· **19 May 2010:** The remaining Bögerl family members (Thomas, his son, and daughter) appeared in the monthly German crime show ""Aktenzeichen XY… ungelöst"" (transl. ""Case number XY...Unsolved) where they plead for Maria's safe return. ""We beg you to help us end this excruciating ordeal on a positive note,"" said Thomas. You can find the segment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XHMaxOV4DU&amp;t=3s), but there is no English sub.

&amp;#x200B;

· **21 May 2010:** The ground search for Maria was suspended. Investigators were now looking into whether a disgruntled customer of the bank where Thomas worked may have been behind the kidnapping.

&amp;#x200B;

· **3 June 2010:** A hiker found the remains of a middle-aged woman covered with branches and leaves in a [forest](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=48.776857,10.199249&amp;z=16&amp;t=m&amp;q=48.776857,10.199249&amp;hl=en) about 10 km north of Heidenheim (and approx. 1 km from the drop-off site). The area where the body was found had been searched weeks prior. A day later, police announced that the body had been positively identified as Maria Bögerl. She had died of multiple stab wounds, and an autopsy showed that she had most likely died within hours of her abduction.

The police also released more details about the ransom caller. The person was described as a male, likely middle-aged and talked with a Swabian accent (Swabia is a region in southern Germany, located about 100 km SE of Heidenheim).

&amp;#x200B;

· **6 June 2010:** The residents of Heidenheim turned out to mourn Maria Bögerl's death. More than 900 people came to pay their respect at a memorial service at the church.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, Maria's murder would not be the end of the Bögerl family's suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

· **11 June 2011:** Just over a year after Maria's body was found, 57-year-old Thomas Bögerl was found dead by his housekeeper around noon. He had committed suicide by hanging himself. He had been battling severe depression following his wife's death, to the point that he had to admit himself into a mental health ward. He left a suicide note behind, the details of which have not been disclosed.

&amp;#x200B;

· **14 June 2011:** Thomas was laid to rest beside his wife. At his funeral, the Bögerl children heavily criticised the media for their handling of the case, particularly for spreading salacious and unfounded rumours about Thomas, both regarding his personal life (how his marriage was pretty much over and that he and Maria were getting a divorce, how he had cheated on her, and how he had fathered an illegitimate child) and his involvement in the crime. None of these rumours was remotely true, but they were enough to get Thomas fired from his job and, by all accounts, pushed him over the edge.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The investigation**

&amp;#x200B;

During the initial phase of the investigation (16 May, to be exact), a man was arrested for Maria's kidnapping (it was still considered that at the time). He was let go a short time later. The events that took place during the investigation will be presented in the following timeline:

&amp;#x200B;

· **April 2012:** Police searched an area in the woods near where Maria's body was found. It was not clear what, if anything, was found during the search.

&amp;#x200B;

· **2013:** Following another episode of *Aktenzeichen XY* discussing the case, a man came forward claiming to have information about the case. This turned out to be false; the man was lying to the police for seven months. He was eventually found out, arrested, and sentenced to 2 years probation for fraud (he was given €5,000 for the false information he provided).

&amp;#x200B;

· **20 January 2014:** Investigators announced that a DNA dragnet would be initiated around the area where Maria's car was found (the Neresheim Abbey), which would start in February 2014. All men born between 1 January 1945 and 31 December 1992 (between 23-69 years old) and living in the area between 1 January 2010 and late October 2013 would be asked to give a sample of their DNA voluntarily. This translated to around 3,000 people who would be included in the dragnet.

&amp;#x200B;

· **14 February 2014:** The aforementioned DNA dragnet was initiated.

· **August 2014:** The DNA dragnet was widened to include men between 21-68 in [Giengen an der Brenz]( https://www.google.com/maps/place/Giengen,+Germany/@48.6172309,10.1751832,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47993f206aa0c70f:0x2e0a95b369c17178!8m2!3d48.6223985!4d10.2391536), around 15 km SE of Heidenheim. Around 5,000 people were asked to submit a DNA sample.

&amp;#x200B;

· **January 2016:** Task Force ""Flagge"" was disbanded. The investigation was transferred to a smaller team at the Ulm Police Service.

&amp;#x200B;

· **5 April 2017:** The *Bundeskriminalamt* (BKA), Germany's federal criminal investigative body, announced that a suspect is being sought for Maria's murder. The suspect was a 45-year-old man from Königsbronn, located just north of Heidenheim. He was around 180 cm (6 ft) tall, with black hair, stubble, and a mole under his right eye. He was described as appearing unkempt.

On 26 July 2016, the man had drunkenly approached two passersby in the town of Hagen (located in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia). He started confessing to them that he was involved in Maria's murder. The man's confession was recorded by one of the passersby. When the police arrived, the man was gone. The BKA claimed that the man had talked about the crimes that were withheld from the public. [This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20170405171122/https://www.bka.de/DE/IhreSicherheit/Fahndungen/Personen/UnbekanntePersonen/PPUlm\_Mord\_MB/MB.html) contains a composite picture of the man.

&amp;#x200B;

· **6 April 2017:** The BKA announced that a man had been arrested for Maria's murder. It was indeed the man described in the appeal released the day prior. The man was mentally unstable and admitted that he hated the Bögerl family. However, the man was released without charges later that day. His DNA did not match the sample taken from the crime scene. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Allegations and Grave Mistakes.**

&amp;#x200B;

Could Maria's life have been saved? According to a [report](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/fall-boegerl-polizeipanne-kein-loesegeld-wegen-mittagspause-1.982889) by *Stern* magazine, yes. The report suggests that police did not alert the nearest *Bundesbank* (a branch of the German Central Bank) in Ulm, about 30 km SW of Heidenheim, about the fact that they would require them to prepare €300,000 to pay the kidnapper(s) (the *Bundesbank* is the designated institution where law enforcement would get the ransom in cases of kidnapping). As a result, the bank was closed for a lunch break, as was usually the case, when two employees of *Kreissparkasse Heidenheim* (where Thomas worked) arrived at the *Bundesbank* at 1:15 pm. It took another half an hour (1:45 pm) for the employees to acquire the money. By the time Thomas dropped the money off beside the A7, he was half an hour late.

The police, on the other hand, [claimed]([https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/mord-an-bankiersfrau-polizei-dementiert-vorwuerfe-im-fall-boegerl-a-699544.html](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/mord-an-bankiersfrau-polizei-dementiert-vorwuerfe-im-fall-boegerl-a-699544.html)) that Thomas was to blame for the late drop-off.  They said Thomas insisted on getting the money himself, without the police involved. They also said he refused to leave for the drop-off site with only a partial ransom (less than €300,000) and a note explaining the situation, even though the 3 pm deadline was fast approaching. Thomas steadfastly denied these allegations.

The Bögerl children also accused the police of failing to help their father. In a 2012 [interview](https://www.zeitenspiegel.de/de/projekte/interview/vom-ende-einer-familie/article/) with the *Stern* magazine, they presented their version of events and alleged that the process was bungled from the start because Thomas was left entirely alone to gather the cash for the ransom. According to Carina Bögerl, the head of Task Force ""Flagge"", said at one point, ""If a bank director cannot do that (i.e. get the ransom money), who can?"" 

In the same interview, it was also revealed that police had developed tunnel vision for Christoph Bögerl and Carina's live-in partner. They suspected that both had contacted the kidnapper(s) in the days leading to the kidnapping. The police searched their houses and tapped both Christoph's and Carina's partner's cellphones, and many calls were recorded, including those with a priest and a lawyer. Their suspicions were soon proven wrong, as they were based on data stored with incorrect timestamps on their phones. Following these revelations, the prosecuting authority in charge of the case announced that no one in the Bögerl family was being investigated as a suspect.

The Bögerl children also admitted that in retrospect, their appearance in the *Aktenzeichen XY* episode did more harm than good, as it only fuelled the fire on the theory that the family was somehow involved in Maria's disappearance.

Then there was the matter about Maria's body. The place where her remains were found had been searched some time prior. It was suggested through the autopsy that Maria had died not long after she was abducted and that her body had spent a considerable amount of time at the dumping location. Which led to the question, why wasn't her body discovered during the earlier search?

The police also seemed to have completely dropped the ball with trivial things. The ransom money remained where it was dumped until the following day (13 May), when they were removed, not by police or the kidnapper(s), but by highway maintenance workers. Also, it took the police four months to start looking for forensic evidence in the garage where Maria's car was on the day of the kidnapping, and that happened only after the family repeatedly asked them to do it. Christoph also claimed that he only found out about his mother's body being discovered by reading the news, not by anyone from the investigation telling him directly.

All of this is just a very long way of saying that, no matter how you paint it, there were massive errors made by law enforcement in the initial stage of the investigation. And Maria paid for those errors with her life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&amp;#x200B;

More than 11 years have passed since Maria Bögerl was kidnapped and killed. The police have plenty of leads and DNA evidence, but the perpetrator(s) is/are still on the lam. 

Which leads us back to the question at the top: who kidnapped Maria Bögerl and murdered her in cold blood?

Her identification was made by Parabon Nanolabs and the LSU Faces lab.

From NBC:

&gt;A woman who was likely murdered and had her body dumped in a Davie canal in 1975 has remained unidentified for nearly 46 years, but now cold case investigators say they've identified her.

&gt;The woman's body was discovered in a canal in the 2600 block of Southwest 154th Avenue on Dec. 23, 1975.

&gt;At a news conference Tuesday, Davie Police said they identified her as Carolyn Dunn Moudy, of Indianola, Mississippi.

&gt;Moudy's daughter, Edna, spoke briefly at the news conference to thank investigators.

&gt;""I just thank God that I got courage and know now, cause all these years I was just trying to search for her but I'm just thankful,"" Edna Moudy said. ""She's in my heart.""

&gt;Last year, police had released a digital composite of the unidentified woman. Officials said advances in DNA technology helped identify her as Moudy.

&gt;A genetic genealogist was able to use the DNA to track down family members, who said Moudy had gone missing in July 1974.

&gt;A local anthropologist talks about the work she did with police to create a digital facial approximation of a woman who was murdered back in 1975. NBC 6's Alyssa Hyman reports.

&gt;Police had previously said the Broward Medical Examiner’s Office had determined the cause of death was drowning and the circumstances surrounding the case suggested homicide.

&gt;Officials said Tuesday that a homicide investigation is ongoing.

&gt;""Our detectives were relentless in identifying Carolyn and will now work towards bringing justice to her and her family as this investigation continues,"" Davie Police Chief Steve Kinsey said.

I see a lot of cases get brought up on this thread as 'unsolved' despite the fact that there has already been a conviction made. People are absolutely wrongly accused and convicted of crimes, but I don’t think it is as prevalent as people may believe. 

I also think that some cases ([Steven Avery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Avery) comes to mind) have such bad police practices that it taints the evidence and leads to doubt. Other cases rely on a lot of circumstantial evidence ([Scott Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Peterson)) and once again, I think that puts doubt in people’s minds (I was one of those people until I started listening to [The Prosecutors Podcast](https://prosecutorspodcast.com/) and their explanations of circumstantial evidence has really made me see the value of it).

Out of all these cases however, are there any that you do truly believe the person convicted is innocent? Or even the person found innocent is actually guilty?",UnresolvedMysteries,"There are a lot of solved cases that get brought up on this thread. Are there any of those cases that you truly feel like are still unsolved, despite there being a conviction/trial?",1
722,moondog151,1638919525,"It was November 28, 2008, and excavators alongside other workers were mobilized to the Daehangno neighbourhood of Seoul The South Korean Capital. The reason for the excavators being sent was to work on the demolition of the main office of The Korea International Cooperation Agency in that neighbourhood. As they carried out their work one of the workers noticed a pile of human bones at the bottom of a dirt pit located in the basement of the building. All the workers soon halted their work and notified the police.

The police soon arrived and started a murder investigation suspecting that the bones belonged to a single dismembered body as the remains were cut up. However they soon changed this hypothesis after determining that the bones belonged to 10-15 different bodies, so the police instead just informed the prosecution that this was just a strange unnatural death and that the matter likely wasn't a criminal matter or if it was it would've been too old for any suspects to be arrested due to either already being dead or due to the statute of limitations.

The question however remained. Who were these people and why were they buried in a mass grave?

Various theories have been considered some more likely than others.

After the police determined it not to be a criminal investigation the first seriously considered hypothesis is that the remains belonged to Korean soldiers killed in the Korean War.

The site where The Korea International Cooperation Agency Office Building once lay was the site of a violent battle between North and South Korean forces with the North Korean military attempting to invade the city of Seoul while the South Korean forces tried to repel them. During the war and invasion the North Korean army would kill any wounded South Korean soldiers and anti-communist they came across. Once word of this discovery reached them the South Korean army known as the ROK sent a KIA Recovery and Identification team to the site to conduct an investigation and possibly identify the soldiers.

The KIA team stayed at the site for only 14 days before leaving. They determined that these were unlikely to be the remains of ROK soldiers killed in battle. They came to this conclusion because there were no artifacts at the scene to substantiate this claim. Nowhere on the remains or in the surrounding area did the KIA recover any firearms, bullets, combat uniforms or accessories. Furthermore, when the remains themselves were inspected there were no gunshot wounds or any other wounds that would indicate that these people died in combat. That's not to say that nothing was recovered at the scene though as during the excavation of the site a Japanese ink bottle and the sole of a boot were found. However, this sole did not belong to the boots worn by American or ROK troops. Furthermore, the remains did not match the body type or age that most ROK soldiers were with women and even a child being amongst the remains.

After this, the third suggested theory was that these belonged to civilians massacred by North Korean Troops or prisoners and political dissidents that the ROK and police killed soon after the Korean War ended.

After this was suggested The Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission was contacted to investigate the mass grave however they soon dismissed this theory as well for much the same reason that the KIA dismissed their theory. There was no evidence or nothing left behind such as bullets that would align with this being a civilian massacre as well as there being no gunshot wounds on any of the bodies. Truth and Reconciliation Commission soon closed their investigation determining that these were not civilians will by the ROK back when South Korea was a dictatorship.

The KIA and The Truth and Reconciliation Commission both believed that these remains belonged to medical cadavers likely from The Seoul National University that had been disposed of (And thus not a matter that warranted their involvement) so the police decided to launch an investigation however they found out that the university cremated all their cadavers and had surviving records to prove this meaning that yet again this theory had to be ruled out.

It was then suggested that these were the remains of Koreans that the Imperial Japanese Empire/Army committed biological experiments on during wartime and occupation. Or that they were medical cadavers used by the Kyungsung Imperial University

This was the last suggested theory to explain the mass grave however yet again it seemed it was not to be. There seemed to be no surviving records that the Japanese buried the remains of their experimentation subjects at this site and furthermore, when the bodies were examined further they showed no traces of being infected by any sort of pathogens or disease.

And as for the now-defunct Kyungsung Imperial University, their records seemed to survive and there was no evidence that a child was amongst the cadavers they tested on. Furthermore, after the liberation of Korea from Japan, their cadavers were recovered and all were cremated and given a funeral.

Eventually, the police who had been doing most of the investigation handed all the remains over to The National Forensic Service and on March 26, 2009, they finally came to a conclusion.

Based on the fact that a medical saw was used to dismember some of the bodies The National Forensic Service disagreed with the police's assessment and figured that the bodies were in fact cadavers from the Kyungsung Imperial University. They also determined that the site they were found in was not the site of their deaths and that the police's initial count of 10 - 15 remains was inaccurate and that there were 28 bodies at the site instead. They came to this conclusion because after reassembling all of the skeletons they realized that there were some bones not belonging to a complete body and that the DNA test returned 28 characteristics. The conclusions also shed more light on the remains.16 of the remains belonged to adults.

1 belonged to a young adult male.

11 belonged to children (including infants) with 4 of the children being male, 5 female and 2 unidentified.

The estimated time of their deaths was 50 - 100 years ago.

Some animal bones were mixed with the human remains.

As mentioned a saw is believed to be the instrument used to dismember the bodies.

None of the bodies seemed to be related to one another and there were no signs of murder on any of them.

Officially the case is considered closed with the remains being determined to belong to cadavers from The Kyungsung Imperial University however this case is still labelled by many others to be unsolved or at least not fully resolved such as the Kyungsung Imperial University bodies being cremated, no records of a mass grave at this site by the Japanese and the remains showing no signs of illness or infection by pathogens. And regardless of what theory is correct all of these bodies remain unidentified.

Eventually, it seems that this theory presented by The National Forensic Service was also dismissed as the case was handed to the district office who closed their investigation without ever giving a clear conclusion and in May 2021 this case was talked about on TV by the SBS Current Affairs Program which yet again treated this incident as unsolved.

The remains were likely cremated in 2019

On September 3, 1989 the owners of the Good ‘n Loud Music store on University Avenue in Madison, Wisconsin, while removing a leaky boiler in the basement, saw a skull through a pipe connecting the boiler to the chimney. Further investigation by authorities revealed a complete human skeleton. The skeleton was dressed in feminine clothing and wore an iron cross necklace. During the forensic autopsy the remains were determined to be that of a White/Caucasian male, 18-35 years old, about 5’ 7″ tall. There was no way the person could have gotten into the pipe from within the building.

**Circumstances of Disappearance:**

Laureen resided with her mother, Judith Rahn, in a third-floor apartment on Merrimack Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. She was a student at Parkside Junior High School and made good grades.

Judith's then-boyfriend was a professional tennis player, and he and Judith were out of town at a tennis tournament when Laureen disappeared on April 26, 1980. She normally accompanied them, but that day she had asked to be allowed to stay home and her mother agreed. This was during spring break at Laureen's school.

That evening, Laureen, a male friend and a female friend spent some time drinking beer and wine in Laureen's apartment. The boy later stated he heard voices in the hallway and left through the back door because he thought Judith was coming home and he was afraid he would get in trouble. He heard Laureen lock the door behind him.

When Judith arrived home at midnight, she noticed that the light bulbs in hallways on all three floors of the apartment building had been unscrewed and everything was dark. Her own apartment's front door was unlocked. Judith checked Laureen's room and thought she saw her in bed.

In the morning, however, Judith discovered that it was not Laureen but her girlfriend asleep in her room. Laureen was gone, her clothes and brand new sneakers were in the living room, and the back door was open. Her friend stated she'd last seen her sleeping on the couch.

Although the police initially suspected Laureen was a runaway, Judith didn't believe her daughter had left on her own because Laureen had left behind her clothes and purse. Within a few weeks investigators reconsidered the runaway theory. They stated it appeared as if Laureen had left the apartment willingly and intended to return within a short time.

Judith discovered that she had been charged for three California phone calls on October 1, 1980, three months after Laureen disappeared. Judith did not have any friends or relatives in California at the time, and Laureen had never lived there and had no ties to the area.

Two of the calls had been placed from a motel in Santa Monica to another motel in Santa Ana. The third call was placed to a teen sexual assistance hotline. The physician who maintained the hotline at first denied knowing anything about it, but in 1985 he changed his story.

The doctor said that numerous runaway girls occasionally visited his wife at their home and one of the young women may have been from New Hampshire. The individual claimed that Annie Sprinkle, a woman who allegedly worked with his wife in the fashion industry, may have had information concerning several runaways. Authorities learned that Sprinkle was involved in the pornography industry, and they scanned several of her films in an attempt to locate Laureen. No evidence linking Sprinkle to Laureen's disappearance was discovered and she has never been implicated in her case.

An investigator visited California on Judith's behalf in 1986 and located the two motels involved in the October 1980 phone calls. Authorities said that one of the establishments may have been used by a child pornographer named ""Dr. Z."" Investigators were unable to link ""Dr. Z"" to the teen hotline and it is not known if child sexual abuse images were involved in Laureen's disappearance.

Roger Maurais, Laureen's childhood friend in Manchester, received a call from a woman identifying herself as ""Laurie"" or ""Laureen"" in 1986. Maurais's mother answered the call and said that the person claimed to be her son's former girlfriend. The caller's identity remains unknown.

One of Laureen's family members reported seeing a girl matching her description in a Boston, Massachusetts bus terminal in 1981. For about a year after Laureen disappeared, her mother frequently got mysterious phone calls. They always came at approximately 3:45 a.m. and the caller would never say anything.

Judith continued to receive phone calls around the Christmas holidays for several years from an unknown individual. She said that the person listened silently when Laureen's sister answered the phone, then terminated the call shortly afterwards. The calls stopped after Judith changed her phone number several years after Laureen vanished.

A witness reported that a prostitute in Anchorage, Alaska matched Laureen's description. The unconfirmed sighting occurred in 1988 and authorities said that the witness based his recollections on her 1980 photo. The woman was not believed to have been Laureen as a result of the time lapse.

The boy who was drinking alcohol with Laureen on the night of her disappearance committed suicide in 1985. He was never considered a suspect in her case.

Judith moved to Florida during the years after Laureen's disappearance and remarried. She believes that her daughter placed the three California phone calls in October 1980.

Laureen enjoyed singing and dancing at the time of her disappearance and dreamed of becoming an actress. Judith believes she is still alive and some of Laureen's acquaintances may know more about her disappearance than they disclosed in 1980. Investigators continue to suspect that foul play was involved in her case, which remains unsolved.

Denise Daneault, a 25-year-old woman who lived just two blocks from Laureen, disappeared six weeks after Laureen did and was never found. She and Laureen reportedly closely resembled each other in spite of the difference in their ages, but it has never been shown that their disappearances were linked.

Some agencies may list April 27, 1980 as the date of Laureen's disappearance.

Twenty-one years ago in 2000, Erin Foster (18) and Jeremy Bechtel (17) were last seen in Erin's 1998 black Pontiac Grand Am. It was 10 PM on April 3rd in White County, Tennesse and they were leaving a party. It was the last anyone ever saw either of them.

Over the years there were many rumors and false leads about the two. There were several reported sightings that lead police on a wild goose chase as far as Pensacola, Florida. There were even stories that they'd been murdered and their bodies dumped in an abandoned well, never to be found.

Unfortunately, it appears that they lost control of their vehicle going around a bend in the road and ended up submerged in the Calfkiller River. Five days ago on December 2nd, the car was found in the river by certified diver and US Navy veteran, Jeremy Sides, who runs the YouTube Channel [Exploring With Nug](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHubEgFJZQahvKeT1vMeng).",UnresolvedMysteries,[Solved] Vehicle with remains of missing teens Erin Foster and Jeremy Bechtel found in Calfkiller River,0

[Charline Rosemond ](https://uncovered.com/cases/charline-rosemond)was a fun and active,  23 year old, who lived in Everett, Massachusetts with her family. Charline worked for a Toyota dealership for nearly two year before her death—and was known for her dedication to her job. She took an interest in cosmetology and was looking forward to being an aunt soon.

**The day Charline went missing.** Charline last spoke with her family on the morning of April 6th, 2009. Charline was borrowing her father’s car, since she was having car troubles and hoping to purchase another new one. Charline and her mother discussed returning the car home later that night as her father needed it that evening. Charline obliged,[ as she had recently saved up $4,000 to purchase a Lexus](https://uncovered.com/cases/charline-rosemond/timeline) from a friend who said they would help her get a car at a discounted rate. Later that same day, Charline had plans to look at the car—with cash in hand. She told her mother she’d be home later that night after looking at the car.

However, that evening, Charline never returned home. The following morning, Charline’s parents asked Charline’s sister, Roserlie if she spoke to Charline since she did not come home. Regardless, it was very out of character for Charline to not return the car to her parents like she promised which was a reason for concern. Roserlie called Charline’s phone only to get her voicemail, before calling Charline’s friends to see if any of them knew where her sister was, only to find that none of them were with Charline. Roserlie called Charline’s job because she knew that her sister took a lot of pride in her job, and assumed she would be clocking into her 7am shift. However, there was no sign of Charline. 

By 11am on April 7th, Roserlie and her father decide to go to the Somerville Police police station to report Charline missing. At first, law enforcement dismissed the urgency of Charline’s disappearance telling the family to wait 48 hours before filing a report. This did not sit well with Roserlie, who at eight months pregnant decided to drive around to the spots she knew her sister would frequent. [She spoke to two different friends of Charline who, according to her, both seemed to have very little interest in Charline’s disappearance](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/black-girl-gone-a-true-crime-p-1628420/episodes/unsolved-the-murder-of-charlin-95047785). On April 8th, an official missing persons report was filed.

**When she was discovered.** On April 13th–six days after Charline went missing—Roserlie got a call from a friend telling her to speak to the Somerville Police department.  At the same time, a relative of Roserlie’s father called and spoke to Roserlie’s brother-in-law. When the call ended, Roserlie’s brother-in-law had to inform the family that police had found Charline’s body. [She was discovered in her father’s 2001 grey Honda Civic in an alley near the Mid Night Convenience store with a bullet wound to the head. ](http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/15/missing_everett_woman_23_found_dead_in_somerville/)Law enforcement believe that two assailants were involved; one who entered on the passenger seat and the shooter who was in the back seat of the car. Charline’s family believe she was killed because of the $4,000 cash she had on her at the time to purchase her new car, as the money was never recovered from the scene. 

**Where the case stands today.** In 2019, a suspect was arrested under two counts of perjury in relation to Charine’s case for providing false information. This individual was arraigned on $100,000 bail. However, there has been no further movement in the case, and now, it has been over 11 years since Charline was killed and Roserlie and her family are still actively seeking justice for Charline.

I know its been covered ad nauseum, but I did a write-up for [my newsletter](https://fromthemessengerbag.substack.com/about?sort=about) where I analyze the evidence and try to pick what I think happened. 

My newsletter is free, always will be, and to prove it, I'm uploading the full post here. Enjoy! 

...

Imagine this. It's the 24th of July, 1989. You're sweating in the  shade of a birch tree near Mt. Asahidake in Hokkaido, Japan.  You've been lost for a few days now, and you're starting to feel  delirious.  You look over at your friend,  and he smiles back at you  reassuringly. 

""They have to have a team out already. Someone will find us."" He almost sounds like he believes it. 

Suddenly,  you become aware of the deafening sound of helicopter rotors overhead.  You've never heard such a sweet sound in your life. You run out into the  clearing, waving your hands. Your friend is shouting up at them as  well, trying to get their attention. 

They see you and begin to  descend slowly onto a flat part of the mountainside. You realize you're  crying tears of joy as you run to the clearing, pushing your exhausted  muscles to their spent limit. 

A rescuer embraces you tightly after they've landed. He begins talking to you, his voice a friendly and pleasing baritone. 

""Don't worry. You're safe now. We'll take you back to your families and homes.""

It's music to your ears. Then he says something else. 

""It's a good thing you two made that SOS sign nearby or we might have never known where to look.""

You  look at your friend who breaks off a drink of water to return the eye  contact. You both exchange a look of confusion before you turn to the  rescuer and say, ""What SOS sign?""

...

In the summer of 1989, a Japanese search crew found a giant SOS sign  made from birch trees that had been cut down and laid to make the  letters. Spotting the sign enabled the rescue team to find the man and  his friend after they'd gone missing. But after establishing the man and  his friend didn't make the sign, Japanese authorities were puzzled. Who  made this sign, and why? And were they ever saved? 

In the days following the rescue, the authorities made several puzzling discoveries. 

Investigating  the sign itself, they looked at aerial photographs the Japanese  Forestry Service takes every five years of the area, and saw a  reflection on a photo that the sign existed in 1987. The same reflection  could not be seen on the photo taken in 1982. Close to the sign, police  found a full human skeleton with gnaw marks on some of the bones,  indicating some scavenging had occurred. The skeleton had fractures in  its right shoulder, and left thigh. The coroner concluded that these  were present when the person was alive, and upon further examination,  the conclusion was made that the bones belonged to a woman, with a blood  type of O. 

In the vicinity of the body, police found a backpack  containing three cassette tapes, a Sony tape recorder, some basic  hygiene implements, and one ID card issued to a man named **Kenji Iwamura.** 

These  two findings seem to contradict one another. The bones belonging to a  woman, and the backpack being found near the body implying it belonged  to the deceased containing the ID card of a man. It gets more odd. 

The  first two cassette tapes were anime soundtracks, and the last was a  recording of a man calling for help. The message, according to [barelysociable's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/snWvNkJCCs8), is translated as such: 

""I can't move on the cliff, SOS help me.

I can't move on the cliff, SOS help me. 

The place is where I first met the helicopter.

I can't go up deeply Sasa.

Lift me from here."" 

You  would be forgiven if the translation confused you, because it isn't  great. The obvious questions are going to surround the line ""I can't go  up deeply Sasa"" so let's answer those from the jump. Sasa is a type of  dense, running bamboo that grows around Mt. Asahidake, the setting for  our mystery. The translation seems to imply that because of the Sasa  growth in the area, the person on the tape is unable to move up the  cliff to higher ground. 

The next line I want to examine is ""The  place is where I first met the helicopter."" In this line, the recorder  is telling us that he saw a helicopter, perhaps tried to get it's  attention, and then it flew off before he could be rescued. 

While  it seems odd to have taped this recording, it's been pointed out and  noted that doing so would have allowed the recorder to be able to play  it repeatedly for hours while conserving their own strength for other  endeavors. 

When Japanese authorities presented their findings  (the backpack, the recorder, and the ID card) to Mr. Iwamura's parents,  the parents were able to confirm that the backpack, as well as the  contents, belonged to their son. They were not able to confirm, however,  that it was their son on the tape recording. 

Upon discovering  the contents of the backpack, the police re-evaluated their conclusion  of to whom the bones belonged. This closer look revealed that the bones  actually belonged to a man, with a blood type of A. Which would seem to  indicate the bones belonged to Kenji Iwamura. 

Mr. Kenji Iwamura  was an office worker who went missing on a hike near Mt. Asahidake in  1984. Along the trail he was hiking, there are two rocks that serve as  landmarks. The first is called the Fake Safe Rock, because it looks like  the actual landmark, but if you depart the trail here you end up along  the ridgeline where we found our first two hikers, and subsequently, Mr.  Iwamura's final resting place. The second landmark is the ""Safe Rock""  which is the actual landmark that marks the impending end of the trail. 

Japanese  authorities did search for Iwamura after he failed to show up for work a  week later, and were unable to locate him or his remains in that  search. 

Finally, the coroner's report indicated that Mr. Iwamura  would have had his fractured shoulder and thigh while he was alive. On  top of that, the authorities stated that Mr. Iwamura's frame would have  been ""totally spent"" after laying just eight logs for the sign. I  haven't seen a number exactly, but the sign itself seems to be made of  much more than just eight logs. **On top of that,** there was no axe or hatchet found with Mr. Iwamura's things. So how did the trees get cut down? 

Now that we have our facts, let's look at our theories. 

**#1. Kenji Iwamura made the sign.** 

Each  of the facts seem to indicate that Mr. Iwamura couldn't have made the  sign, right? He had broken bones, was too small, and had no woodcutting  implements. And yet, this is still the theory I'm arguing for, why? 

Let's  start with the woodcutting implements. Mr. Iwamura's body went  undiscovered for five years before it was found, it's not impossible to  think a small hatchet is still laying in wait, waiting to be found. Or  that it was found already and picked up by some unsuspecting hiker.  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 

The coroner  report I mentioned earlier said that Mr. Iwamura would have been too  weak to lay the number of logs necessary to make the SOS sign. Maybe in a  day. But Mr. Iwamura was gone **a week** before he was  reported missing and people started looking for him. If he lays 9 logs a  day over 6 days, that's 54 logs. Not easily doable, but it doesn't seem  so far fetched now. 

Lastly, the bone fractures occurred while he  was alive, but that doesn't mean necessarily they happened immediately.  Mr. Iwamura could have been hurt by a falling tree (logging is an  extremely dangerous industry) towards the end of his log-laying  endeavor. His backpack was found in a hole under some tree roots, which  could have operated as a resting area for Mr. Iwamura while he waited to  be rescued. 

*But, what about the tape that his parents couldn't say was him or not?*

Mr.  Iwamura's parents might not have been able to identify their son's  voice, but how often would they have heard him yell? The recording,  which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/-smTubVC4ec)  (warning: eerie), has a man repeatedly shouting very slow, very clear  instructions. He breathes before almost every syllable. By all accounts,  Mr. Iwamura was friendly but not gregarious or overly expressive, so  the likelihood that someone ever heard him yell before that tape is  minimal, and it had been five years since his parents had even heard his  voice. Their memory of it might not have been extremely crisp. The  recording was found in a bag with all of Iwamura's things, so it seems  more likely its him on the recording, and he would play it on loop while  he worked to cut down trees all day. 

Finally, the timeline fits.  The aerial photo taken in 1982 didn't have the SOS sign on it because  Mr. Iwamura wouldn't go missing for another two years. It shows up in  the 1987 photo because Mr. Iwamura made it in 1984 shortly after he went  missing. 

**#2. It's a hoax.** 

There are a  few holes in almost any theory that's presented. So it occurred to me  while researching this case that things aren't adding up because they  aren't supposed to. Mr. Iwamura wasn't physically capable of making the  sign, so he didn't. There wasn't a chopping tool found because none was  left behind. Kenji Iwamura's parents couldn't identify the man on the  tape because it wasn't their son. 

Short of just throwing  circumstantial evidence at the wall, specifically regarding ""this is  what's possible"", there is no real clean summation of this case if Mr.  Iwamura wasn't the sign's creator. 

So maybe it was a hoax. Some elaborate prank made by someone with a sick sense of humor. 

But then how could Mr. Iwamura's body and belongings end up so close by pure coincidence? 

Too many holes in this theory to be seriously viable. 

**#3. ALIENS**

No, I'm just kidding, blaming the whole thing on aliens is too low effort. 

In  summation, Mr. Iwamura may have been unable to save himself, but his  hard work endured long after his body didn't. And subsequently, that  work saved two people's lives a half decade later.  So while the  evidence doesn't fully support the sign's creator being Kenji Iwamura,  it definitely doesn't support it being anyone else either.

The case is neatly summed up in this newspaper article from eight years ago. Cursory googling does not seem to reveal any new developments. Can we do better?

From the Guardian 

The University of Texas at Austin is missing about 100 brains — about half of the specimens the university had in a collection preserved in jars of formaldehyde.

One of the missing brains is believed to have come from clock tower sniper Charles Whitman.

“We think somebody may have taken the brains but we don’t know at all for sure,” psychology Professor Tim Schallert, co-curator of the collection, told the Austin American-Statesman.

His co-curator, psychology Professor Lawrence Cormack, said: “It’s entirely possible word got around among undergraduates and people started swiping them for living rooms or Halloween pranks.”

The Austin State Hospital had transferred the brains to the university about 28 years ago under a “temporary possession” agreement. Schallert said his psychology lab had room for only 100 brains, so the rest were moved to the basement of the university’s Animal Resources Center.

“They are no longer in the basement,” Cormack said.

The university said in a statement that it would investigate “the circumstances surrounding this collection since it came here nearly 30 years ago” and that it was “committed to treating the brain specimens with respect”. It says the remaining brain specimens on campus are used “as a teaching tool and carefully curated by faculty”.

The university’s agreement with the hospital required the school to remove any data that might identify the person from whom the brain came. However Schallert said Whitman’s brain likely was part of the collection.

“It would make sense it would be in this group. We can’t find that brain,” he said.

Whitman’s 1966 rampage, which culminated at the University of Texas, killed 16 people, including his mother and wife. Eleven of the victims were fatally shot by Whitman who had barricaded himself on the observation deck of the University of Texas Tower before he was killed by police.

The 100 remaining brains at the school had been moved to the Norman Hackerman Building, where they were being scanned with high-resolution resonance imaging equipment, Cormack said.

“These MRI images will be both useful teaching and research tools. It keeps the brains intact,” he told the newspaper.

Story continues  from New York Times Dec 2014

There were some reports the brains had been found. Early Tuesday afternoon, there were reports that the missing brains had turned up at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. These have since been discounted.

“We have no evidence that any brain specimens were shared with other universities or health institutions,” the statement said, adding that there was also no evidence that one of the brains destroyed came from Charles Whitman, the tower sniper whose 1966 rampage terrorized the campus and killed 16.

According to the statement, the university will investigate why some of the specimens were disposed of and how all of them had been handled since the university received the collection.

Last year in Indianapolis, David Charles, 21, was charged with stealing 60 human brains from the Indiana Medical History Museum. The police were tipped off by Brian Kubasco of San Diego, who had bought six of the brains on eBay for $600, and suspected they were stolen. About 48 of the brains were returned to the museum, which is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital. All of the brains were from the autopsies of mental patients over roughly a half-century through the 1940s.

“These brain collections go back to the mid-1800s, and it’s not uncommon for their whereabouts to be unclear,” said Brian Burrell, a University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor and author of “Postcards From the Brain Museum: The Improbable Search for Meaning in the Matter of Famous Minds.”

Disposing of such a collection can be awkward, he said, since it may not be possible to give away the brains. Sometimes, he said, an institution does not even know it has them.

EBay policy prohibits the sale of human remains, with the exception of hair and skulls, as well as skeletons sold for medical use. But enforcement is not air tight, as evidenced by the Indiana case.

While a federal law protecting the burial sites of Native Americans prohibits trade in Indian funeral objects and human remains, it is generally left to the states to regulate the trade of remains.

Some extensive collections of brains have simply vanished.

“There was one collection of 600 brains, by a Philadelphia anatomist, and no one knows where they are,” Mr. Burrell said.",UnresolvedMysteries,A cold case that for once does not involve a terrible murder... **100 ABNORMAL BRAINS DISAPPEAR IN TEXAS!!**,0

A couple of them that I've found in my deep dives include:

**1. Maria Bögerl**

Maria Bögerl was the wife of Thomas Bögerl, the head of a Sparkasse (savings bank) in southwestern Germany. On the morning of 12 May 2010, she was kidnapped by person(s) unknown from her family house in Heidenheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. The kidnapper then called Thomas later that day and demanded a ransom of €300,000 (just under $340,000 in 2021) for her release. Thomas complied, and the money was placed in a rucksack and placed under an underpass next to the Autobahn, its location marked with a German flag. The kidnapper(s) never showed up and cut all contacts with both Thomas and the authorities. The Bögerl family (Thomas, his son, and daughter) made a tearful plea for Maria's return in the German crime show ""Aktenzeichen XY"" (whose format was actually the basis for Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted). Unfortunately, Maria's remains were found by a hiker in a wooded area about 10 km north of Heidenheim on 3 June 2010. An autopsy showed that Maria had most likely died the day she was abducted. Thomas committed suicide less than a year later. As of 2020, police have pursued more than 10,000 leads, and although they have DNA evidence, the case is still unsolved.

She had returned with her friends from a trip to Slagelse, around 20 km northwest of Korsør. She never made it home. A massive search was launched to find her, to no avail.

Toh Hong Huat and Keh Chin Ann were two 12-year-old boys who vanished without a trace from their school in Singapore on 14 May 1986. Hong Huat was last seen as he left for school, while Chin Ann was last seen at around 12:30 pm during the school break. A search was immediately launched to find the boys. Thousands of missing person posters were spread around the island city-state. McDonald's offered a reward of SGD 100,000 (just over $73,000 in 2021) for any information leading to the discovery of the boys, leading to the name of the case. Despite the large reward and the intense search effort, neither one of the boys have ever been found, and they have been declared legally dead in the years after. Theories ranged from the boys running away, being taken by Hong Huat's estranged father, to them being trafficked to Thailand and forced to beg on the streets, with their limbs cut off.

Rosemont, Montreal, Qc, Canada

&amp;#x200B;

Catherine Daviau was a 26 years old woman living alone in her apartment  at ***5165 5th Avenue*** in the Rosemont neighbourhood of Montreal. On the evening of December 11th, she came home from work at around 6 pm and was seen entering her apartment by neighbours around that time. She also talked to a friend on her cellphone at around that time, which shows that Catherine had originally safely reached her home.

However, about only an hour later at around 7:07 PM, a neighbour would call 911 to report a fire at her apartment. 

When the firefighters arrived at the location, they found that the doors were locked and there wasn't any sign of someone breaking into the apartment. They busted the door down and that's when they found Catherine's body on her bed.

Catherine was nude, had visible marks of violence and had been tied up. Her agressor had beaten her up and raped her before setting her room on fire and leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Evidence

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbour's quick call to 911 had resulted in a decent amount of evidence being preserved. The evidence collected by investigators informed them of a few facts.

1- Catherine's attacker had planned ahead. he had brought tie-wraps and bags with him to restrain Catherine. Which shows that the whole thing was planned and not a random act of violence.

2- The attacker was a smoker and smoked Players filter cigarettes, since a few botched up cigarettes had been left behind and Catherine herself was not a smoker.

3- Setting the place on fire however might have been a last minute decision since the ""accelerant"" used to light the fire was a bottle of Catherine's perfume.

DNA was collected at the crime scene but no match was found in any database. 

&amp;#x200B;

# The investigation

&amp;#x200B;

The investigators deduce that Catherine's killer might have stalked her for a while before the attack and learned of her usual schedule because of the very short time frame between her arrival home and the time by which the fire had been discovered by the neighbour. Which means the time between her arrival home and being attacked was even shorter.

While police wouldn't officially state the exact cause of death, the publicly available coroner report shows that the cause of death was from being repeatedly stabbed in the throat and stomach.

Catherine's family find it hard to understand that nobody would have heard her being attacked considering the type of building she lived in (a typical Rosemont triplex surrounded by entire blocks of similar buildings), circumstances that can remind a lot of people about the Diane Bélanger case of 1982 where a young woman had been apparently abducted from her bedroom without anybody in the apartment or adjacent units noticing.

Unfortunately, the case has gone cold since 2008, with no matches being made in any known DNA database. The investigators are considering eventually turning to DNA genealogy testing to revive the case but haven't done so yet.

DNA phenotyping has been done but the police are hesitant to release the information to the public since all it would give is a very generic idea of what the suspect could look like and wouldn't give the age or any specific bodily detail that would make the suspect recognizable. They're also afraid that it might lead to a ton of false leads.

12 year old Rhianna Barreau disappeared from her home in Wakefield Avenue, Morphett Vale, South Australia on October 7, 1992.

Rhianna shared the home with her mother Paula and brother Shannon. Although Rhianna's parents were no longer together, she remained close to both of them. 
Rhianna's dad Leon, was living on the Gold Coast, Queensland, at the time with his wife Sandra. It was the summer school holidays and while Rhianna usually spent her break with her dad up north, this time she had chosen to stay home with her mum. Her brother Shannon was away on school camp. 

That morning at approximately 8.30am, her mother Paula was about to leave the family home and go to work. 

Rhianna was planning to catch the bus to meet her mother that day at the Colonnades shopping centre, which was approximately 6 kilometres from her home to buy a Christmas card for her American pen pal. 

Paula had heard on the radio that there was going to be a bus strike that day, and went into Rhianna's room to discuss the change of plans. She entered her  bedroom where Rhianna was listening to music. Paula suggested that because of the bus strike maybe she could walk to the Reynella shopping centre instead. This shopping centre was only approximately 1.5 kilometres and around a 20 minute walk away from her house. Paula then gave her daughter a kiss goodbye, and unfortunately this was the last time she ever saw her. 

It is thought that Rhianna remained at her home until approximately 10.30am, when she was seen leaving walking in the directions of the shops. Sources claim that Rhianna bought the card for her pen pal from the news agents at 11.19am.

Rhianna was then sighted again between 12.05pm and 12.30pm walking through the grounds of Morphett Vale High School, carrying a small bag thought that contained the card. Some sources claim this was the last sighting of Rhianna, though I also read a number of articles that stated there was another sighting of her at 4.00pm standing alone at the junction of David Terrace and Acre Avenue which is approximately a 6 minute walk from her home on Wakefield avenue. 

At approximately 4.10pm Paula Barreau returned to her family home to find the door locked. When she entered the house she was met with a record lying on the floor, and the tv still on. On the dinning room table was a card that Rhianna had bought for her pen pal, still there in its plastic wrapper. While Rhianna's personal belongings where still in the house, there was no sign of her daughter. 

Paula searched inside and outside, and knocked on the door of her neighbours houses but there was no sign of Rhianna. Although Paula had hope that maybe she accidently overstayed at a friend's house, she knew deep down this was unlikely. And by 6pm the police where contacted. 

Two days later Mr Allen Arthur was called in to lead the investigation.

""From the time I went through the preliminary statements gathered by the two detectives from Major Crime and read all the additional information that was being gathered, I knew something was wrong, I knew she was in trouble,"" he said.

""At the time we established that she'd been seen at the shopping centre … that she was seen walking through the Morphett Vale school and we can only assume that she was on her way home with the cards from the shop. After that there is very, very little.""

Since this day there have been some potential leads, that have been released to the public but unfortunately haven't lead to an arrest. Many people mention a white 2 door Holden Torana with Victorian licence plates that had been seen circling the area days before Rhianna disappeared. 

One neighbour of Rhianna's has stated that her husband saw a white torana, parked in the street on and off in the days prior to the abduction, but he hasn't seen it since. 

Police thought they had a breakthrough and went public with a sighting of the white Torana, however the sightings of the Torana led police nowhere.

Several women have reported to being followed by the same 2 door torana in that area. Police have asked for the driver of this torana to come forward for many many years, but at this point nobody ever has. 

""I have some doubts whether it was a white Torana and with Victorian number plates, only because we hadn't found it and we spent a lot of time looking at white Toranas,"" Mr Arthur said.

Another neighbour of Rhianna's also reported hearing a young girl screaming on the afternoon of the disappearance, but was unknown if this was related to the case. Searches for Rhianna at the time where widespread and thorough, and unfortunately nothing has been found to lead to any arrest. Police believe due to Rhianna's age and lack of contact from her for nearly 30 years they can assume Rhianna is no longer alive. They believe she was likely murdered not long after she was abducted. 

Police are offering immunity and a $1 million dollar reward for information and leads to the arrest of the disaperance or murder of Rhianna.

764,Due-Faithlessness,1638749959,"This case is incredibly mysterious, with almost no details available from most sources. Branton's family has apparently made few efforts to publicize his disappearance. However, one person has put significant effort into compiling information about Branton - a high school classmate of his.

Branton was born on July 17, 1960. His father was a pediatrician, and his family was socially prominent. He graduated from Allen High School in Allentown, PA. Allentown is  a small city located in eastern PA, about an hour's drive from Philadelphia. In high school he was a good student who was involved in many extracurricular activities, including serving as class president and competing in swimming and golf. Branton's high school classmate remembers him as possessed of a biting, sarcastic wit. He also recalls that Branton frequently expressed homophobic attitudes towards men he perceived to be gay. 

Branton graduated from Lehigh University with a Bachelor's in American Studies, and attended law school at Temple University. He appears to have been admitted to the bar around 1986, when he was 26 years old. Few details are available regarding Branton's life between 1986 and his disappearance in 1993. Branton worked as a lawyer, and at the time of his disappearance worked at a law practice at 921 Hamilton St in Allentown. Sources are unclear as to which type of law he practiced, or whether the practice was a group or solo practice.

In 1985, when he was 25, Branton was the victim of a mugging and abduction at knifepoint. The perpetrators, brothers named Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, forced Branton to withdraw $175 in cash from an ATM and then drive them to a house where they purchase drugs.

Branton was quoted in a 1990 article as the Special Projects Coordinator for the Lehigh Valley Red Cross AIDS Service Center, saying that he'd surveyed volunteers with the program and found that they primarily chose to volunteer because it made them feel good. ""You're doing the right thing,"" he told the volunteers. ""Your work is really appreciated.""

Branton had a problem with substance abuse. According to his roommate, it wasn't unusual for Branton to disappear for as long as a week, only to reappear. His sister said that his family often didn't hear from him for months.

At the time of his disappearance, Branton was living with a roommate on the 20 block of N 16th St in Allentown.  He was last seen leaving the Allentown Racquetball Club at Sixth and Union Streets in Allentown, Pennsylvania at approximately 11:00 a.m. on January 7, 1993. When his roommate returned to their apartment that evening, he noticed Branton's car parked across the street, instead of in its usual place behind the building. All of Branton's possessions, including his medicine and clothes, were inside the apartment, but there was no sign of him. His roommate waited several days to report him missing, since Branton had disappeared before. 

Branton's family apparently initially believed that he had vanished of his own accord. A news article states, ""Lancaster \[Branton's sister\] was hesitant to discuss her brother's disappearance or the family's experience since then. She said she and her relatives were skeptical that publicity could do little more than rekindle the pain they've tried to overcome.""

At the time of his disappearance, Branton was 5'10"" and 170 lbs with light brown hair. 

Could Branton's disappearance be related to his drug problem? To homophobia? Was his disappearance related to an AIDS infection, perhaps due to cognitive symptoms of the disease? We may never know.

766,AckReik03,1638740959,"# The I-70 Killer

The I-70 killer is an unidentified American serial killer who is known to have killed six store clerks in the Midwest in the spring of 1992. His nickname derives from the fact that several of the stores in which his victims worked were located a few miles off of Interstate 70 (I-70).

His victims were usually young, petite, brunette women. One of the victims was a man, but it is believed that he was mistaken for a woman by the killer as he often wore a ponytail. All of the stores attacked were speciality stores and were usually only robbed of a few hundred dollars. He is also suspected of shooting three more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived.

Despite the case being featured on Unsolved Mysteries and Dark Minds, the killer is yet to be identified and investigators have not publicly identified any suspects.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-70\_Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-70_Killer)

# The Murder of Billy Brossman

On November 30, 2001, at approximately 6:30pm, an unidentified man entered the 7th and 70 Liquor Store located at 2701 Prairieton Road, Terre Haute, Indiana, where he robbed, then shot and killed the store clerk, 31-year-old Billy Brossman, with a 38. caliber handgun, without any known motive, while the whole incident was caught on surveillance camera.

Police describe the suspect as a white man about 5'8 to 6'0, medium build with thinning hair, between 30-40 years old. Several photos of the suspect were recovered from the store video, and have been distributed since the homicide more than 20 years ago.

The shooting occurred just seven blocks from the murder of Michael McCown during the 1992 serial-murder-spree. The investigation received national attention when it was featured on the show America's Most Wanted.

In 2021, multiple sources close to the investigation told News 4 they were closely looking at a convenience store homicide in Terre Haute in 2001, Terre Haute police sergeant Troy Davis confirmed to News 4 there are similarities between the 2001 murder, and the I-70 serial murders.

Davis said investigators have identified a person of interest in the 2001 case. That person is not in custody. Investigators emphasize they are looking at each case separately before drawing any conclusions at this point.

Investigators are cautious to publicly make any connection between the cases at this point. But another police source told News 4 he is confident the person who killed Brossman is definitely a suspect as the I-70 serial killer.

Police have long speculated as to why, after killing six people in one month in 1992, the killer suddenly stopped. If the Brossman case can be connected, then he clearly did not.

**The murder of Bernie Williams, Gisborne, Australia, 1984.**

Bernie Williams was executed with two shots from a pistol to the head on March 3, 1984, near Gisborne, Victoria, Australia. He had been walked 20 metres off Hobbs Road, in Bullengarook, into a scrubby patch of bush with his hands tied behind his back. Reports indicated there was evidence he knew what was coming, but I haven’t found a report as to what that evidence is. His body showed no other injuries and so police believe he was killed by a professional hitman. His body was found hunched over by a trail bike rider, five days after he disappeared. 

Williams was the doting father of a three-year-old daughter.  He was married to the girl's mother, but they were separated and remained on good terms.

It may be that Bernie had a premonition something was going to happen to him, telling his mother several weeks before he disappeared that he was “in big trouble”. Asking if she could help he told his mother:  ""No … it's something I have to do for myself.""

Bernie was a champion footballer and well-known around his home town of Melton. Melton at the time was a small country town and football was one of the hubs of social life. The other thing that Bernie had a reputation for was having affairs with various women, some of whom were the wives and girlfriends of other men.

This meant that police had several suspects when Williams' body was discovered murdered in the bush. 

Four days after his disappearance, a phone call to a police station north of Melbourne was received claiming the be Williams and that he was one a “binge” and camped just outside Adelaide, South Australia . He would be back in two weeks. A junior constable initially took the call, hearing the initial STD beeps indicating the call had come from interstate. He then handed the phone to Officer B. Officer B claimed to investigators that it was Bernie Williams on the call as he knew him well. However at the time of the call Bernie Williams was already dead, the state of his body suggesting he had died within hours of going missing.

Based on this sexual jealousy theory, detectives theorised that ""The way he died is consistent with somebody having paid a hit man to do the job,"" Homicide Squad Detective Sergeant Bob Snell told the media in 1985. ""An irate husband would probably want to make sure he suffered before being killed.  Mr Williams had not been touched.  His only injuries were caused by the two shots.""

In June, 1985, a coroner delivered an open finding, saying there appeared to be no motive for killing Williams. Police found Mr Williams had no known enemies or involvement in drugs.

Now, cold-case police are looking again at sexual jealousy as a possible motive. There are several suspects, but one of whom is the now retired Officer B.  It is suspected Williams was having an affair with Office B’s wife and may have even been discovered in the family home.

Williams was a man who made no secret of his sexual exploits, according to evidence given to police by an apprentice plumber who worked with him.

""He would brag to me of his sexual habits with other women and he would tell me the next day what he had done with the girl, and sometimes who it was,"" the apprentice said. ""Some days he would go off leaving me on the work site and he \[came\] back an hour or so later and tell me he'd just screwed some girl”. ""During the time I knew him he told me of dozens of girls he had sex with, after a while I used to get sick of it and didn't listen to him.""

Bernie Williams drove a dark blue Ford LTD, and several locals gave evidence about seeing him in a carpark the night before he was reported missing. The carpark was about halfway between his house and his parent's house, where he had just finished his last meal.

One witness told police about a man he saw talking to Williams in the car park, and how it was unusual the man had greeted Williams as Bernard, not Bernie. ""I know Bernie Williams by sight and I have seen him round town,"" he said. ""I am familiar with his car, the LTD. I knew it was Bernie's car as soon as I saw it.""

There is not much more information online about the murder of Bernie Williams and it doesn’t rate much mention when cold cases are raised in Victoria.

When Gloria's blood was removed there were beige or tan particles/crystals/flakes in her blood. One of the staff members who was infected, Dr. Gorchynski, also had the same particles in her blood when she was examined at another hospital. Her symptoms included trouble breathing, double vision, full body tremors that were notably painful. Another nurse claimed to experience having trouble with her hearing and aphasia. I forget her name, but I don't think it's known if the same thing was found in her blood. The blood samples revealed that there was a reduced amount of cholinesterase in the blood. That is something that happens when someone is exposed to pesticides. If you look at the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning, it does kinda line up with the symptoms presented. But not 100%. The things that stood out to me were the double vision explained by Doctor Gorchynski, and the other nurse's symptoms. Everybody's different and does react to things in their own way tho, so having some uncommon side effects isn't too crazy of a theory. So, let me wrap this up. My theory is that Gloria had been exposed to Parathion methyl, also known as O,O-Dimethyl O-4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate. Either that or somehow a chemical reaction in her body was quite literally producing it or something very similar to it. Parathion methyl can cause heart problems, kidney failure, and SWEAT. When exposed to your skin, Parathion methyl can sleep through into your blood stream. She could have been all sweaty and covered in pesticides, causing a garlicy, smell. The renal failure could cause the ammonia smell. I'm not sure how long the chemical is traceable. They could have very well not detected anything after the toxic exposure happened if it had a short halflife. Also, there could have been a huge cover up as to how she got poisoned in the first place, so they tried to make people believe it was mass hysteria, and when that wasnt accepted, they had to make up this crazy DMSO to Dimethyl sulfate. I do believe that the hospital may have had a gas leak of Parathion, or Gloria got exposed to so much that it was toxic to everyone around her. Parathion Methyl would be become a banned substance just 3 years and 11 months after the tragic events that occured the day that Gloria Ramirez died. I even think she may have attempted suicide after finding out she had cancer 6 months prior to her death.

774,TaraCalicosBike,1638638240,"Hello all! I wanted to discuss my/our thoughts on the trial transcript of Lizzie Borden, at the trial of the murders of her father &amp; step mother. 

[Wikipedia on Case](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Borden)


I’ve had my own opinions on this case, and after reading the trial transcript, they’ve begun to shift.

[Trial Transcript of Lizzie’s Testimony](https://famous-trials.com/lizzieborden/1444-inquest)

Now, I get the witnesses can be unreliable, or get their statements twisted… but Lizzie seems to be doing a lot of misstepping, backtracking, and holds a lot of confusion around her own statements. 

For example, she claims she went to the barn to find lead sinkers for her upcoming fishing trip. She goes on to say that the farm she plans to fish at and holds her equipment already gas lines, rods, and… sinkers. The lawyer proceeds to question her on why she would need a sinker if they’re already there. She seems thrown off by this, and goes on to say that she doesn’t know if sinkers are at the farm, and she wanted to search the barn, upstairs, for them… so she doesn’t need to buy any if she already has them. This seems fair enough. But, her trip isn’t until the following Monday, and she happens to be in the stifling hot barn exactly the time of the murder of her father, on Thursday prior. Does Lizzie need 20 minutes in the barn searching a small box for sinkers? The lawyer is stuck on this point. She claims she spent some of that time eating pears. The lawyer wants to know why are you eating pears when you were too sick for breakfast? She backtracks a lot here, regarding whether she at breakfast. 

She backtracks about her Wednesday evening dinner, and whether she was even there for that. This is important, because if she was, she would have encountered Uncle John Morse. 

Another small but sticky point for me: she stumbles over what she was doing in the kitchen. She claims to be reading Harpers Magazine, waiting for her iron flats to heat. Later, she goes on to say it was Providence Journal. The lawyer notices the misstep, and questions which she was reading. She more or less then says both. 


But for me, this is the most important part: when asked where she was when Bridget answers the door to her father, she first claims she was at the top of the stairs. This correlates with Bridget saying she heard a small giggle, at the top of the stairs, from Lizzie. Slightly later on, Lizzie claims she wasn’t at the top of the stairs at all, but elsewhere in the house. Why does Lizzie have so many different versions of her activities that morning? 


Questions: 

1. The family was all very sick, the maid included. Lizzie was seen at the pharmacy asking to buy Prussic acid the day before. Was Lizzie’s initial plan to poison the family? Did she manage to find something to put into the food, making the family sick, and then faked her own illness? 

2. What took 20 minutes in the barn? The lawyer is right that it should have only taken a few minutes, and her eating the pears seems like an after thought answer to buy time for her being in the barn. 

3. Where was Lizzie when her father came home? It sounds like her first answer is truth,  that she was at the top of the stairs, as Bridget heard a giggle. Why did she backtrack and say she was elsewhere in the house? 

My thoughts: I think Lizzie knew and worked with the killer. They were both in on it, but she didn’t wield the axe. I also believe the uncle had knowledge. I find it no coincidence that the murder occurred on his first visit to the family in 5 years. What are your thoughts?

This was a case I recently came upon and found very little coverage here, and given recent developments thought it worthwhile to summarise the key events of the Starved Rock murders of 1960 and recent updates. Whilst Chester Weger was convicted of the crime, accusations of a forced confession, police coercion, contaminated evidence and an alleged deathbed confession have created persistent doubt as to his guilt since. Does Chester Weger have a case to test his innocence? Will new evidence testing yield new leads, or do you think they convicted the right killer?

There’s a fair bit to cover, so in order to manage the length of this piece I have covered only key details, so the below should by no means be considered comprehensive. It’s still turned out quite lengthy, so fair warning.

**Starved Rock State Park**

Starved Rock State Park became the first recreational park owned by the state of Illinois when it was purchased in 1911, but had been developed privately as a destination for vacationers in the late 19th century. Situated on the bank of the Illinois River and famed for its many canyons, visitors can enjoy 13 miles (21km) of hiking trails, with overlook views and waterfalls, as well as recreational fishing, boating and camping. Only ninety miles (150km) south-west of Chicago, Starved Rock remains the most popular state park in Illinois.

**Three friends take a trip**

Lillian Oetting, 50, Frances Murphy, 47, and Mildred Linquist, 50 all resided in the Riverside neighbourhood of Chicago. Wives of prominent businessmen, they planned a four day getaway to Starved Rock State Park and set off on Monday, 14 March 1960. After checking in to the Starved Rock Lodge, they ate lunch before heading out for a hike to St Louis Canyon, an approximately 2 mile (3km) return track with views to a spring-fed waterfall. They took Frances Murphy’s camera and set off through the snowy landscape. 

Oetting’s husband George was expecting to hear from his wife that evening – when he received no call from her, he rang the hotel. Staff told him she wasn’t available, and suggested she might call the next morning. Unconcerned, George wondered if perhaps they had gone out for the evening. He called again the next morning, and was told the three women had been at breakfast together that morning, and must have gone out. George was reassured by this, even though the sighting would prove to be mistaken.

A late winter storm hit the area later that night, with near-blizzard conditions blanketing the area with several inches of snow.

On Wednesday morning, George Oetting called the lodge again, and when he could not reach his wife for the third time, insisted staff check on their room. They discovered the beds unslept in and their bags still packed. The station wagon belonging to Murphy remained parked outside the lodge. The women had been unaccounted for at this point by almost 40 hours. Alarmed, George phoned his friend, Virgil W. Peterson, operating director of the Chicago Crime Commission. Word of the missing friends soon reached the LaSalle County Sherriff’s office, who prepared to begin the search. 

**The Discovery in St Louis Canyon**

The bodies of the three women were soon found by several boys, recruited to the search from a nearby state correctional camp. Found on their backs under a small rock ledge, two of the women were naked from the waist down, while the third was found still wearing a girdle. Two of them were bound together with white string, and all had been viciously beaten around the head. In clearing the recently fallen snow, the site was disturbed by investigators and potential evidence may have been destroyed.

Nearby they found Murphy’s camera, case smeared with blood and the strap broken; a pair of bloodied binoculars and a frozen tree limb, also covered in blood. They determined the branch was likely the murder weapon, and after studying the scene, considered it likely that the murder had taken place deeper in the canyon, and then the bodies dragged under the ledge. 

Autopsies concluded that the women had been killed shortly after lunching at the lodge, but were unable to determine if sexual assaults had taken place. Robbery was considered an unlikely motive as the women had left their valuables behind in the hotel room. Initial theories held that more than one attacker was likely involved as it would have been very difficult for a single person to overpower and control three able women.

**Few leads and mounting pressures**

With little evidence to go on, the investigation failed to make headway for months following the murders. Matters were further complicated by jurisdictional tensions between the state’s attorney and the state police; state investigators suggested that Chicago mobsters had committed the murders in an act of retribution against Crime Commissioner Virgil Peterson, a close family friend of all three women. State attorney Harland Warren doubted that gangsters would travel 100 miles to commit such a murder and not bring a weapon with them. 

Pressure from the press to solve the crime was constant and investigation costs mounted. A small gold ring belonging to Oetting which was thought missing sparked hopes of a new lead, but instead caused more scandal when it was found – overlooked inside her bloody glove.

Against these increasing pressures, Warren Harland decided to spend his own money to purchase a microscope and take a closer look at the two kinds of twine which had been wrapped around two of the victims. This led him to match both kinds of twine to that found in the Starved Rock Lodge’s kitchen, where it was used for wrapping food. All the lodge workers had already been subjected to questioning (via polygraph, an unreliable method), but Warren ordered them to be questioned again.

This is when Chester Weger came under suspicion.

**Finally, a suspect**

Chester Weger was a 21-year-old man with a wife and two young children. At the time of the murders, he was working in the Lodge’s kitchen. Weger’s failure of the subsequent polygraph test brought him under suspicion. Weger co-operated with investigators, surrendering a buckskin jacket with suspicious dark stains. Testing confirms the stain is blood, although sources differ as to whether it is confirmed to be human. By September, investigators had begun constant surveillance of Weger and attempt to connect him to a robbery and sexual assault which occurred two months before the Starved Rock murders in a nearby park, where the assailant bound the female teenage victim with twine.

After failing another series of polygraph tests, and with the victim of the earlier assault identifying Weger’s photograph as that of her attacker, Weger is arrested. He is questioned about the 1959 assault, in an interrogation that lasts beyond midnight. Weger confessed to the murders, saying he attempted to rob the women and killed them when they fought back.

Weger signed a confession typed up for him and led a re-enactment of the crime for police and reporters at St Louis Canyon. Following his first meeting with attorneys however, Weger retracted his confession, stating investigators threatened him with a gun and told him they would send him to the electric chair.

Weger maintained this retraction throughout his trial and conviction for one of the murders, that of Lillian Oetting. Prosecutors sought conviction for only one of the murders so that further trials could be pursued if a conviction was not secured for Oetting’s murder. Weger received a life sentence on March 4, 1961, despite the death penalty initially being sought.

**Doubts cast on conviction**

 Chester Weger maintained his innocence throughout his incarceration. In a letter to the Chicago Tribune on April 20, 1963, Weger wrote, “Now there’s nothing in the world that I needed bad enough to kill for.” He refused on multiple occasions to admit guilt to secure release at parole reviews.

There appears to be no physical evidence linking Chester to the crime scene and no witnesses place him at the scene of the crime. There is however physical evidence which suggests Weger could be innocent. Blonde and black hairs found on the victims, including on the finger of Frances Murphy’s glove and in the palm of Lillian Oetting, were found to be dissimilar to Weger’s hair. No hair or fibre evidence was presented at trial, despite numerous samples being collected at the scene. The presence of both black and blonde hairs on the victims strongly suggest the presence of two killers, in line with the investigators’ own initial assessment. 

Weger claimed that his initial motive for the attack was robbery, however all the victims still had their jewellery on them when found. Decades after the conviction, a juror admitted to the Chicago Tribune in 2016 that she found Weger’s confession “implausible” at the time. Weger’s current attorneys, Andy Hale and Celeste Stack, argue that a case such as this would have never made it to trial under today’s standards.

An alleged deathbed confession surfaced in 2006, in an affidavit signed by Chicago Sergeant Mark Gibson. Included in a motion to support new DNA testing, Gibson states that around 1982, he visited a woman in hospital to help her “clear her conscience.” The woman told the officer “things got out of hand” at a State Park and “they dragged the bodies.” Gibson reported that this confession was cut short by the woman’s daughter, who said her mother was not of sound mind. The affidavit did not name the woman, nor did it address whether there had been any follow-up after the initial reporting of the incident. 

The DNA testing was granted, allowing hairs found at the scene and the buckskin jacket to be tested, but failed to provide any new information as the samples were corrupted.

**Parole after almost 60 years**

Weger was denied parole 23 times over the course of his sentence. He was finally granted parole on November 21, 2019, but his release was delayed until February 21, 2020 under review against the state's Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act. At the time of his release, he was the longest-serving inmate in Illinois’ prisons.

**October 2021: A new chance to test evidence**

On October 26, 2021, new permission was granted to test evidence using contemporary techniques. This includes cigarette butts, hairs and string found at the crime scene. LaSalle County prosecutors  opposed the testing, claiming the evidence has been improperly stored, and even handled by students on field trips. It remains to be seen if this testing provides any further information, or if contamination interferes as it did in the 2006 tests.

A forthcoming HBO documentary *The Murders at Starved Rock* could be interesting viewing, as it follows investigation into Weger’s conviction by the son of the lead prosecutor in the original trial.

As I mentioned, the above is just a summary of events related to this case, but I recommend reading further in to the details of the investigation if interested as I couldn’t cover everything here. Troy Taylor’s account, available via Google books and linked below, is a great place to start.

 It was cold and raining, and he was visiting a friend in the Yakely dorms when he decided to walk back to Brody hall where he was staying the night. He texted his friend that he was lost, but then his phone died. This was the last ping that law enforcement was able to track. 

There is a giant river that wraps around campus and they think he fell in. They been searching it for 30+ days at this point, and haven’t found a single thing. They brought out multiple dive crews this week, and did an extensive search, nothing was found.

[Kevin Parle](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/most-wanted/kevin-thomas-parle) (AKA 'Hemp') is wanted for the murder of 16 year old Liam Kelly in 2004 and 22 year old Lucy Hargreaves in 2005, both in Liverpool, UK.

Liam was shot dead by Parle over a £200 debt that Liam owed to another man, Anthony Campbell. Anthony pleaded guilty in court to arranging the murder and hiring Parle and was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 20 years. [HERE](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/boy-16-shot-dead-street-20842637) is a local news article on the murder.

Lucy was asleep on her living room sofa when Parle shot her and then poured petrol around the house and set it alight. The target for the murder was Lucy's boyfriend but as he was not home, Parle killed Lucy instead. 

After being arrested for Lucy's murder and questioned, Parle was released on bail but absconded and is yet to be re-arrested.

It is believed Parle could be in Europe but there have been reports of him being seen in the [Canary Islands](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/double-murder-fugitive-confronted-british-18308304), [Dubai, Thailand](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/double-murder-fugitive-kevin-parle-17995594) and [mainland Europe](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/suspect-killer-most-wanted-list-20841924.amp).

But where is he??? 

Is a criminal underworld hiding him? Offering him freedom in return for utilising his size, sterength and intimidating appearance?

Is he hiding away and keeping to himself?

Greetings everyone!

I am here to provide a follow up to a post I did on this subreddit nearly 8 years ago about my mother. You can find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2r37i8/the_disappearance_of_my_mother_deborah_sykes/). 

Reddit loves updates so I am here to hopefully provide some insight. (I asked the mods about making this post a few months ago and was give the go ahead). 

Anyway, what sort of stuff can happen on a case like this over 8 years? Glad you asked! Basically, the case was picked up by a detective working at the department and she has worked on it while she could over the last few years. I can't provide all the details of what she's done but she put forth a valiant effort in attempt to close the book on this case. 

As of early 2021, my step dad, Del, died in his home (wasn't COVID). Any truth he had died with him, and despite all the effort, he never gave any useful information. 

As of May 2021, my grandfather has also passed (also not COVID), which pretty much wraps up this case and any hope that it would be solved unfortunately. 

The detective working the case questioned many people, and even met with Del a few times in hopes to get some information on what happened. They had a formal questioning with him about the case, but he did not confess or provide any information (side note from my original post is he did admit to killing the family dog). 

After Del passed, his belongings were searched and there was nothing that provided any insight to the case.  

I've done a couple podcasts over the years which I'll link below:

In the end, my mother has been missing for almost 17 years (damn) and I personally feel by now we'll never know the truth. If she was in hiding I had hoped the passing of her father, and the passing of Del might pull her out, but I guess not. 

Alright, sorry this post is lacking anything super interesting but I am more than happy to answer any questions I can. Obviously a lot more has happened in the 8 years it's just difficult to remember and summarize it all here.

In 1999, Brittney Simpson and her siblings would awake to what is still an unbelievable nightmare til this day: their doting mother Kitty Wyanette Simpson had not returned home since the evening before.

On the evening of February 15th, 1999, Kitty Simpson, a 27 year old mother described by most as a fashionista, went for a night out at Cool Daddy’s Bar in Oklahoma City, OK. She left her purse with a friend at the bar and left with an unknown male in his vehicle to a local motel. She has never been seen again.

In February 2021, Brittney Simpson took to Facebook for more information on her mother’s disappearance. In a saddening post, she revealed their family indeed believes their beloved mother was murdered. 22 years later their family still yearns for an answer. 

Kitty is described as being Native American, standing 4’11, 135lbs with brown hair and hazel eyes. She has two tribal tattoos (possibly blue or purple in color) on her right ankle and in 1999 her tongue was pierced. She was last seen wearing a white shirt, jeans (possibly by Levi), black boots or sneakers, and lots of tribal rings and bracelet.

TOWSON, Md. (WJZ) — Forty years after the murder of a Halethorpe teen, Baltimore County police have identified her killer.
The police department said Wednesday that cold case detectives have determined John Anthony Petrecca, Jr., who died in 2000, was responsible for the 1981 murder of 13-year-old Heather Porter.
“As a result of advances in forensic technology, Heather Porter’s family members now know the identity of the person who took their loved ones life,” the agency said. “The Baltimore County Police Department would like to thank Bode Technology, the Hackerman Foundation

and the FBI for their expert analysis, assistance and support in solving this cold case.”
Porter’s body was found in the woods near Ridgewood Road and Goucher Boulevard in Towson on Sept. 24, 1981, a day after she went missing from her Halethorpe neighborhood. An autopsy found she had been sexually assaulted and strangled.

Though investigators had some of the suspect’s DNA, the homicide case turned cold and went unsolved for four decades. It wasn’t until last year that detectives gave Porter’s killing a second look.
The suspect’s DNA was sent off lab testing and the results were provided to the FBI.

In February, police zeroed in on Petrecca as a possible suspect. A search of his criminal background found he had multiple rape arrests over the years, and police determined that he lived near the area where Porter was last seen alive.
After getting permission to exhume Petrecca’s remains from a local cemetery, police sent his DNA off for lab testing. The results showed it was a match for Porter’s killer.",UnresolvedMysteries,40 Years Later: Police Solve Baltimore County Teen's Cold Case Murder,0

I came across the Jamie Fraley story, and I feel for the family since it's pretty much fallen off the radar. Personally, I feel the bf's dad was involved, he definitely had motive and access, and a track record - although, with the latest breakthrough's in missing persons cases where they find a car in some water (decades later it seems), it's made me re-think a lot of these cases.

Seeing that there were sightings of Jamie in 2015, that turned out to be false, do you think this case is as obvious as it seems, or did she take off in a car with someone unknown?

(see links at bottom for more info / videos)

Intense stomach pain has left a young woman seeking a ride to the hospital for a third time in 24 hours. Her last known phone call at 1:30 am ends abruptly when an unidentified man pulls up to give her a ride. Two months later, with authorities and family desperate - could the answers be connected to the awful smell coming from a hot car trunk?

22 year old Jamie Fraley was described by her mother as sweet and feisty and driven to do good. Jamie had suffered from bipolar and anxiety throughout her life, which had made things like graduating high school or getting a driver’s license difficult. AT the time she was last seen, Jaime was living on social security disability and regularly meeting with a social worker. In the few years leading up to her disappearance the young woman had made huge strides in her life and was now attending a local community college with plans to become a substance abuse counselor – although she had never used drugs her self.

In 2006, Jamie met her fiancé Ricky Simmonds, Jr and the two moved in together at the Copperfield apartment complex in Gastonia. The happy couple wouldn’t be together long though, Simmonds had a criminal record, and in early 2007, he was sentenced to 15 months in state prison for theft. During this period Jamie would keep in regular contact with him.

Although, her fiancé was in prison, his father, Ricky Simmonds, Sr lived in the same apartment complex just two doors away from Jamie. A former felon himself, Ricky Sr – who worked part time as a maintenance guy at the complex – had served 6 years in prison in the 1980s on manslaughter charges related to the strangling of his then girlfriend.

Now in 2008, Ricky Sr’s love life was on the rocks again, he had recently been dumped by his girlfriend, Kim – who had accused him of stalking, but more on that later. With no girlfriend and a son in prison,- Ricky Sr had some time on his hands, some of which he spent helping out Jaime with errands around town.

It is known that Ricky Sr gave Jamie one ride to the hospital on the last day she was seen. Law enforcement has not released any evidence to tie Ricky Sr to Jaime’s disappearance, but he was a person of interest. Some sources have reported that Ricky Sr was obsessed with his son’s fiancé, and given his own criminal history of stalking and sexual predation, may have crossed one too many lines.

Feeling awful, Jamie attempted to get a ride to the hospital for a third time in the early morning of August 8. After a midnight call to her mother, where she refused a ride – Jaime made a call to an unidentified friend at 1:30 am, which she cut short due to her ride showing up – she reportedly referred to the driver of the car as a “he”, but didn’t say who. That was the last time anyone would see Jamie Fraley. She never made it to the hospital for that third visit.

The next day a healthcare provider visited Jamie’s apartment, but she was not home.

Alarmed by hearing she missed an appointment, Fraley’s family went to her apartment. The unit was locked and their daughter was not home. Upon entering there were no signs of a struggle or foul play, with only Jamie’s cell phone gone the apartment still contained her wallet, purse, keys, and ID. The family did report that Jamie had vomited several times in the apartment, and also that the shoe laces from her favorite shoes were gone.

It was then Jamie’s family reported her missing to police.

The first clue in the case arrived 2 days later, when Jamie’s cell phone was found by a utility worker in some overgrown grass by the roadside about 3 miles from her apartment. The phone appeared to have been tossed out the window of a vehicle. Despite this clue, finding the phone didn’t reveal any fingerprints or scents for search dogs to follow.

Soon after Jamie’s fiancé, Ricky Jr, was released from prison, and moved in with Jamie’s family joining them in their search. But it must have made for some awkward father son moments.

Since Jamie’s disappearance, suspicion had immediate fell on to Ricky Sr, as he was the last person to have seen Jamie, and had been interviewed by police. Police became more suspicious of him when he became linked to a bag of trash found on a roadside – prompting them to seek a warrant they were never able to fully serve.

Because - The most bizarre thing about Ricky Sr was yet to happen.

As we mentioned, Ricky Sr had been stalking his ex-girlfriend Kim, who had got a restraining order against him in May of that year. On June 7, two months after Jamie’s disappearance, Kim – who recently had her purse and car keys stolen – noticed a strange odor which appeared to be coming from her car. After a few days, Kim opened the trunk to find the lifeless body of Ricky Sr.

Authorities believe Ricky attempted to ambush his ex by hiding in her trunk. Things didn’t go according to plan, and between the drugs and alcohol found in his system and the intense oven like temperatures the former convicted felon had died from accidental heatstroke – with Kim’s car keys and stolen purse on his body – along with a knife which authorities suspect he planned to use against his ex.

With the death of Ricky Sr the investigation was almost at a standstill. Now a key witness and person of interest was dead, and with him the possible answers about Jamie’s disappearance.

Law enforcement does not believe she left on her own, and since she lacked a license or a vehicle, it would have been nearly impossible for her to do so – so they believe someone else has to be involved.

Although it has been over 10 years, Jamie’s case remains unsolved. Her family’s hope that she may be alive was recharged around 2015 by a tip which suggested Jaimie may be living in Arizona or Nevada and had been seen in an online ad working as an escort. Unfortunately, the lead in question was tracked down, and the woman seen in the ad was not Jaime.

Over the years new clues have dried up, and media coverage has waned – but Gaston County PD revisited the cold case in 2019. Jaimie’s mother is now in a race against time, as she battles her own mortality . As the years go by with no answers, Jaime’s mother remains spiritual and said she is seeking peace and is still hoping for a reunion with her daughter.

Over a decade later this case has scarcely any more clues than it had within the first 48 hours - but Jaime’s mother is convinced someone out there holds the answers – someone out there knows what happened.

808,TheBryanWorters,1638475029,"The Jasper County Coroner’s Office, in collaboration with Redgrave Research Forensic Services, will be holding a press conference regarding updates in the case of Jasper County John Doe, who was an unidentified victim of serial killer Larry Eyler.  The press conference will take place at 5:00 PM CST (4:00 PM PST, 6:00 PM EST). A livestream of the conference will be available on both WTHR.com and on WTHR’s FaceBook page.  

**Case Summary**  

On the morning of October 15th, 1983, an individual setting and checking fox traps on private property near the town of Rensselaer in Jasper County, Indiana came across what he believed to be human remains. He immediately contacted Jasper County authorities, with responding officer Paul Ricker being the first on the scene. Ricker and his colleagues observed partial skeletal remains strewn about the property, with many of the pieces fragmented. After the bone fragments were gathered, they were sent to Jasper County’s (then) coroner, Dr. Stephen Spicer. In collaboration with Dr. John Pless of the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis, the two would deduce much from the sum of thirty bone fragments recovered.

The victim was estimated to be a white male, approximately 18 to 26 years of age, had shoulder-length reddish-brown hair, stood at an estimated 5’6” (168 cm) to 5’8” (172 cm), and was believed to have previously fractured his left femur. Stainless steel tooth caps were noted at teeth #19 and #30, along with amalgam restorations at #2, #3, and #12. Anthropologist consultation suggests that one of the restored teeth was applied backward. Several articles of clothing were also discovered at the scene, including a gray hooded sweatshirt, a pair of Levi brand jeans and a brown belt in a size 28”, gray/burgundy socks, and suede athletic shoes in a size 11 ½. Additionally, a zippo lighter with the name ‘ARLENE’ engraved onto it was found near the remains. Officials determined that the young man was the victim of a homicide and estimated that he had been deceased for approximately one to two years prior to his discovery. Despite the numerous identifying characteristics, no missing person reports in the area fit the man’s description, nor did anyone claim to know the identity of John Doe.  

Not long after this discovery, authorities linked the remains to a rash of murders in Indiana and Illinois, with many of the victims speculated to be hitchhikers, sex workers, and/or were members of the LGBTQ+ community. The murder series ended with the arrest of Larry Eyler, who was later convicted of two counts of homicide and sentenced to death. But before Eyler’s execution date was slated to happen, he died from AIDS-related complications on March 6th, 1994. Two days after his death, his attorney, Kathleen Zellner, held a press conference which disclosed that Eyler had confessed to a further 19 murder victims, including the unidentified young man found in Jasper County over a decade earlier.

Eyler recalled picking up a hitchhiker — a young man possibly in his early 20s — along Highway 41 on or around the weekend of November 20th, 1982. He believed that his encounter took place somewhere near Vincennes, Indiana. Eyler murdered the young man and dumped his body in the field near Rensselaer, where the fox trapper found his body just over one year later.   

To assist in the search for John Doe’s identity, Anthony Redgrave has rendered a new forensic image of him based on photos of the skull, the description that Eyler had provided, and in consultation with anthropologist Dr. Samantha Blatt of Idaho State University. Redgrave Research would like to thank DNA Solutions for DNA extraction, HudsonAlpha Discovery for the whole-genome sequencing, and Kevin Lord of Saber Investigations for bioinformatics. We would also like to thank investigators Andy and Diana Boersma of the Jasper County Coroner’s Office; Kathleen Zellner; everyone who has been involved in Ellis’s case since his discovery; and those who have continued to spend their time, effort, and dedication to honoring a young man who they never personally knew.

A passerby strolling the alleys of New York City would come across a deceased body that had clearly been strangled. Later it is identified as an African American woman.

Meanwhile, in Pleasantville, NJ, a father and his two daughters lie waiting for their mom and wife. Last seen leaving her home on Pleasant Ave for work, Viola A. Butler never comes home. Her family immediately files a missing persons report. 

It is determined that Viola made it to her workplace via cab, parked her car in Atlantic City Expressway, and waited for the shuttle to take her to the entrance of the Bally’s Park Place Casino where she worked  the midnight to 8am shift as a parking attendant. A witness came forward at that time stating that she seen Viola get into a mid-sized red sports car with tinted windows. She never boarded the shuttle to work. 

In 2000, Viola’s house was foreclosed and purchased by a development company. Before demolishing, K-9s checked the property for remains to no avail. In 2019, a group nicknamed the WebSluethers would post Viola’s case on their blog, where coincidentally one of her daughters was internet searching her mother’s name and stumbled across the blog and commented her heartbreaking attestation that law enforcement had “lost her mother’s case”.  Later, a  “WebSluether” from the blog would make the connection between missing person Viola and NYC Jane Done UP9629. Several members from the blog would then make efforts to contact Viola’s daughter so that she could contact law enforcement to confirm the NYC Jane Doe and Viola were one in the same.

Just months after web surfing for any existence of her mother, Viola’s daughter received confirmation that NYC Jane Doe was indeed her mother. Posting confirmation for “Websluethers” and thanking them for their assistance. While a mother has finally been laid to rest, the circumstances surrounding her disappearance and death are still needing answers. How did she get to NY and whom did she leave with? These are questions Viola’s two daughters ponder.

811,Anya5678,1638473561,"**Background:** On October 5th 1980, a murder victim was found in Henderson, NV near the Arroyo Grande wash. She was killed by blunt force trauma, believed to be inflicted with a hammer. She also had puncture wounds to her upper back. The decedent was believed to be a white female between 13 and 25 years old. She had brownish-red or strawberry blonde hair, stood 5 ft to 5 ft 4 inches tall, and weighed 98 to 110 pounds. She had a few dental fillings and an amateur tattoo of the letter S on her right forearm.

A DNA profile was developed by the University of North Texas, and she had been exhumed 4 times for further investigation.

**Update:** Today she has been identified as Tammy Corrine Terrell from Roswell, New Mexico. Tammy was 17 years old at the time of death. Forensic genealogy led to Tammy's two sisters. Per the article ""Terrell was last seen on Sept. 28, 1980. She had been dropped off at the Roswell State Fair. Around 10 p.m. she was seen at a Roswell restaurant with a white man and woman."" A week later she was found deceased in Henderson, NV. Tammy's killer remains unknown, but police are investigating.

RIP Tammy.

824,gaycatdetective,1638427124,"Background and Identification: 

Rebecca Boyd was 29 years old with two young children when she disappeared in 2002. Her estranged husband reported her missing on July 30, 2002. She had last been seen near Lawton, Oklahoma on July 26, 2002. Rebecca, a resident of Muskogee, was not from the area, but was known to visit family in the area.

On July 13, 2005, a farmer discovered a human skull in his field. No other remains were recovered, and a cause of death could not be determined. The site where the skull was discovered was just a quarter mile away from where a victim of a serial killer operating in the area had been discovered two years earlier. In September 2021, University of North Texas discovered a match when Rebecca's DNA profile was uploaded. Now the OSBI is hoping her identification could lead to her killer. Her son Todd, who was 9 when she disappeared,  fears he may never receive answers.

Although Rebecca was reported relatively quickly after her disappearance, I could find only one search result about her case from before she was identified. A Facebook page titled Oklahoma Cold Case made a post about her on March 7, 2020 which provided a few details about her appearance, but there was not much information available otherwise. Rebecca had four tattoos, but this would ultimately prove unhelpful in her identification since it was three years before remains were recovered, and it was not a full recovery. 

Theories:

I would be very interested to know who Rebecca was visiting, how frequently she visited, if anyone traveled with her, and what the arrangements were like. Did she ever take her children with her? Did she always go alone or travel with a friend? How did she get there? Did she stay at someone's house or in a hotel/motel? Unfortunately there is just not a lot to go on here.

There was a serial killer operating in the Lawton area between 1999 and 2003. (I will not go into much detail about that on this post, but will link to a thorough write up from this sub down below.) Though 5 of the 6 victims were known sex workers in the Cache Road area, we do not know enough about Rebecca to know if she may have been a sex worker or not. No news articles about her identification mention her as a possible victim of the Lawton serial killer except to say her body was discovered very close to where one of the victims had been dumped (likely Pamela Woodring). However, the OSBI made comments that alluded to this being a homicide investigation despite the cause of death being unknown. (4 of the other victims' cause of death could also not be determined, and the remaining 2 were initially classified as overdoses.)

The timeline and geographical location of where she was discovered fits well with the Lawton serial killer, but the other victims were discovered in or near water. And a major difference is that in this case, only a skull was recovered. It is unknown if she was doing sex work in the area but I don't think it matters. If she was from out of town and was staying in a motel along Cache Road, the killer could have mistaken her for one just for being in an area known for sex work. Or maybe he was not specifically targeting sex workers, just vulnerable young women in the area. 

Do you think she could have been a victim of the Lawton serial killer? If not, what are your theories?

Regardless, I am glad Rebecca has been identified and reunited with her family. I hope this does lead them one step closer to answers, and possibly answers for the other women's families as well.

826,unsolvedbb1,1638424945,"I mentioned this case in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/r54hqt/when_researching_missing_persons_cases_do_you/) I started. Just a few days ago, the Doe Network updated her case file with some new information.

On Friday, June 10, 1983, 25-year-old single mother Graciela ""Grace"" Esquivel dropped her six-year-old daughter Angie off with her (Grace's) parents for an overnight visit. She said she was going out with friends. When her parents Armando and Manuela went to drop Angie off the next day, they discovered a chilling scene.

Their daughter's driver's license and wallet (I've read no mention of her car or keys also being present, so I'm going to assume they were both gone) were in the house and her bed had been neatly turned down as if she were ready to go to sleep. Everything was there...except for Grace. She has never been seen again and there has been no activity on her social security number since 1983.

On November 29, 2021, The Doe Network updated Grace's case file to include a piece of info which may or may not be relevant. A few weeks before her mysterious disappearance, Grace called her sister who lived in Texas and asked if she could stay with her for a few weeks; the sister declined her request. 

There is admittedly very little info about this case which appears to have gotten no coverage locally even at the time. In the thread I linked to earlier, I mentioned that cases such as this with such short summaries and no real media coverage often lead me (and I'm sure other people who like researching cold cases) to really question the few nuggets of information contained in said summaries. Here are some of the questions and observations I made re: Grace Esquivel:

&amp;#x200B;

* Was it ever confirmed that Grace actually went out with friends that night? The reason I question this because if you read the wording of the Charley Project page (which hasn't been updated), it says that she asked her parents to watch her daughter ""because Esquivel ***said*** she was going out with friends"" (emphasis mine). Indeed, [the original Doe Network write-up](https://web.archive.org/web/20180929094347/http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/111dfia.html) also uses that phrasing, although the updated version simply says she went out with friends. I'm going to assume she most likely did and that said friends were questioned.

&amp;#x200B;

* I mentioned in the aforementioned thread that Grace's keys and car were intact. This appears to be an error on my part as I have been unable to find any description of the case that mentions either one being present. So that begs the question — was Grace's car and/or keys found at the house?  If not, then it would appear that she decided to go back out or was forced to do so by an unknown party after arriving home from her night out. If the car was never found, it could be that she simply had an accident and crashed into a body of water. A tragic but not uncommon scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

* If Grace was abducted from her home, I have a feeling that it was by someone she knew and trusted based on the fact that there were apparently no signs of a struggle. Could it have been one of the friends she was with that night? Or perhaps another friend or partner that her family and social group weren't familiar with?

&amp;#x200B;

* When did Grace's parents first realize she was missing? I ask this because I could swear that I read a summary of the case which said that Grace planned to go to her parents' house herself the next day to pick up Angie. If that was the original plan, had they tried calling her and got no answer, which prompted them to take Angie home themselves? And what time of day did they bring her home? If it was later in the day, then we may have no real way of knowing exactly when Grace went missing.

&amp;#x200B;

* Without more context on the phone call to her sister, I can't say whether it's related to Grace's disappearance or not. The piece of info seems kind of random and almost added as an afterthought to the case summary. It literally just says that she asked her sister in Texas if she could stay with her for awhile and that the sister said no. And? Was Grace frantic about staying in Texas? Did she indicate that she feared someone or something in Iowa? Did she name any names? 

&amp;#x200B;

829,TheBonesOfAutumn,1638404258,"On the afternoon of May 18, 1969, 10-year-old Cynthia Warrick left her New Haven, Indiana home to go out and play. It was 3:30pm and Cynthia planned to walk to the local drugstore, a popular place in town where kids went to browse the comic books, buy candy, and use the pay phone to call friends. When she failed to return home on time later that evening, Cynthia’s parents, Ruth and Billie Warrick, assumed Cynthia was at a friends house. However as the night wore on, and Cynthia failed to make contact, her parents grew more concerned. Shortly before 11pm Ruth and Billie reported their daughter missing. 

Cynthia was the youngest of the Warrick’s three children, and their only daughter. She was a fourth grade student at Sunnymede Elementary School and was in the special education class, however by all accounts she was a very bright, lively, and independent student who never let her disability stop her from doing what everyone else did. 

Cynthia was also known as quite the “tomboy.” According to her teachers, she preferred pants over dresses, didn’t like her hair to be brushed or styled, and could always be found challenging, and mostly beating, the boys on the playground at races or other “playground competitions.” She was also known to be somewhat of a “daredevil.” Less than a week prior, Cynthia had leapt from a swing at a neighbors house, resulting in a broken wrist and a trip to the hospital where her arm was wrapped in a white plaster cast.  

When police arrived at the Warrick’s home, located at 177 Sturm Street, they took the report from her parents and the search for Cynthia began. It was learned Cynthia *had* made it to the drugstore, her intended destination. The clerk immediately recognized a picture of Cynthia, as she had been to the store countless times in the past. He informed police that he had seen Cynthia earlier that day. According to him, she had used the pay phone, browsed the candy and comics, and then exited the store. 

A second witness recalled seeing Cynthia walking nearby a short time later past a place called “Pal’s,” a truck stop where Cynthia’s parents worked during the week, located near the junction of highways US 30 and US 24. A third and final witness claimed to see Cynthia walking through the parking lot of “King’s,” a department store located just a short distance from the drugstore in town. After the last sighting however, it appeared as though Cynthia had vanished. 

Police continued to search throughout the night, however found no trace of her. The following day, around noon, a truck driver from Fort Wayne, Indiana named Raymond Evard, pulled off of Indiana Highway 14 to take a nap. When he awoke, something white protruding from the nearby woods caught his eye. Upon closer inspection he discovered the lifeless body of a young girl with a white cast on her arm. Raymond flagged down another passing truck driver and together, the pair summoned police. 

The body was quickly identified as belonging to Cynthia Warrick. The location Cynthia’s body was found was approximately two miles from New Haven, in a muddy, wooded area, 37 feet off of Highway 14. She was found partially nude, and had multiple bruises and lacerations on her face and head. An autopsy would conclude however, that Cynthia’s killer had ultimately strangled her to death with a rope. The autopsy also confirmed that Cynthia had been sexually assaulted. 

Cynthia was laid to rest the following Friday in Greenlawn Cemetery. Her parents, two brothers, and her eleven classmates accompanied by their teacher and school principal attended the small funeral service. News of Cynthia’s murder rocked the small town of New Haven. A group of local business owners and citizens rallied together and raised more than 2,000 dollars as a reward for information about her murder, however the few tips they received ultimately led nowhere. Sadly, with few clues and no suspects her case quickly faded from the headlines. 

52 years later, the murder of Cynthia Warrick remains unsolved.

I cannot find a confirmed photo of Cynthia, however I did find a yearbook from Sunnymede Elementary School from 1966. I’m assuming Cynthia attended the same school at this time and would be in the 1st grade, however the book has no names of the kids. I’m going to include the link to the yearbook below, however like I said, I do not know which child, if any, is Cynthia.

830,JonWilso,1638399346,"On September 23 1981, 13-year-old Heather Porter went missing from her Halethorpe neighborhood. A day later, a man walking his dog discovered the teen’s body in a wooded area near Ridgewood Road and Goucher Boulevard in Towson. Based on the condition of the victim’s body, investigators believed the person responsible dragged the girl’s body into the woods. An autopsy later determined the teen had been strangled and sexually assaulted.

While detectives had a DNA sample of the suspect, it has taken decades and advancements in DNA technology to identify a suspect. Baltimore County detectives with the BCoPD Homicide Cold Case Squad, reviewed the Porter case and requested the suspect’s DNA profile be submitted for forensic genealogy. Bode Technology analyzed the sample and forwarded their results to the FBI for further analysis.

In February of 2021, results identified John Anthony Petrecca, Jr., as a possible suspect in the murder of 13-year-old Heather Porter. A check of Petrecca’s criminal history showed prior arrests for rape in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Baltimore County Homicide Cold Case detectives determined, at the time of the killing, Petrecca resided in the 100 block of Ridge Ave., in Halethorpe, Maryland. The location is a short distance from where Heather Porter was last seen. 

In an effort to identify Porter’s killer, detectives obtained written authorization from the Baltimore County State’s Attorney’s Office to exhume Petrecca’s remains.On the morning of March 11, 2021, police personnel and members from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner gathered at a local cemetery in Baltimore County where Petrecca was buried in 2000.DNA recovered during the exhumation process was sent to Bode Technology for processing. 

On November 12, 2021, detectives learned the DNA obtained from Petrecca matched that of the suspect’s DNA profile. As a result of advances in forensic technology, Heather Porter’s family members now know the identity of the person who took their loved ones life. The Baltimore County Police Department would like to thank Bode Technology, the Hackerman Foundation and the FBI for their expert analysis, assistance and support in solving this cold case.

831,CherryBlossom724,1638397065,"* **The Newton family**

Francis Newton was born in New Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1853. He moved to Brookfield, MA, as a young man where he got a job as a milkman. Later on, he managed a bakery in Hartford, Connecticut, and married a woman named Sarah. Together, the two adopted a baby girl from Sweden, whom they named Ethel and whose nickname was ""Elsie"". They continued to live in Hartford until 1896, when they moved into a dilapidated home on Sturbridge Road in a rural area of Brookfield. Francis worked hard to fix up their new home and barn, and made their property into ""a very fair farm"". 

Paul Mueller, a German immigrant, arrived at the Point of Pines resort, north of Sturbridge, MA, in 1897. He was poor and looking for work. The man who ran the resort, Captain H. D. Hodgson, offered to allow Mueller to stay at his resort for free in exchange for doing carpentry (at which Mueller was said to be very skilled) and repair work. During his time there, Mueller even built a brace (something he claimed to have learned in the German army) for a horse's leg, saving the horse's life. 

In October, 1897, Mueller and Hodgson had a falling out, the reason for which is unknown, and Mueller left the Point of Pines resort. In need of a new living arrangement, Mueller sought employment from Francis Newton, whose farmhouse was only a few miles from the Point of Pines resort. Newton agreed to hire him and in addition to paying him for his work (something that Hodgson never did), he also allowed Mueller to live with him and his family, giving him his own room to stay in. Newton was reportedly pleased with Mueller's work and Mueller himself was described as being generally ""efficient and agreeable"", though he was known to have a bad temper at times. 

The last time any member of the Newton family had been seen alive was on January 7th, 1898. Their neighbors, Elmer Newcomb, William Bemis, and William Eaton started to become concerned when they noticed that the Newtons' cows were lowing loudly and desperately and found, upon investigation, that they were unfed and that they hadn't been milked in a couple of days. It was not at all like Francis Newton to neglect his livestock, but his neighbors didn't assume the worst just yet. Their best guess at this point was that the family had decided to leave for the weekend and just didn't tell anyone. After another day went by with no sign of the Newton family, Eaton and Newcomb decided to form a search party and the group went over to the Newtons' house around 10pm. No one answered their knocks or calls, except for the Newtons' dog, who was barking frantically. They walked around the house and found an unlocked window and entered that way. They found Francis, Sarah and Elsie dead in their respective beds, each having been bludgeoned to death (apparently in their sleep) by the blunt side of an axe. Nothing appeared to have been stolen and there was no evidence of sexual assault.

The doors were locked from the inside and it appears that the killer attempted to set the house on fire before he left, as there was a pile of wood soaked in kerosene inside, but only a few sticks had caught on fire and then fizzled out before the fire could spread to the kerosene soaked wood. Conspicuously absent from this scene was the farmhand Paul Mueller, who had last been seen buying a train ticket nearby at 1:05am on the (presumed) night of the murders. Mueller, being the obvious suspect here, (though it's unclear what his motive was) was searched for by detectives but was never found.

This brings me to my next point. The authors of *The Man from the Train: The Solving of a Century-Old Serial Killer Mystery* believe that this case was just the first in a long series of murders by Paul Mueller. From their extensive research, they feel certain (or just reasonably certain in some of these cases) that the following series of axe murders were all committed by Mueller:

* **The Van Lieus** (2 victims) were murdered on November 17, 1900, in Trenton Corners, New Jersey.

* **The Allen family** (3 victims) was murdered on May 12, 1901, in Shirley, Maine. 

* **The Kelly family** (5 victims) was murdered on October 31, 1903, in Cottondale Florida.

* **The Hodges family** (5 victims) was murdered on July 28, 1904 in Statesboro, Georgia.

* **The Hughes family** (4 victims) was murdered on December 8th, 1904 in Trenton, South Carolina.

* **The Linkouses** (2 victims) were murdered on December 25, 1904 in Radford, Virginia.

* **The Boylan family** (3 victims) was murdered on February 7, 1905 in Marion, Arkansas.

* **The Wise family** (5 victims) was murdered on September 21, 1905, in Jacksonville, Florida.

* **The Christmas family** (3 victims) was murdered on February 7, 1906, in Cottonwood, Alabama.

* **The Ackerman family** (9 victims) was murdered on May 13, 1906, in Allentown, Florida.

* **The Lyerly family** (4 victims) was murdered on July 13th, 1906, in Barber Junction, North Carolina.

* **The Meadows family** (6 victims) was murdered on September 21, 1909, in Hurley, Virginia.

* **The Hood family** (4 victims) was murdered on October 31, 1909, in Beckley, West Virginia. 

* **The Schultz family** (5 victims) was murdered on March 11, 1910, in Houston Heights, Texas.

* **The Hardy family** (3 victims) was murdered on June 5, 1910, in Marshalltown, Iowa.

* **The Bernhardt family** (4 victims) was murdered on December 7, 1910, in Johnson County, Kansas.

* **The Casaway family** (5 victims) was murdered on March 21, 1911, in San Antonio, Texas.

* **The Hill family** (4 victims) was murdered on June 9, 1911, in Ardenwald, Oregon.

* **The Cobles** (2 victims) were murdered on July 11, 1911, in Rainier, Washington.

* **The Wayne family** (3 victims) was murdered on September 17, 1911, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

* **The Burnham family** (3 victims), was murdered on September 17, 1911, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

* **The Dawson family** (3 victims) was murdered on September 30, 1911, in Monmouth, Illinois.

* **The Showman family** (5 victims) was murdered on October 15, 1911, in Ellsworth, Kansas.

* **The Moore family** (8 victims, including two sisters named Lena and Ina Mae Stillinger who were friends with the oldest daughter, Mary Katherine Moore) was murdered on June 10, 1912, in Villisca, Iowa. This is by far the most famous of these cases.

* **The Pfanschmidt family** (4 victims) was murdered on September 27, 1912.


It's important to note that in many of these cases a suspect was arrested, though often based on little to no evidence. In some of these cases the suspect was released before the case went to trial. In a couple cases, someone was convicted of the crime but later released due to the belief that this person had been wrongfully convicted. In other cases someone was convicted and eventually executed (or murdered by a lynch mob).

However, in all of these cases most (or in some cases all) of the following elements were present:

* The blunt side of the axe was used

* The axe belonged to the victims and was left at or near the crime scene after the murders

* A young girl was present in most of these cases and this serial killer seemed to have a fixation on young girls. Often times, the body of a young girl was the only one that the killer seemed to pay much attention to and was posed postmortem. It is also hinted at in several cases that the killer masturbated over the dead body of a young girl.

* The mirrors were covered in cloth. The heads of the victims were covered with a blanket.

* The crimes took place in rural areas or small towns

* Close proximity to the railroad tracks (typically within a quarter of a mile) and in many cases the location was near the intersection of two railroad lines

* The murderer either setting fire to the house or locking it up tight and/or jamming the door before leaving

* Leaving a lamp burning without its glass chimney at the crime scene

* Nothing being stolen, despite valuables being left out in plain sight

At a few crime scenes, bloody size six footprints were found leading away from the property. 

For reference, here is Paul Mueller's description: He was a short man, with long greasy dark hair, a mustache and occasionally a beard. He was said to be about 35 in 1898. He had small, widely spaced teeth and wore a *size six* in shoes.

Many of these crimes occurred in logging areas, so the authors believe that it's possible that the killer may have worked in the logging industry.

**Saint-George-de-Beauce QC, Canada**

&amp;#x200B;

Alexandre was a 20 year old young man. On the 22nd of February 2002, he had gone out to drink with friends at said friends' home at  11 150 , 127th street in Saint-George. At around 9 pm, Alexandre's friends wanted to go out to grab a bite to eat, but Alexandre felt too inhebriated and decided to stay put and wait for his friends to come back.

By the time his friends came back, the house was completely ablaze. His friends naturally thought that Alexandre was in the house while it was burning and that he had died as a result. 

However, on the next morning, officers from the Sureté du Québec (Quebec provincial police) who were investigating the scene of the fire could not find any trace of a body inside the ruins of the burnt-down house.  However, they would confirm that the fire had started under suspect conditions.

According to people interviewed afterwards, it seems that Alexandre was hanging out with questionable people and that it might have led to problems for him.

His mother would bring up an incident from the day before his disappearance where Alexandre had called her and said he ""had something to talk about"" with her. When pressed to be more specific about it, Alexandre had told her that it ""was not something that can be discussed over the phone"".

She is also convinced that something bad had to have happened that night because, acccording to her, Alexandre was absolutely not the kind of person who'd just burn his friend's house down and then take off to go on a road trip across the country without warning anybody.

But at the same time. While they knew their son struggled with substance abuse problems and had questionable relations, they couldn't imagine Alexandre doing something so bad that he'd get murdered over it.

Almost 20 years later, the case is still unsolved and no traces of Alexandre have been found after repeated searches of the location where the house used to stand.

The case quickly went cold. Investigators initially focused on Soriano's stepfather and a handyman at their apartment complex, but both had alibis. They also questioned residents of the complex and the teenager's many friends and relatives. All were cleared. All that the killer left behind was a patch of DNA that had no matches.

* Recent developments 

The murder of Minnie Soriano went unsolved for 22 years. But in 2021, NYPD detectives decided to try a relatively new investigative technique called ""familial DNA matching."" Unlike their previous DNA database searches, which relied on a 100% identical profile, familial matching looks for partial matches indicating closely related sources.* 

Using this technique, detectives found a very close relative of Minnie's killer--likely his biological father. That man had since died, but investigators tracked down his son, Joseph Martinez. Martinez lived in the same apartment as the Soriano family in 1999, and was even questioned in the initial investigation, but was never a suspect. Investigators obtained a sample of Martinez's DNA and found it was a 100% match to the sample taken from Minnie's sweater.

On November 30, 2021, the NYPD arrested Joseph Martinez. He was arraigned and pled not guilty to murder. Martinez, 49, is an amateur astronomer and Youtuber under the name ""Jupiter Joe."" He was a fixture in local parks, where he offered passers-by lessons in astronomy and a look at the stars through his telescope.

Minnie's family expressed their relief to reporters, but said the arrest comes far too late to bring closure. They mourn everyday for the girl taken so painfully from them on that day in February, 22 years ago. Minnie's relatives remember her as a kind, diligent young girl who loved to write poetry, ride her bike or roller-skate around the complex, and read romance novels. Neighbors called her the ""Cinderella"" of their apartment complex. 

Minnie's family also spoke of their disgust with her killer. Her aunt Amelia Soriano said ""He threw her in the garbage--in the dumpster, [like] she was the garbage. She was not garbage, she was a human being."" Her father, Luis, had only this to say to Martinez: ""I hope you go to hell.""

*Note that the technique used in this case is different from forensic genetic genealogy, which is the process used most famously in the Golden State Killer investigation. FGG uses very distant (second or more cousin-level) matches to build a family tree of the suspect. Investigators in this case were only looking for nuclear family matches of the suspect.

In late August 2021, a Tennessee man cut off his penis and tossed it out the window as he led police on a high-speed chase through two counties. After the pursuit ended, the man told police he chopped off his penis because he had to “save the world.”

The man, Tyson Gilbert, drove a Honda Accord on Highway 70 in Dowelltown, Tennessee -about an hour west of Nashville- when officers flashed their lights at him, indicating they wanted him to stop his vehicle. It was a Tuesday and Gilbert’s plans did not include getting pulled over by police.

Gilbert did not stop. Instead, he gave the police a chase they won’t soon forget.

I think 90% of the things people focus on in that case (trouble at West Point, credit card theft, etc.) has nothing to do with what ultimately ended up happening to her. Sure, when you have a missing person it is important to examine the events leading up to the disappearance, but I think people get way to caught up on all the little details of her life. The events beforehand are only relevant in the sense that they explain why she took off in the first place: she was under a great deal of stress and simply wanted to get away for a few days. I don’t think any of it has anything to do with what happened to her after the accident.

This was the situation the parents of Kyle Vaughan found themselves in when they received a knock in the early hours of the morning from police to tell them their son had been involved in a car crash.

But all that remained was a smashed-up Peugeot 306 with no clue as to what happened to the driver.

[Rita Hester](https://uncovered.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f963a3c9fd4f940a88db4f88e&amp;id=f32f2d22bd&amp;e=27ba58e8dc) was a lively and creative woman. She grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, and was the youngest of five children. She moved to Boston where she found a community of people who lifted her up, and she quickly built a reputation for her musical talents and exuberance.

**The day Rita was killed.** Typically, Rita would return home to Connecticut to spend Thanksgiving with her family.[ However, in 1998, she decided to stay in Boston](https://uncovered.com/cases/rita-hester). Rita was known to frequent different clubs in her area where she would perform as a singer. Earlier in the day of November 28, Rita went to her friend, Brenda Wynne’s home to watch ice skating on TV. Later that evening, she got a call from a friend to grab a drink at one of Rita’s favorite local bars, Silhouettes. They made plans to meet up at 7PM. However, Rita never made it to Silhouettes.

**When she was discovered.** [Shortly after 6PM Rita’s neighbor called 9-1-1](https://uncovered.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f963a3c9fd4f940a88db4f88e&amp;id=abfb9cf1c7&amp;e=27ba58e8dc) about loud noises inside her apartment. When police arrived, Rita was barely alive as a result of 20 stab wounds to her chest. She would later die from cardiac arrest—two days before her 35th birthday. 

Police focused their investigation on her final hours, and the lot behind the apartment building where Rita lived; but ultimately, no leads were found. [Additionally, news outlets would misgender Rita in the media when reporting on her death.](https://uncovered.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f963a3c9fd4f940a88db4f88e&amp;id=531192a881&amp;e=27ba58e8dc)

However, Rita’s case was reopened by Boston authorities in 2006  per her mother’s request.

850,VocalPariah,1638287370,"Teen With Two Lives: The Unresolved Murder of Nadine Reyes

On July 8th, 2002, a homeless man wandering through the cold San Francisco winds stumbled onto the streets of Treat Ave and 17th/18th Street.  Known as the Mission District, this area was known for its Latino culture and colorful art that painted the shops and stores up and down the block. Seeing a trashcan, he decided to wheel it down the block. After finally opening the container,he would discover the lifeless body of a young woman stuffed face first in a trash can, later to be identified as recent high school graduate, Nadine Reyes. 

Nadine Reyes had recently graduated high school and turned 18 years old. Residing in Sacramento, CA for her last years of high school, the teen had done quite a bit of moving. First attending high school in San Francisco before finally graduating at Del Campo High School in Sacramento. Though not mentioned in the articles, I found a few high school friends that vividly remember Nadine, and it revealed why the teen attended several high schools.

Nadine’s father, Stephen Reyes, and other family members described the teen as “a good student who was about to join the Army”. Her obituary lists the teen as a member of the JROTC. However, her high school mates remember a different, more promiscuous Nadine. It was apparently a well known fact that she was involved in a couple sex scandals at Thurgood Marshall High, resulting in her having to transfer to Raoul Wallenberg Traditional High in early 1999 while still in her freshman year. At this new school, she continued to be proud of her hyper- sexuality, gloating about being sexually active. Nadine was even reportedly caught in the bathroom with several boys. Sometime between 2000 and 2001, the teen moved from her father’s in SF to her mother’s home in Sacramento. 

While living in Sacramento, the teen kept in touch with her SF friends. Allegedly weeks before being found deceased, she reached out to one of those friends to confess that she was working as a prostitute and “hated” it. She would also confide in this friend an even deeper secret: she was being molested by a close family member and had been for years. 

Weeks after the teens brutally chilling confession, she decided to celebrate her 18th birthday in San Francisco. She had also just graduated high school. While in San Francisco, she intended to visit her father and his family and some of her old friends. On July 2nd 2002 , the same day as her birthday, Nadine headed to San Francisco. Only July 3, she visited her father and phoned an Aunt  and that would be the last time the teen is seen. No missing person report has ever been found to be filed. And days later, the teens body is found stuffed into trash can.

Nadine’s murderer has never been caught and no suspects have been named over the 19 years since her death. Did the teen’s alternative lifestyle play a role in her death? Did she meet someone for a “date”? The are several hotels in the area, could one have been the original crime scene? 

20 years later, no leads and no suspects. Someone knows what happened. A young, beautiful teen, scared by sexual abuse. I can’t imagine what she may have gone through.

Thanks for reading!

The murder of 16 year old Kim Bryant has been solved through DNA testing. 
On Jan. 26, 1979, Bryant was reported missing when she didn’t return home from school. She had gone there to register for classes. The Western High school sophomore was last seen that morning near a Dairy Queen restaurant on Decatur Boulevard near U.S. 95. Her body was found on Feb. 20 in a desert area near Charleston Boulevard and Buffalo Drive.

Police determined that Bryant was abducted, sexually assaulted, and killed. The man responsible was 19 year old Johnny Peterson, who died in 1993. 

The same Texas-based forensic sequencing lab, Othram Inc., that solved the Bryant case also solved another Las Vegas cold case earlier this year involving the 1989 murder of 14-year-old Stephanie Isaacson. The suspect in her case was Darren Marchand. He died by suicide in 1995. His DNA was matched to the Isaacson crime scene and one other murder scene.

Police searching for the bodies of missing Victorian campers Russell Hill and Carol Clay have found human remains in bushland near Dargo, in the state's remote High Country.

Dozens of officers have been scouring a camping ground at the site of a former gold mining town called Grant in Victoria's east, looking for the bodies of the pair.

The campers went missing from their remote Wonangatta Valley campsite in March, 2020.

Last week, Caroline Springs man and former Jetstar pilot Greg Lynn was charged with two counts of murder in relation to their disappearance.

He has been remanded in custody until a court hearing scheduled for May next year, and is yet to enter a plea.

Police said the remains were yet to be identified.

The discovery comes after five unmarked police cars were seen travelling to the remote search site early on Tuesday morning.

Dense shrub and dangerous terrain have made the search difficult.

Police had postponed their investigation over the weekend, with wet weather hindering their efforts.

Clearer weather on Monday aided investigators, and police were seen carting an all-terrain buggy to the search site.

He was 36 and had no known enemies and served on a few local boards.  Was head of Walsh Lumpkin (a company that made things for medical care) and was involved with humco manufacturing, etc.  None made narcotics or had any dealings that were exposed that showed any immoral or illicit dealings.  


I've never heard any reason for his death only a person that may have been involved. Local information is that the device was remotely detonated.  Meaning someone likely targeted him.   He was a young man with a promising career taken from him.  No one has ever seen justice.

She wrapped a scarf or something around her head to keep her hair clean and she was barefoot to avoid her shoes getting splattered. Anything she wrapped around her head could be hidden amongst her menstrual rags. The dress she burned had nothing to do with it, even though it was idiotically stupid to burn it because it made her look more guilty. She is a criminal mastermind, but also really stupid when what she’s doing is truly an innocent act.
2. Murdering the stepmother was planned. Murdering the father was less-planned, though happy to take the opportunity when it arrived. Maybe the father would have been murdered at a later date if no opportunity presented itself on that day.
3. The stepmother was attacked by someone she knew. Hence why Bridget never heard any screams. Even if she was outside washing windows, surely a woman screaming because a total stranger has entered the room would alert her. Which means stepmother was attacked by a face she trusted and wasn’t given enough time to scream. Bridget being outside is the only reason she didn’t hear the body thud to the floor.
4. The “giggle” Bridget hears is probably Lizzie. It could be the dead body releasing gas or gurgling in some way, but Bridget seems to think it is a human voice.
5. Lizzie tries to get Bridget to go fabric shopping to get her to leave the house again. Bridget chooses to lie down on her bed on the 3rd floor. Lizzie didn’t know her father would come home early, but she sees an opportunity. She just has to get Bridget out of the way.
6. Lizzie tells those lies about the stepmother being gone so he doesn’t go looking for her upstairs.
7. The ax or whatever she used was put in the cellar or thrown onto the roof or hidden in plain sight.
8. She wanted the money. Her dad might soon die of old age, and then leave all the money to the wife. There might of been other perceived wrongs or abuses (we have no proof), or she may have just been incredibly angry over her inheritance being passed to someone else. Emma and others may suspect what happened, but as long as they get their inheritance too, they don’t care. They too were angry about the inheritance going to the wife, but they just weren’t as psycho as Lizzie to enact actual murder.
9. Despite how much they harp on about what a good Christian woman she is, we know she was quite the thief. If she can teach Sunday school, but then go out and steal stuff, then that means it’s an act and she doesn’t fully believe in it.
10. Lizzie might have talked thru her plan with the uncle, so he could look for flaws or blind spots in her plan. But I think it was all her and his only job was to have a solid alibi and not be involved.

If it was not Lizzie herself that swung the ax, then she 100% hired someone and let them inside and helped smuggle them out. But it’s harder for me to believe this since as far as we know, no mysterious payments were sent to anyone nor did anyone ever get caught bragging about what they had done etc.       
It’s hard enough for me to believe the uncle was in on it, despite his odd behavior, just because it’s easier to keep a crime secret if you’re the only one who knows what really happened.      
I think Bridget was absolutely terrified and not in on it at all. I think she’s lucky Lizzie didn’t murder her too, which might have happened if Lizzie hadn’t been able to get her to leave the first floor where her father was.      
But I think she wanted to leave Bridget alive so there would be someone there to bear witness to Lizzie being cleanly dressed with no signs of blood.    

I could believe she was just a good Christian woman in the wrong place at the wrong time, it’s certainly happened before *(Lindy Chamberlain),* but we know she was a repeat thief and therefore not a good Christian woman. Plus, all of the strange excuses *(lies)* she had for why she wasn’t there to hear these murders in the house.

She may or may not have tried to purchase poison. That doesn’t really matter to me. What I think stumped them is they couldn’t figure out how she stayed clean of the blood, when it was really her father’s coat that saved her. Going totally naked is too outlandish and unnecessary. She just needed something that could be hidden in plain sight. I think the same for the murder weapon, whatever it was, it was something that could be disposed of quickly or hidden in plain sight.

The three properties of ""significant"" interest, where searches will begin from 9am, are located at Bellevue Hill, Bondi Beach and Potts Point.
Ms Balmain, then aged 22, was last seen in the Kingsford area on November 5, 1994.  

&gt;Her personal property – including a make-up bag, keys and a shoe – was later found scattered near Ainslie Street.
She was reported missing later that evening and hasn't been seen or heard from since.
""We are now exploring a new line of inquiry and believe these locations are of significance and will help us progress the investigation,"" Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Bell said.
A $1 million reward for information about Ms Balmain's disappearance, announced in May, was linked to today's sudden search developments.
""Following the $1 million reward announcement and additional public appeals for information, we are now exploring a number of new lines of inquiry,"" Detective Chief Inspector Bell said.
""This includes whether Revelle was scheduled to meet with any individuals – clients, friends or associates – previously unknown to police, on the evening of her disappearance.""
Despite extensive investigations by local police at the time and over the years, no one has been charged in relation to her disappearance.
Before her disappearance, Ms Balmain had told friends she had fallen in love and was about to embark on a six-week dance tour of Japan.
She was working as a sex worker but November 5, the day she was last seen alive, was meant to be her last shift.
But she wasn't seen again publicly after her agency's driver dropped her at an address in Kingsford.
Ms Balmain's boyfriend at the time reported her missing that night, followed by her mother the next day.
A 1999 coronial inquest found Ms Balmain had died at the hands of a person or persons unknown, and the matter was referred to the Unsolved Homicide Unit for future investigation. ""

I remember seeing Revelle's picture on the missing posters around Sydney train stations back in the 90s.  For some reason I always connected her with Caroline Byrne who died at The Gap in Sydney - Gordon Wood was convicted of her murder but had his conviction quashed later - most people still think he's guilty I would bet.  Anyway I probably only conflated them because they were both models and died or disappeared around the same time.  Revelle was a bit more fringe though as she worked as an escort occasionally and many believe police weren't as thorough for this reason.    
  
I wonder what has brought forth the new interest in this case.  NSW Police have put up a number of $1 million rewards lately and Revelle's case was upgraded to this amount in May this year.  
  
Everything points towards her murder but with no body or clear suspect it remains a long standing Sydney mystery.

876,Academic_Internet,1638218285,"The Vanished Podcast just put out an episode about James today and I was blown away by how weird this case is. There is not a ton of information out there but I encourage you to[listen to the podcast episode](http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/episodes) to get the entire story and all the details. There is frustratingly little info out there. From a news article linked below:

**Chance is described as 6’1” tall, weighing about 175 pounds, with red hair and blue/green eyes.**

**His vehicle was found abandoned at the Arkansas Welcome Center on I-30, just northeast of Texarkana in March.**

**While detectives said there are no signs of foul play, they have exhausted all leads to include having the Welcome Center and area surrounding it searched by K9 teams. Detectives are seeking information from any acquaintances who may have knowledge about his whereabouts.**

The podcast has way more info and the details are weird. James disappeared sometime between January and March 2021, no one is exactly sure of the date. He had some of his bills on autopay because he had a large sum of money from selling a property he owned (I believe it was a second home). Most of Texas was out of electricity during the time he went missing, but his apartment building did not lose power. His landlord let his family know he was missing after he autopaid rent for two months and then stopped paying. 

The podcast episode is interesting because it's clear his family members who are interviewed are in the dark about his life. He did not stay in regular contact with his family and they didn't even know he hadn't had a job in years. IMO it would be very likely he had a completely separate life from them that he kept secret. They checked his phone records and the only calls were regular calls to a pizza place, a utilities company, and somewhere else mundane. There were no personal calls to friends or family or text messages at all. In one month he sent 2 text messages, and only 19 the next month before he went missing. 

One thing that made me think he may be living a double life is that a family member (perhaps his mother?) on the podcast was talking about how in the early days of the pandemic he was ""overreacting"" and had rules for going to the grocery store and was ""panicked about COVID"". The family member said he wouldn't come visit them and said they hadn't seen people in two weeks so it shouldn't have been a big deal. They really stressed that he seemed paranoid about COVID but IMO --- this is how everyone I know was behaving in the early days of the pandemic. Most people I know did not see ANYONE for months and wiped down groceries or wore gloves to the grocery store, and there were several months where it felt absurd to even consider traveling to see family especially pre-vaccine, so I don't think his actions here show that he was being paranoid - instead, I think it demonstrates the incongruencies between his beliefs and his family's.

When you look at the some of the cases you've researched, is there usually some aspect of them that many of them seem to have in common? I'm not talking about cases that you think could have the same perpetrator or suspect. I'm referring more here to specific types of cases.

I tend to be drawn to cases where there's just enough info to be mysterious, but little else. One such case that I've started threads on but got little in the way of responses (presumably due to said lack of info) is the 1983 disappearance of [Grace Esquivel ](https://charleyproject.org/case/graciela-esquivel). A woman leaves her child with her parents overnight to go out with friends. When her parents came back to her house the next morning to drop off the granddaughter, Grace is nowhere to be found despite no signs of a struggle and everything in the house (including her car, keys, and wallet) being intact. Very mysterious, right? And yet outside of Charley Project and a few other sites, there's basically no other information about this case. Not necessarily unheard of for cases in the pre-internet age, but kind of frustrating.  

I also tend to gravitate toward cases from the pre-internet age (often from 70s and 80s). With so much information constantly at our fingertips about more recent cases, I find it sometimes overwhelming  to sort through. I like to be able to read and digest things at my own pace as well as the challenge of researching. I live in central Florida and only about a year ago, started reading a little bit into the Casey Anthony case. Without it being in the media so much, I feel like I can kind of take my time and form my own opinions.

I ran across a court of appeals case dealing with a trust issue, that involved both Shelden and Starchild.

Including a deposition made while Shelden was a fugitive in Europe. 

From the case, I though it was interesting Shelden was permitted to give a deposition while a fugitive:

   *Over the objection of Appellants, on November 24, 1981 Judge Joiner ordered that the deposition be taken de bene esse in the Netherlands at a date and time to be arranged between counsel for the parties. Full opportunity to be present for the deposition was accorded by the district court to counsel for Appellants, but they did not participate.* 

This is Shelden's version of why he fled, and how:

*In July 1976 Shelden received a telephone call from Deyer Grossman who said that a mutual acquaintance by the name of Gerald Richards was having severe ""difficulties"" and that Richards might involve Shelden in these ""difficulties""; and that Shelden might become the subject of blackmail by Richards. Shelden testified that Grossman ""suggested that it might be wise for me to leave the country for awhile . . . to await events."" Shelden said that his immediate concern was protecting his assets, especially his negotiable stocks. He asked Grossman for advice. Grossman suggested that Shelden contact Adam Starchild, an investment counselor specializing in offshore investments. Shelden had never met Starchild but telephoned him in New Jersey and asked for his advice. Starchild recommended that Shelden bring his stock certificates to New Jersey and discuss the matter with him further.*

884,mysteryconfidential,1638200896,"**Where is David Miscavige’s Wife?**

Scientology is one of the most controversial ‘religions’ in the world. This is due in part because of their high-profile celebrity connections, their strange genesis (from the wicked imaginings of a Science Fiction writer — L. Ron Hubbard), their history of ‘shunning’ those that they deem suppressive to the belief system and the reputation of being an expensive religion for their disciples.

Scientology gained a lot of notoriety within their short fifty-year history with films based on their lure (Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master), documentaries about the inner workings of their organisation (Going Clear by Lawrence Wright) and some of the most famous people in the world propping up their public image or former members that are ‘exposing’ the truth behind the religion (actress Leah Remini’s more recent defection).

From their less than humble origins to their status as an official religion in the USA (according to the IRS), and outlawing the religion in countries such as Germany and France — Scientology has been shrouded in mystery, dodgy press and the church has arguably been damaging to many of their celebrities’ reputations (Tom Cruise’s image has certainly taken a hit).

But one mystery that has somewhat been swept under the rug is the disappearance of Shelly Miscavige, wife of the COB (Chairman of the Board) David Miscavige.

David Miscavige is the current leader of the church and has the designation of **“Chairman of the Board”** as well as **“Captain of the Sea Org.”** The Sea-Org was a literal Navy originally commanded by Hubbard himself which sailed the high-seas in the name of Scientology.

David Miscavige is a close personal friend to Tom Cruise. David was an original deputy to the late founder L. Ron Hubbard and had been working in the upper hierarchy of the Church since he was a teenager. David’s rise to the top of the church has been meteoric. From humble beginnings in Pennsylvania (where he maintains a thick Philly accent) to COB for Scientology. Although David’s reign as head of the church has seen the religion unquestionably rise and rise, and despite the numerous controversies Miscavige has been linked to (beatings, imprisonment, bullying, vulgar behaviour towards underlings) — the *real* hot question that remains unanswered as far Mr. Miscavige is concerned is — where is Shelly Miscavige — the leader’s wife.

**Shelly Miscavige**

**Shelly was last seen publicly in August 2007 (some reports state 2006).** 

**Apparently, the week before Shelly’s disappearance, David went ballistic at his wife while she carried out late night administration on behalf of the church. This was the same week that her father died.** 

It was actress Leah Remini that brought the missing spouse to the forefront of public consciousness. Leah Remini is famous for her role as sassy Carrie Heffernan on the extremely popular sitcom the King of Queens. But Leah was also a devout Scientologist during her stint on King of Queens and her recent defection has seen her labelled as an enemy of the church.

Remini spent millions of her own money to fund the church (as well as $300,000 to leave the Church) and Leah had the inside ear of the church during her time within. Remini attended Tom Cruise’s wedding to Katie Holmes in 2006 and it was there that she first noticed that the First Lady of Scientology was not in attendance at the Scientologist’ event of the century. She questioned where Shelly was, as amicably as possible, to David and was dressed down by church officials with the words “you don’t ever ask about Shelly.” Leah was taken to one side and severely remonstrated for asking the question about the missing wife.

***“You do not ask about Shelly!”***

Leah’s break from the church came soon after this incident and this has been extremely acrimonious. In 2013 Remini filed a missing person report for Shelly with the Los Angeles Police Department — which the LAPD decided not to pursue.

Rumour has it that Shelly’s initial transgression (and where the ‘split’ started) was for filling out job applications without David’s knowledge or permission (as reported by The New Yorker’s Lawrence Wright). Shelly was also concerned about David’s cold and hostile behaviour towards her and allegedly had stopped wearing his wedding ring (or so Shelly believed).

Misbehaving Scientologists have been known to allegedly get themselves locked up in “The Hole” — a group of buildings where people are held ‘captive’.

**Scientology denies the existence of any holes.**

Since her lack of whereabouts there has been rampant speculation and intrigue into where exactly Shelly is. David Miscavige’s own father Ron Miscavige gave an interview to Australia’s Sixty Minutes in 2019 where he was quoted as saying the following:

***“Shelly*****,** ***she’ll never be free… I know it’s difficult to believe, but the worst thing about this is that I’m telling you the truth… they don’t have a conscious and that lets them do it…”***

When asked if she believed Shelly to be alive a stone-faced Leah Remini said:

***“I hope so.”***

Ron Miscavige left the church in 2012 and was subsequently shunned by his own son David since his departure. This is a common act in Scientology. Those that wish to leave the church will be deemed a ‘Suppressive Person’ by those within the church and all contact must cease immediately. This of course is a common trait of many “destructive cults”. The philosophy that — those that are not with us will therefore be deemed as against us. David has shunned his own father. And the rumour mill believes that Shelly has been forced away from both the church and the public eye in the same way David did to his own father Ron. Thereby Shelly is deemed a SP (a Suppressive Person).

The LAPD police have stated they will not pursue any missing persons enquiries into her disappearance deeming the missing persons report is “unfounded.”

**The Hole**

“There was no end” — Mike Rinder on the Hole.

The Hole is an unofficial nickname for the Scientology Gold Base. Located in the town of Hemet in Riverside County, California. It is two double wide trailers joined together with bars on the windows and guards on the door.

Mike Rinder (former international spokesperson of the church) was ‘imprisoned’ in the Hole for two years. Rinder claims that he was beaten by David Miscavige *many many* times. Rinder also claims that he has witnessed beatings from Miscavige hundreds of times. Mike Rinder was sent to the hole under the pretext of lengthy reflection.

The purpose of the Hole (which the church denies is a prison) was an intended place of both reflection and ‘figuring’ it out for residents. However, the claim is that the Hole is a prison and many people have been subject to imprisonment for over a decade. The Hole could very well be hiding the former Queen of Scientology — Shelly Miscavige.

In July 2012 the speculation was finally addressed by the Church where they wrote a letter to two UK newspapers stated that Shelly is fine and devotes most of her time to the church and cannot be deemed as “missing.”

**A Match Made in Xenu**

The Miscaviges — Reincarnated South American revolutionaries and now modern day Religious leaders.

When David married Shelly in December 1982, Shelly viewed Miscavige as the reincarnation of Simon Bolivar. While Shelly herself viewed herself as Manuela Sáenz. The pedestal of which they placed themselves was a very strange and yet, very large one.

Shelly had been within the church since the age of 12. Supportive of her husband’s rapid rise within the Church, Shelly’s own mother had died in 1985 from three rifle shots to the check and a superficial slash mark on her wrists — the death was deemed a suicide. A former Scientologist remarked to hear David Miscavige state that ‘the bitch got what she deserved’ when he mentioned his Mother-in-Law’s death.

The fall-out of Shelly’s mother’s unusual death and the preceding divorce from the church did not affect her status during this period. Shelly was closely involved in the Church’s relationship with the Church’s highest profile member, Tom Cruise.

Shelly helped audit (think Catholic confessional) Penelope Cruz when she first entered the Church of Scientology during her relationship with Tom Cruise. Shelly was involved in the Purification Rundown program endorsed by the church. After the Cruise-Cruz breakup Shelly was allegedly heavily involved in the pursuit to find Tom Cruise a new partner (which eventually lead to his relationship with Katie Holmes).

Shelly’s role within the Church was clearly not pedestrian. She was (or still is…) an active member with high profile relationships and rigorous programmes within Scientology.

**So, where is Shelly?**

Shelly had spent her whole life conveying orders and gathering intelligence for her husband. She and David had a respectful relationship towards one another in public. In the eyes of other Sea Org members Shelly was brittle and imperious. However; she was also one of the only members that openly challenged David Miscavige’s physical assaults against Scientology members. She may have strayed just a bit too close to the sun in challenging her husband.

***“She’ll be out of sight and out of mind until the day she dies.”***

***A former Scientology member.***

There’s very little concrete to go on beyond rampant speculation (and we all want to avoid any slander suits from the church). However, what we do know is that Scientology has (rightly or wrongly) been labelled a cult with a history of purging those that they deem to be enemies.

We know that allegations have been made that David Miscavige is a violent bully with further allegations of humiliating and degrading behaviour towards those beneath Mr. Miscavige. He is not adverse to violence, intimidation and ‘shutting people away’.

We know that a pseudo prison is operating in California and that members are given lengthy periods of ‘reflection.’ We know that David Miscavige’s wife has not (or barely) been seen since 2007 and we know that, despite LAPD’s lack of interest in the case, there have been demands by Miscavige’s own family to know where Shelly Miscavige is.

She is more than likely still alive. But what kind of life would that be if you are being heavily suppressed by a destructive cult. A morbidly punishing life.

Wherever she is… we should all wish her well.

890,AckReik03,1638169681,"Nearly 30 years after a serial killer terrorized the Midwest, and just days after multiple police agencies and the FBI launched a task force to re-examine the cold case, News 4 has learned there may be a dramatic development unfolding.

Multiple sources close to the investigation tell News 4 they are closely looking at a convenience store homicide in Terre Haute in 2001, nearly 10 years after the I-70 killing spree ended.  Terre Haute, along with Indianapolis, Raytown, Wichita, and here in St. Charles were the sight of random homicide scenes along interstate 70 in 1992.

Tuesday morning, Terre Haute police sergeant Troy Davis confirmed to News 4 there are similarities between the 2001 homicide, and the I-70 homicides.  Davis said investigators have identified a person of interest in the 2001 case. That person is not in custody.

Investigators emphasize they are looking at each case separately before drawing any conclusions at this point.

The 2001 case was a convenience store robbery, where the killer shot and killed clerk Billy Brossman. The shooting occurred just seven blocks from Terre Haute's 1992 homicide scene. Now, according to multiple sources involved in the task force, the Brossman case was discussed at length behind closed doors to see if the suspect could be tied to the I-70 killings.

Investigators are cautious to publicly make any connection between the cases at this point.  But another police source told News 4 he is confident the person who killed Brossman is definitely a suspect as the I-70 serial killer.

Police have long speculated as to why, after killing six people in one month in 1992, the killer suddenly stopped. If the Brossman case can be connected, then he clearly did not.

892,mkultra5252,1638155511,"In 1973, Wanda Deann Kirkum was born in Steuben County in New York, and grew up in the rural towns of Hornell and Pavilion. 

In June 2020, police identified Wanda as Valentine Jane Doe, whose body was found on February 15, 1991 in the Florida Keys.

Wanda had a difficult, isolated childhood, and was allegedly abused by her parents, who are both now deceased. By all accounts, Wanda did not have much contact with any extended family, leaving her largely cut off from the outside world. According to Wanda’s cousin Brenda, “I was the only cousin who would play with her and spend the night. I didn’t see much of her. She kept to herself and when her parents would come to my house, she would stay in the car with her mother.”

In keeping with trends at the time, Wanda wore her brown hair in a shaggy mullet and had multiple piercings in both ears. Her life in upstate New York likely felt claustrophobic and bleak— the region is characterized by small farm towns and brutal winters that probably left her daydreaming about sunny, warm beaches far from the abuse and neglect she endured at home.

When she was sixteen, Wanda decided she couldn’t take any more abuse from her parents, and she ran away from home. In a clear sign of their care for their daughter, Wanda’s parents never reported her missing or attempted to find her. According to her extended family, they believed that Wanda had decided to start a new life, but they had drifted away from her and her parents by this point and never suspected she had met foul play.

Details of Wanda’s life from here are scant, although it’s likely she spent a couple of years hitchhiking around the east coast, eventually ending up in southern Florida. With its white, sandy beaches, warm breezes, towering palm trees, and lively, diverse cities, nearby areas like Miami and the Florida Keys must have seemed like a paradise straight out of her childhood dreams. However, investigators do not believe she had been in the state long at the time of her death, as she had no tan lines and was found wearing clothes more suitable for cooler weather.

At some point, Wanda got two tattoos: a heart with the word “Love” in it on her left shoulder, and a tiny cross with sun rays emanating from it near her left thumb. Perhaps these tattoos signified what Wanda wanted so desperately for her future: a life full of love, brightness, and hope. 

Investigators also suspect that she may have carried a baby to full term due to stretch marks on her stomach, however her family denies that she ever gave birth. At the time of her death, Wanda had ovarian and Fallopian tube cysts and was suffering from salpingitis, an inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, which likely would have caused her a great deal of pain. 

On Valentine’s Day 1991, witnesses reported seeing Wanda hitchhiking out of Key West, traveling northbound on U.S. 1 at Mile Markers 10, 15, and 17. She was last seen still hitchhiking at around 6:30 p.m. on U.S. 1, which is the sole route from the Keys to Miami. 

Early the next morning, windsurfers discovered Wanda’s body off of a dirt road in a recreational area approximately 20 miles from where she was last seen. 

The identity of Wanda’s killer is known, and he himself was murdered less than a year after he took Wanda’s life.

Wanda’s short life was an unfair one, full of hardship and loneliness. By all appearances, Wanda was an incredibly brave girl, unwilling to settle for a life of cruelty when she knew she deserved better. Despite having no money or support, Wanda was determined to make a new life for herself that would bring her happiness and contentment, perhaps for the first time. 

After three decades, Wanda’s body was returned to her remaining family and she has been laid to rest.

Hi everyone I’m trying to look into a certain case but I can’t seem to remember the names involved.

I know that it involves a young woman from New Jersey(?). She was part of a well to do family but met a man much older than her, married him and moved to Oklahoma to live with his parents. She got pregnant and had a baby then went missing. She went on a trip(?) with the family in the days before her disappearance. Her body was found some time later in the woods and suspicion is on the husband and parents even though they’ve never been charged with anything. 

I’ve googled these details multiple different ways but can’t seem to find the right sources. Does anyone know?

One solved this year was the murder of Kaitlyn Arquette. Based on the big fight they had, the note he seemed to have forged, and the timing of the breakup, I was so certain it was her boyfriend!

904,powerpuck,1638108215,"The ""Hickey Theory"" (Mortal Error/Smoking Gun) was proposed years ago by Maryland gunsmith/marksman Howard Donahue and the subject of a book by Bonar Menninger and a video by Colin McClaren.

But in [this newer information](https://mokan9997.medium.com/what-if-hickey-didnt-pull-the-trigger-dd9fae6a664c) by Menninger the earliest versions of the AR15 which Hickey would have been using had a defectively large firing pin which after cocking and loading would hit the bullet and make it accidentally discharge.

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269NiovMgrs) McClaren repeats Donahues assertion that Hickey picked up the gun, flipped off the safety mechanism, put his finger on the triger, and as he swung around to return fire on Oswald, the car lurched and he accidentally fired at JFK. 

But if you look at transcripts of Hickey's statements, he says ""*I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, and turned to the rear.*""  &lt;-- google that to find it on may JFK assassination sites.

So is it plausible that instead of having an AR15 with a round in the chamber and Hickey accidentally pulling the trigger, that instead there was no round on the chamber and he's ""cocking and loading"" the AR15 as he's turning around and the firing pin ""slamfire"" discharges a bullet toward JFK?",UnresolvedMysteries,JFK Dallas -&gt; Hickey theory ... could a faulty AR15 firing pin (slamfire) be the culprit?,0

**Background:**

Fair-haired and blue-eyed, [Christine Vivian Butcher](https://imgur.com/a/6GI852g) was born in April of 1944 in Windsor, a town in Berkshire, England. She was the only daughter of Charles Ernest Butcher (1912 - 1976) and Barbara Eva Butcher (née Quine; 1906 - 1984). She had an older brother named John, who was born in 1939. The family lived on [Peascod Street](https://imgur.com/a/JAN4PvR), near Windsor Castle. From a young age, Christine had an interest in famous people, especially boxers, her favourite of which was the American Sugar Ray Robinson.

**The Disappearance:**

Christine's home was just 30 yards from the [Star and Garter Hotel](https://imgur.com/a/veWRTk5), and on the 8th of July 1951, she found out that Sugar Ray was staying there in preperation for his fight on the 10th against the British middleweight boxer Randy Turpin. Christine had a black porcelain doll she nicknamed 'Blackie' (this was the 1950s!) that she thought looked like Sugar Ray, and she was desparate to show it to him, hoping that the resemblance would impress him so much that he would take her on a ride in his [pink Cadillac](https://imgur.com/a/GWlFlom).

Between 3 and 3:30pm, Christine's mother waved her daughter off as Christine set off on the short walk to the hotel, dressed in a green and white gingham dress and a blue gabardine raincoat and clutching the doll and a small bag of sweets. This would be the last time Christine would be seen alive, and her parents contacted authorities a few hours later (I could not find exactly how long after) when she did not return home when it got dark.

**The Initial Investigation:**

The Berkshire police immediately started their search. It was believed that Christine had reached the entrance of the hotel, 'disappearing' into a crowd of people waiting at the steps, but they found by talking to Sugar Ray that Christine had stepped foot the hotel, as he, anybody in his entourage or any hotel employees had not seen Christine at all. Sniffer dogs and soldiers brought in from the famed Household Cavalry to search the area and draggings of the nearby River Thames also yielded no results.

Christine's connection to Sugar Ray meant that her disappearance was in headlines across the word, the news spreading even to Australia and the USA. Sugar Ray himself was quoted as saying  “I am very sorry about this - if I had known she wanted to see me, her daddy could have brought her in and then this never would have happened.”

However, it would not be until two days later, when attentions had by now turned back to the fight, that the case would get any answers - and unfortunately, they were not happy ones.

**The Discovery:**

On the 10th of July 1951, at dusk, whilst over 18,000 people were travelling to Earls Court to watch Sugar Ray fight Randy Turpin, Christine's body was found in a copse in a meadow near Windsor Castle (a mile away from the hotel) by two members of the public out on a walk. She was found half-dressed, and it was found that she had been raped before sucuumbing to strangulation with the belt of her own raincoat. The porcelain doll and half-eaten bag of sweets that she had been seen with when she set off were found nearby.

It was believed she had been killed on the day that she had disappeared, and exactly where she was found as the pathologist found grass still rooted in the earth was found caught up in the knot of belt used to kill her. 

**Continued Investigation:**

The investigation now ramped up. The police made over 6000 calls to nearby houses were made, and took over 1800 statements - in one, Christine's 15 year-old female friend (?) claimed that she had seen Christine on the 8th, walking with a white man of indeterminate age dressed in a grey suit, and that when she had waved to Christine, the girl had waved back. Furthermore, she said that this man and an 'elderly' man had asked her to sit with her underneath some nearby trees - she declined. Although she said that she would be able to identify this man if she saw him again, her description could not be conclusively matched to anybody. Other witnesses included a coach driver, who said that he had seen Christine (and her doll) watching a sentry in a car park at approximately 4pm, 

The last confirmed sighting of Christine came from a local woman, who saw her at 4:07pm walking behind a group of people down an alley known to locals as 'Drive Slowly Alley' or Death Trap Alley'. It ran down the side of the Star and Garter and was next to the steps that led to the main railway station (it was a shortcut to the River Thames, which runs through Windsor). 

The police also reviewed three donated films that had recorded the masses of people as they waited outside the Star and Garter (one by a local girl, one by Edna Robinson, wife of Sugar Ray and one by a television company). At least one of these films showed Christine among the crowds towards the back, still holding her doll (I'm unsure at what time this was). Whilst this did prove that Christine did make it at least to the hotel's surrounding area, the video did not show where she went after and who with (several people seen near her on the tape were questioned and ruled as suspects).

On the 15th of July, a 're-enactment' of the murder was held by the police in the 45-acre meadow where Christine was found, and whilst over 30,000 people attended, this provided no new leads. 

**Suspects/ Persons of Interest:**

* On the 17th of July, the police made a public appeal for the four adults seen in Death Trap Alley near Christine. They were:

1. A man aged 20 - 25 years-old, 5ft 11in, well-built, wearing a sandy-coloured sports jacket and grey flannel trousers.
2. A woman (with a child).
3. A woman (with a child).
4. A man aged 40 - 45 years-old, 5ft 9in, medium to stocky build, clean shaven.

It was reported that they, at approximately 4pm, they had been discussing the boxing match, with the 20 to 25 year old saying to another ""'I hope Turpin gives him a good hiding."": the other man replied ""Don't worry, he will.""

* The police later announced that they were also searching for a man seen outside Christine's house on the 8th of July. He was hatless, red-faced and approximately 35 years-old.
* Another description of a person of interest was released later in July, possibly of the man above: he was 5ft 10in - 5ft 11in, approximately 35 years-old, with a 'reddish' complexion, fair hair brushed back with a clean shaven face and wearing a plain navy-blue suit but no hat. 

**Aftermath:**

On the 21st of September, the inquest into her death came back with a verdict of 'murder by some person or persons unknown'. 

As the investigation into Christine's case had been unfolding, journalists across the country had been eagerly reporting on it in their papers - and one of these was read by 21 year-old convicted child-rapist [John Thomas Straffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Straffen#Child_killings). Most likely making the connection that murdering (specifically strangling) young girls made massive trouble for the police, Straffen went on in the upcoming weeks and months to kill  5 year-old Brenda Goddard (whose case was initially connected to Christine's) and 9 year-old Cicely Batstone. Although he was soon caught, he actually escaped from Broadmoor Hospital, where he was serving his sentence, in 1952 and killed 5 year-old Linda Bowyer before being recaptured. 

The murder of Christine Butcher remains unsolved today, and her case is currently considered cold.

Police launched a second probe into the death of a Gatineau teenager on Thursday, saying they believe the woman’s body was tampered with after she was killed.

Valerie Leblanc, 18, was found dead on Tuesday in a wooded park behind the Gabrielle-Roy campus of the CEGEP de l’Outaouais, where she was a student. Police are calling the death a homicide.

Four teenagers told police they were walking through the park on Tuesday afternoon when they saw smoke rising from an off-trail area. They went to investigate, and discovered Leblanc’s body with evidence of burns and other signs of violence.

The teens later told police that they did not realize the body was real, so they returned to class. Eventually they decided something was wrong and phoned police.

The killing, Gatineau’s first homicide this year, has rocked the community, says Mariane Leduc, a communications officer with the Gatineau police.

“The (school) is in a very quiet neighbourhood. It’s a good neighbourhood. So of course people are shocked and the students are shocked as well,” she said. “It’s very hard on everyone.”

Media outlets have reported that Leblanc and her boyfriend had recently broken up, and that they were seen entering the woods together. But police, while confirming the split between the couple, have said that investigators met with the boyfriend and that he is not considered a suspect.

Since Tuesday, police have sectioned off a huge swath of the park and as of Thursday night were still searching the crime scene. An autopsy report is expected tomorrow.

On Thursday, police launched a parallel investigation to the homicide probe, saying they believe Leblanc’s body was tampered with after her death. They are investigating charges of obstructing justice and causing an indignity to a body.

Officers have identified suspects in the second investigation, but no charges have been laid.

Investigators do not believe that the suspects of the second probe are also Leblanc’s killers. “The people who tampered with the body are not responsible for the death of Valerie,” said Leduc.

Leblanc had just begun her first year of studies at the college, according to police. A vigil in her honour was held Wednesday night.

910,Quirky-Motor,1638036344,"In honor of Native American Heritage Day, I wanted to share a collection of stories involving missing or murdered Native American and other indigenous American people. If you follow the stories of missing people you probably know that there is a epidemic of missing Native American people, so I wanted to share a few of their stories on this very important day. The following pieces were mostly written by myself, but please feel free to add other cases you know of in the comments below.

Bryce Herda, a 7 year old Makah boy disappeared while with a group of relatives at the beach. A local criminal, a nearby homeless encampment, and a sneaker wave have all been looked at as potential culprits. His story can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/g5unfg/a_missing_child_a_nationwide_problem_and_a_serial/)

Teekah Lewis, a two year old girl of Chippewa, African American, and Caucasian descent went missing from a bowling alley in Tacoma, Washington. She was abducted but has never been found. Her story can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/fm3yhc/timeline_and_lengthy_write_up_of_the_teekah_lewis/).

Helen Doe, an unidentified woman of Native American or Hispanic descent, died in a fiery car crash near Kalama, Washington in 1991. The Washington state patrol is still trying to find her identity.  In this piece I profiled about 20 women who could be Helen Doe. This story as well as possible matches, can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/lo154i/extensive_write_up_on_the_bizarre_case_of_helen/)

Over 50 people are missing from the Yakama Indian Reservation. A long form write up on 30 women missing from the Yakama Nation as well as a similar write up on missing men can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/htvnv6/extensive_write_up_on_missing_and_murdered/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/l36nnm/gary_leon_ridgway_confessed_to_71_murders_but_was/) These pieces may be out of date. For example some John Does on the reservation were recently identified as men who were previosuly missing. And some people who previously had no Charley Project or Doe Network pages, now do, so keep that in mind as you read.

My write ups on Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, can be found [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/gpbcll/what_everyone_has_wrong_about_ridgway_extensive/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/gpbiav/what_everyone_has_wrong_about_ridgway_extensive/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/l36nnm/gary_leon_ridgway_confessed_to_71_murders_but_was/) Several victims of Ridgway were Native American such as Carol Chistensen who was of blackfoot descent, Kimi Kai Pitsor who was Native Hawaiian descent, and Patricia Yellow Robe who was from the Rocky Boys Indian reservation in Montana. Contrary to popular belief, The Green River investigation is still active.

Carlota Sanchez, 12, and Elsie Luscier, 13, were cousins who went missing in 1979 from the Quinault Indian reservation. I am currently working on a piece regarding their cases so stay tuned.

Courtney Holden, a 26 year old mother, was last seen in 2018 but wasn't reported missing until 2019. Her adoptive brother is a suspect in her case but he has not been charged with homicide.

911,Benend91,1638033085,"Hi everyone,


Hopefully this case is allowed on this subreddit. I know it's UFO-focused but it's grounded in some actual evidence. Also as somebody who lives 10 miles away from the scene and had never heard about it, I wondered whether it had been discussed much before. A search through Reddit only produces a handful of results and none on this forum.


**What is the Pentyrch Incident?**

The Pentyrch Incident is an alleged UFO sighting that happened in a small village outside of Cardiff, Wales in 2016.


**What allegedly happened?**

Multiple witnesses reported a loud apache-type helicopter flying over the area, multiple unusual lights in the sky and a large explosion at around 4am. Social media posts and phone calls to local police provide a wide array of people who experienced this phenomenon.

A local woman, Caz Clarke, went further and claims to have seen a triangular UFO being chased around the sky by multiple military planes. On the next day, at the end of a field, a large patch of grass and bush was left completely dead and with abnormal levels of radiation. And in the following weeks army personnel were seen at the site, claiming to be there for a routine training operation.


**Why is this a mystery worth exploring?**

Through testimonials from multiple witnesses and seismology reports at the time, there *was* an unusual disturbance that evening. 

Intriguingly the RAF do not deny their presence there and they claim that the lights/sounds and explosion were all part of a routine op. Many people have tried to gain more information about the op using the Freedom of Information act but this has been blocked as the information is deemed to be important for national security.

Also, although there is a MOD site at nearby St Athan, locals are familiar with the sounds of the smaller aircraft and all have said that this was unlike anything they've experienced.


I'm not a UFO conspiracist and I would usually find a way to pick holes in a story like this but Caz Clarke is very convincing. In addition to the actual physical evidence in the surrounding area, it seems something DID happen that evening. 

Was it a training drill? Perhaps it went wrong and that's why the aircraft were flying so low? Or was it something else?

912,appeltreeingarden,1638021697,"Chloie Leverette and Gage Daniel lived with their maternal grandparents in a house in Unionville, TN. They had a pet dog and bird. On September 23rd, 2012, the house the children lived in caught on fire. The remains of Leon and Molli McClaran were discovered deceased inside the house. The dog and the bird were also found dead. However, no trace of either Chloie or Gage was found. The police who investigated the scene believe that the children died in the fire, but forensic anthropologist say that nothing points towards that. Some remains of the children should have been discovered if they had died in the house. Inorder for the children's remains to have been cremated, the fire would have had to reach over 1500 degrees. It's very unlikely that the fire reached that temperature, according to fire experts.

The fire has been declared accidental, but the exact cause is not known. There were over 30 propane tanks in the basement, and authorities say some of the tanks had ruptured. However, there's no sign of explosion.

In 2013, a witness saw a young girl who looked like Chloie at a restaurant. The witness took a photo of the girl, and Chloies mother is sure that the girl in the photo is her daughter. The authorities were not able to determine the identity of the girl in the photo.

914,SleepawayCamp,1638016335,"""Theresa resided with her family in Fresno, California in 1987. She was last seen at 7:20 p.m. on June 1, 1987, while on a camping trip with Russell Welch in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Theresa and Welch,  whose nickname is Skip, camped in the area of Shuteye Peak, approximately 25 miles northeast of Bass Lake. He was 43 years old at  the time. They were reportedly searching for the legendary creature  known as Sasquatch or Bigfoot. Welch considered himself a ""student"" of the legend. Theresa disappeared during the trip and has never been heard from again.

Authorities questioned Welch when he returned to Fresno several days  later. He initially claimed that Theresa ran away from him on June 1,  then he changed his story. Welch eventually stated that Theresa had been  forcibly taken by Bigfoot.

Welch was charged with child stealing. In September 1987, only three  days before he was supposed to go to trial, authorities dropped the  charge. They had offered to recommend a one-year sentence if Welch  signed a waiver allowing them to go forward with murder charges if  Theresa's body were located, but Welch refused. The prosecution decided  to drop the case to avoid double jeopardy if they wanted to charge him  with murder later.

Searches of the Shuteye Peak area produced no clues as to Theresa's  whereabouts, but foul play is suspected in her case. It remains  unsolved."" [Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/theresa-ann-bier)

Many of you are thinking why would a parent/s allow their under age daughter to go camping with a middle-aged man? According to this lengthy, but very informative article, Theresa and her sister didn't have the best home life. A few years back, I read a comment left under a article on Theresa that stated she was her twin sister. This could be Vicki who is referenced below. I cannot find this page, so take that with a grain of salt. This case is ice cold and all involved failed this young lady.

""Theresa was born on April 16, 1971 to Shirley and David Bier. Shirley had a mental illness and David had been in the Vietnam War. When Theresa was about three years old, she was severely injured, ending up in the hospital. Shirley wrapped Theresa’s leg around the crib slats and twisted until it broke. She also beat Theresa, breaking several ribs.  At this point, Social Services intervened and took Theresa and her sisters away. This was also when Theresa's parents split up. Theresa was placed foster care and Sylvia Pierce, a friend from church, took in Theresa and her sister Vicki. Theresa lived happily with Sylvia for a few years, until her father wanted her back.

David had  married Margie Richmond, who had daughters of her own and had once been  married to Shirley’s half-brother, John Richmond. David petitioned the court to get his little girls back and was awarded custody. Theresa and Vicki became reunited with their father, moving to Southern California where both he and Margie worked as janitors. Allegedly, Margie would lock her refrigerator and just sit there and eat her lunch and not feed her kids anything.

Theresa eventually returned to Fresno and stayed with her great-grandmother for a little while with Theresa’s uncle, John Richmond, who also lived in Fresno. He was well known to Fresno law enforcement. Cops knew him as “*Blind Johnny.”* He fenced stolen property. And he actively began to pursued custody of his niece. John had two young sons when he took in Theresa. His new wife and presumably the mother of these young sons was reportedly a prostitute. He also had  a 17-year-old girlfriend, Tammy, who often stayed over at his place.

Theresa became very, very withdrawn. She  would stay in her room and keep to herself. Johnny would make Theresa babysit his little boys, often causing her to miss school. They lived in a filthy apartment. At one point Johnny’s wife took Theresa to Southern  California with the boys where she turned tricks while Theresa watched the kids. Johnny began molesting and raping Theresa and would let his friends do the same.

In June 1987, Theresa had nearly completed her freshman year at Central High in northwest Fresno. At  age  16 she was a year or more older than most of her classmates. Teachers saw Theresa as slow and immature and was placed in special education classes. 

A man named Russell *“Skip”* Welch  pretended to take Theresa to school, but both Skip and Theresa had other plans. They decided to go on a camping trip in the Sierra Nevada mountains and look for[ ](http://darkmatter69.blogspot.com/2018/06/things-you-need-to-know-about-big-foot.html)Bigfoot around the Bass Lake area.

Skip was a 43 years old meth addict. He was obsessed with Bigfoot and would often take girls into the  mountains. Before Theresa went on the camping trip with Skip, Skip had taken a young girl named Michelle on a previous trip. She was warned by friends not to go with him, but she did anyway. Michelle was smart enough to bring two big male friends with her. It's a good thing too,  because Michelle thinks she was drugged. She was screaming that someone  was going to kill her and almost fell off a cliff, but one of her friends saved her.

By mid-morning, the school called Johnny  to inform him that Theresa was not at school. He told them she was home sick. He would later explain that he lied because he preferred to handle the matter on his own.

Before they headed to the mountains, Skip and Theresa made a stop at his daughter, Chandra Welch's, place. Skip was having trouble with his beat-up, 1976 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. 

At 9:30 p.m., when Theresa still wasn't home, John finally called the Fresno police to report her missing.

On Friday, June 5th, Skip’s car was spotted parked by a trailer park near the town of North Fork, a small  foothills community that serves as a kind of gateway to the Shuteye Peak region of Sierra National Forest. Skip had driven down from the mountains to the residence of his friend, Dorothy Davis, who lived right behind that trailer park. Days later, Dorothy told authorities that Skip was extremely upset and possibly high on something when he showed up. He told her about a girl that he had left up in the mountains. A satanic group had gotten control of the girl and had physically changed into something all *“white looking.”*

A week after Theresa was reported missing, John received a threatening phone call from a young female. She  told him that Skip was packing a pistol and wanted her to tell him *“if you continue to make trouble for him, you will have more trouble from him, even your kids can get hurt.* And *“tell the police that Skip had taken Theresa to school, dropped her off, and some unknown blond girl had picked Theresa up.”*

Two days later, Skip was picked up by police at his mother's house in the Sunnyside neighborhood of Fresno. He claimed that he had dropped Theresa off at school, but the police weren't buying it and he was arrested. 

Back at the police station, Skip claimed that Theresa ran away from him on June 1st, but eventually  stated that Theresa had been forcibly taken by Bigfoot. He said that  she would be happier there, because they were super intelligent  beings... 

Skip agreed to show authorities where the campsite that he and Theresa allegedly stayed at. He led them to a small grove of trees at the meadow’s edge along Brown's Creek. At the inner area of this grove there was a smoldering fire among the heavy layer of pine needles that appeared to be somewhat damp. This smoldering burnt area was approximately 3½ feet wide by 8 feet long.  There were these blankets that were put up, and they were in a certain formation. There was a camera, a purse, a off-white bra and a T-shirt,  pictures of the  countryside, along with a picture of Welch playing guitar as he was sitting by what appeared to be the blanket that was in the grove area. There were also pictures of Theresa.

The campsite where all this was found,  turned out to be staged by Skip. From the topography in the photos, the local deputies were able to guess that the actual camp was 20 miles away, possibly in Ghost Canyon. Even though he allegedly lied about the campsite, both the meadow and the Canyon were searched.

A helicopter that was searching for any clue or sign of Theresa's whereabouts spotted something on the hillside above the Brown’s Creek camp. It turned out to be a blue shirt that belonged to Skip and it had meth in the pocket.

One of Skip's relatives told authorities that Skip had told them about a rock at Ghost Canyon where a girl needed to be tied up as a sacrifice to the devil....

Skip was charged with Theresa's abduction, but the case against him was dismissed due to a lack of evidence in October 1987. He was also offered a deal for an extremely light sentence, if he were to confess and show them wear her body was. He refused, sticking to his Bigfoot story.

Searches of the Shuteye Peak area produced no clues as to her whereabouts.

**Theresa has never been found. Foul play is suspected in her case.**

Theresa  was 5'5 ft tall and 110 lbs at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans and laced sandals. She had brown hair, hazel eyes. Theresa's upper front teeth protrude. She has a  surgical scar on her lower right leg due to a childhood fracture. Her nickname is Sam.

In March 1998, Skip died at age 54, from severe coronary artery disease.""

In 2001 Canadian hiker coming to an area of New Hampshire where she often hiked. She arrived late in the day, around 3pm. And thought she would get in a short hike before sunset. 

She had reserved a room at the Appalachian Mountain Club Joe Dodge Lodge in Pinkham Notch, New Hampshire. When she arrived, she asked an AMC worker at the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center where she could take a short hike that would get her back before dusk. 

The clerk suggested a short walk around Lost Pond Trail, which began right across the street from the lodge. She never returned to the lodge.

920,SnoopyDog21109,1637982245,"Edward and Stephania Andrews lived in the affluent Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights. Edward was a semi-retired manager and bookkeeper at Miller-Peerless Mfg. Stephania was a credit investigator for Local Loan Co. They were both aged 62 and had plans to retire at the end of 1970. This marriage was not the first for either Edward or Stephania. Although they had no children together, Edward had two children that he adopted with a former spouse.

The couple attended a cocktail party at the Sheraton-Chicago Hotel in Chicago, IL on May 15, 1970.  The party was sponsored by the Women's Auxiliary of the Beverage Institute, of which Stephania was a member. They arrived at the party between 5:30 and 6 p.m., and left around 9:30 p.m., taking an elevator to the hotel garage. Edward reportedly had been complaining that he felt ill and was hungry (the party had appetizers, but no meal). Friends that had lunch with Edward earlier that day said that he turned pale during lunch and couldn't eat. Was he suffering from some medical condition as early as lunchtime?

The last person to see the couple was Anthony Morelli, the parking manager for the hotel. He claimed that Edward was staggering when he walked to his car and that he hit the garage exit door while attempting to exit the garage. Morelli told Edward that he shouldn't be driving. A tearful Stephania agreed with him. Edward refused to listen and drove away in their black and yellow 1969 Oldsmobile sports coupe with the Illinois license plate number BB9986. They turned out of the hotel garage onto lower Michigan Ave. There are differing accounts of Edward either turning north into the southbound lane, or south into the northbound lane when he exited the parking garage.

The party was on a Friday. The couple wasn't reported missing until the following Monday when co-workers were concerned that Edward and Stephania hadn't shown up to their respective jobs. A neighbor who had a key to their home let the police in to search the house. Everything appeared orderly and there were no signs of foul play. Their clothes and suitcases seemed to all still be in the house.

Investigators theorized that Edward turned the wrong way into oncoming traffic when he left the hotel parking garage, and tried to make a U-turn when he realized that he was going the wrong way. The Chicago River had an area close to the hotel that wasn't protected by a guard rail. Police believe that Edward and Stephania's car plunged into the river. They found a place on a bridge on Lower Wacker Drive where there were scrapes on a concrete pillar and skid marks on the road. Numerous searches of the river have been made. Although other vehicles have turned up during the searches, the Andrews' Oldsmobile has not been located. 

In 1994, Lake County law enforcement received a tip that Edward and Stephania were killed and buried with their car in a pond near Green Oaks. The crime was supposedly committed by a gang known as the Lake Forest Losers. A Knollwood man came forward with a story that when he was 12 or 13, he witnessed the Losers dump a car with the Andrews' bodies in the trunk in a retention pond south of Atkinson Road and east of the Tri-State Tollway near Green Oaks. A search of the pond failed to turn up any additional evidence of what happened to Edward and Stephania. 

The most obvious solution seems to be that Edward drank too much at the party and/or had a medical incident, took a wrong turn when exiting the parking garage, and ended up plunging the car into the Chicago River. Law enforcement has dragged the river several times. During a search of the river in 1980, twelve cars were located, but none were the missing Oldsmobile. Where did the couple disappear to on that fateful spring night?

He was reported to be a well-known and well-liked young man who had grown up in Moston. He attended the North Manchester School for Boys and was a huge fan of his football team: Manchester United. He stood at 5'5"" (1.65m) tall, roughly medium build, and had ginger hair with brown eyes. 

On August 31, 2008, Jordan was with his Aunt Kimberley Pierce. Jordan had lived with his aunt since he was only 20 months old, but things were changing at his Aunt's home. Pierce was in the process of moving Jordan's grandfather into their home, as he had recently become ill and required a caregiver. Pierce was to be that caregiver.  Jordan had planned to spend some time at a hostel in Manchester while his aunt cared for his grandfather. The [Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/jordan-ratcliffe-missing-police-search-15094325) reports, ""\[I\] think he was a bit of a troubled teenager who had gone to stay in this hostel because his grandad was not in good health with all of the intentions of moving back home."" 

At about 16:45 that evening, his aunt and her boyfriend dropped Jordan off in Tib Street in the Northern Quarter. He wore a black and grey jacket, black Nike tracksuit bottoms, and black trainers (tennis shoes). Jordan was traveling light; he only had a small black rucksack, a package of crisps, and £5 in cash. 

""Call me when you get yourself settled,"" Aunt Kimberly Pierce had said as he exited the vehicle.  

Jordan waved goodbye to his aunt with a smile, heading in the direction of the hostel he was to stay at, Men's Direct Hostel in Longsight. He never arrived. 

Because Pierce had not expected to hear from Jordan immediately, she didn't panic when she failed to hear from him that evening. Days passed without word, and by September 8th, the family had notified Manchester Police of the missing teen. 

Julie Potts of the Greater Manchester Police's Missing Person Unit has been working on the case since its initial report. In the decades since Jordan's disappearance, Potts has carried out numerous checks to try and trace the teen. [She states](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/jordan-ratcliffe-missing-10-years-15091374), ""He has been gone for ten years and I will guess everyone knows that. The £20,000 reward is still out there. But there are no other lines of inquiry and Kimberly knows that well. She just wants Jordan to know that if he wants to come home then he can come home."" He could not be spotted on CCTV within the city center because of the gap between his last sighting on Tib Street and when he was reported missing. 

In 2010, a British Transport Police PSCO stopped a young man that matched Jordan's appearance in Waterloo Station. Before letting the person go, the young man told the officer that he was from Manchester. This sighting would generate many inquiries in the London area amid concerns that Jordan was perhaps homeless and living in the area. 

In 2012, Jordan was reportedly sighted in Liverpool, which was later discounted by police. In 2014, there were more reported sightings of Jordan in Portsmouth. Police visited the area, and although initial optimism was held by the force, the team was unable to find anything further. Then, in April 2017, the Piccadilly Basin was drained as part of the hunt for Jordan. The North West Police Underwater Search and Marine Unit searched the canal shallows but found no evidence of Jordan. 

As of writing this, there have been no further discoveries or movement on Jordan Ratcliffe's case. Jordan's aunt has never moved from her house in hopes that if he were to return, he would know where she is. Best said by his aunt, Kimberly Pierce, ""Sometimes the smallest fragment of information can lead to important new lines of inquiry. As the years pass, memories fade. But we will never forget Jordan or give up the search for him.""

923,Environmental_War_62,1637958408,"Hi, a few weeks ago I posted a local case that got some attention, so I decided to also share this one. This is a more recent mystery that I have always found disturbing, so here it goes. This also takes place in Quito, Ecuador's capital. The case is somewhat convoluted, I made my best to break it into parts. 

**David Romo**

David Romo was a 21 year old student, he lived with his mother Alexandra Córdova (his parents are divorced) and attended Universidad Central, he was studying social communication. David is described as a very sensitive and friendly person.  

**Thursday 16, 2013**

According to everyone in his life, friends, classmates, teachers and family, this was a seemingly normal day for David and he behaved as usual, there was nothing off about him that day. He went to University, after classes he hanged out with some friends, had some drinks with them and then headed home. As always, he took a bus. 

**The call** 

At around 22:22 p.m David called his mother, now this wasn't unusual, since he would always let her know when he was getting close to the station and she would pick him up. However, on this occasion, Alexandra claims her son sounded anxious and was speaking in a very low voice, almost whispering. He told her  that there were two men with him in the bus, he said they looked like cops and that they wanted to take him off the bus, he didn't elaborate much more. The last thing David said to her was: ''We're getting close.'', then he hang up. Worried, Alexandra went to the station as soon as she could and waited for him, but David never arrived. The family contacted his friends and girlfriend but none had heard from him since that night. His mother then reported him as missing. 

**The investigation**

The initial investigation managed to identify the exact bus David took that night and focused on three main suspects: the bus driver, the bus counter (the person in charge of collecting the bus fee) and the bus counter's assistant. When questioned about that night, each suspect gave a different version. One claimed David was asleep, that they woke him up and he got off, other that David was never asleep and got off at a different bus stop. After some research, the police found David's cellphone in the bus counter's bother's house, when questioned, this man, referred as Edgar M., said he had ''found'' the cellphone in the bus and gave it to his brother. Edgar M. was then convicted for theft and served one year in prison. In all the articles I read, there is no mention as whether any of these men ever mentioned the two supposed cops. I didn't find any reference to there being any more passengers that night either. Searches were carried out in the areas near the bus route but they came up empty. 

**The Union and Hope ''Clinic''**  

In November of that same year the police raided a clandestine clinic in Pisulí. I'm not very familiar with that part of town, but apparently the area was part of the route the bus was supposed to follow the night David disappeared. Anyways, police said they had received a tip, saying David Romo was or had been in that ''clinic''. This place operated as some kind of rehabilitation center for alcohol and drugs addicts as well as a camal (a place where animals are killed and cut up, more or less like a butcher shop). Seventeen people were being held there and many claimed they were electrocuted, starved and forced to work in the camal as a form of ''therapy''. One person, named Juan Francsico E.  claimed to have seen David inside the clinic. The clinic's owners, Carlos Lodoño, his wife Blanca, a colombian man named Arvey Acevedo (a.k.a Jaleo) and at least two other people were arrested in connection to the disappearance of David but also faced charges related to human trafficking and other offences. One news article mentions that ''a female worker for the justice system'' with ties to the ''clinic'' had also been apprehended but I couldn't find more details about this person. 

Based on Juan Francisco's testimony, those five people were charged with David's murder. According to Juan Francisco and the prosecution, David was brought to the clinic, during a search some drugs were found under his bed, he was then beat up and Jaleo killed with an axe. His body then was dismembered and burned with a blowtorch until there was nothing left. However, it is worth mentioning that Juan Francisco has changed his story multiple times, at first he said he had seen David but didn't mention any murder and at some point even recanted all of what he had said. Besides his testimony, no physical evidence linking David and the ''clinic'' has been found. On August 23, 2018 all the defendants were acquitted from the charges relating to David Romo. Jaleo, however, was convicted for the murder of one of the ''clinic's'' ''patients'' and received 22 years. In 2017, it was reported police members from the police unit in Pisulí were being investigated, allegedly they were aware of the ''clinics'' existence, its activities but didn't take action.  I couldn't find what the result of this investigation was. 

As of today, the case is considered open and has been assigned a new prosecutor. This prosecutor ordered new searches in April of this year, but again, nothing was found and Alexandra complained these searches were carried out in the same areas the first investigation had looked into. 

**Aftermath** 

Alexandra Córdova funded the David Romo Foundation, which is aimed to provide support and resources to the family of missing people. She also has a twitter account where she constantly posts about any update about her son's case. Since the beginning, Alexandra has complained about police's work, citing the fact that they have never tried to track down David's last call. She has said she believes police is somehow involved in David's disappearance, when she and her lawyer requested the initial prosecutor and detectives be investigated, the judge looking into this petition received some threatening messages. Finally, she says she doesn't believe Juan Francisco's story, saying her son never had any issues with drugs. 

The identity of the two mysterious men David claimed to see in the bus that day have never been discovered. I personally find it very odd, if they were cops, what were they doing in a bus? Anyways, this is the case that made me wary of taking a bus late and hope you find it interesting.

Does anyone have any theories? I don’t really want to believe the one where he didn’t survive the jump- that’s no fun. Plus, i dont believe that they wouldn’t have found clues there. I think he must have been really amazing at organizing the heist and he just happened to get away.

On a side note, it’s kind of funny to see all the people who claim they’re DB Cooper. Ppl want to claim that they’re him for publicity I guess, but it doesn’t really make that much sense as to why they would say it lol.

Her thigh bone was already found in July 2020 by a forest worker in a forest near Kipfenberg (near Nuremberg, opposite direction of her hometown) in Bavaria, Germany. Thanks to DNA testing it was confirmed that it was a missing woman from Germany. Police keeps searching the area for more bones. 
The motorway that goes from Munich to Nuremberg is only 1.5km away. 
Sonja Engelbrecht from the city of Laim (south of Munich) went missing on April 11, 1995. Before that she went to a restaurant called Zum Vollmond in Schleißheimer Straße 82 with a two years younger male friend and went later to a party in Schellingstraße where they met two other friends of him. 
After the party the two left around 2am. She had to pee outside and made a remark about how she felt watched. 
She tried calling her sister while he left by Tram a bit later. 
Sonja‘s sister never received a phone call. Which would have been unusual for her anyway. There are doubts, Sonja ever went to Stieglmaierplatz. There would have been phone booths and tramstations already earlier, so they wouldn’t have needed going that far. 
Her parents never believed the story while police is sure about the events. 
Money has been lost to people who claimed knowing something about the missing daughter. 
The case was even shown in a TV show about unsolved crimes and several women called, stating a man tried to talking to them in that night in the area. 
It’s still a mystery what happened in that night. 

Police thinks there is maybe a serial murder because in 1991 a 28 year old woman called Kristin Harder from Munich disappeared in that area after a night out where she met someone new. After hanging out for a while, she moved on alone which no one could confirm. She went missing after that. 
In April 1992 on of her legs was found, previously frozen. In summer on of her arms was found, also previously frozen. A bit later an anonymous woman called the police, claiming to know the house where the woman was killed, but she never bothered telling an actual address or place. 
For a long time police considered the man she was with, was a suspect because he lied about knowing her. His sister also stated that a chain saw went missing from his garage. But a hair that was found in a trashbag containing the woman‘s leg, was not his. 

Bettina Treibhardt from Munich went also missing in 1997. The 45 year old woman was about to go out and was wearing an apparently too posh outfit for visit at a beergarden. She called a friend, leaving a  message suggesting to go there. But wasn’t at home anymore when he called back. Her remains are missing to this day. 

What do you think happened? Was there a mysterious stranger who preyed on women? It doesn’t say anywhere but maybe they were a bit tipsy, being an easy target for a lowlife.

I remember her husband would call her often at work. Apparently these calla consisted of him threatening her. It was obvious to everyone around her that her various injuries were connected to him and that he was a sadist.

Three people have been charged with the murder of a schoolgirl in Scotland 25 years ago.

Caroline Glachan, 14, from Bonhill, was last seen at about 12.15am on Sunday 25 August 1996, when she walked down Dillichip Loan towards Dillichip Bridge, in West Dunbartonshire, before then going on to a towpath.

Her body was discovered at about 4.10pm later that day in the River Leven, about a mile from her home and on what was her mother Margaret McKeich's 40th birthday.

Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Grainger, of Police Scotland's Major Investigations Teams, has now said they arrested and charged two men and a woman in connection with the death.

He said: ""I would like to thank the members of the public who have assisted with our investigation and those who have come forward with important information surrounding Caroline's death.""

Having attended the same school as Caroline and taught by the same teachers this has always been a haunting case for everyone in the area, I can only imagine how much more so for her loved ones.

I’m trying to find a mysterious disappearance/kidnapping I vaguely remember from years ago and my inability to find it is triggering me.

So I think it happened between the 50s and the 70s. Kid in question was chubby, I remember a black and white picture on which he was dressed in all white, with shorts.

He was on a trip with his parents in a RV (or a van?). A weird car was seemingly following them and eventually caused them to crash. Two strangers allegedly dressed in robes got out, took the kid and fled in the wilderness with him. Happened somewhere in Europe, either Germany or Spain. Kid was never seen nor found again. I think the parents survived the crash but like everything else about this I'm not sure.

Some details might not be 100% accurate, it’s been years since I last read of it. Does it ring any bell to anyone?

Thank you :-)

945,York_Street1,1637842847,"Last time I made a post about the infamous ""Pretzle man"" featured on Steely Dan's 3rd studio album, *Pretzel Logic*, I attracted a lot attention from many redditors. Many of them wondered who the man was in the [photo](https://www.rockshop.ro/images/product/216-steely-dan-pretzel-logic-cdjpg.jpg); many were hopeless, remarking that it was likely his name was lost to time; and others were incredibly helpful, providing source material and reposting my original post to other subreddits like users [u/AmusmentIsPending](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmusmentIsPending/) and [u](https://www.reddit.com/user/quinntronix/)/[quinntronix](https://www.reddit.com/user/quinntronix/). To put it simply, I *can* tell you that I have *not* found his name yet, *but* I *have* come across some new information as well as possible ways to identify this man that I would like to share with this subreddit.

In my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteelyDan/comments/qvi8os/who_is_the_pretzle_man_featured_on_steely_dans/) (you should go read it if you haven't), I wrote about a comment on an old forum that claimed the ""Pretzle man"" was, in fact, a real person and details about him could be found in a passage in a book called *Steely Dan: Reelin' in the Years* by Brian Sweet. At the end of my post, I asked if anyone had access to this book and if they would be willing to share the pages with me.

And they did!

[u/AmusementIsPending](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmusementIsPending/) was so kind enough to not only confirm that this passage existed, but they sent me an electronic copy of the [page](https://postimg.cc/GHBBtR7Q)!

So this is the run-down story of what happened to the ""Pretzle man"" according to the novel:

Donald Fagen and Gary Katz (Steely Dan's producer at the time) thought it would be an interesting idea to take a photograph of a pretzel vendor in NYC's central park for the *Pretzel Logic* album cover. They hired Hollywood photographer, Ed Caraeff, to take the picture, but on the weekend of the shot he couldn't make it over to NYC in time. That's where Raeanne Rubenstein comes in. Because Ed Caraeff wasn't in NYC, Steely Dan called up Raeanne Rubenstein, an NYC photographer, and asked her to take the picture instead. So she went out into Central Park probably some time in early February, snap a picture of this man, and sent it back to Steely Dan.

And here's the crazy bit.

ABC records, the record company that Steely Dan was working for at the time, asked this man to sign a release form for the photograph... and he said no! *What a major dude! Who would have the guts to stand up to a major record company like that?* Anyway, so how did the picture end up on the album cover? Well, apparently, ABC records did a profile on this guy and found out he didn't have a license to sell pretzels, so he wasn't in a legal position to argue. So they slapped his face on the album cover anyway!

Dude... *who knew that a little picture would have such an intricate back story??? Also... this sounds really illegal; I think ABC records has some explaining to do.*

Okay, so this story answers a lot of questions from my previous post... but creates a million more: What does ABC records know who this guy is? Does Ed Caraeff know who this guy is? When was this picture taken? And where do we go from here?

Well, I've put together some possible ways that I think we can use to find this man and hopefully end this mystery:

1. **Witness-** I think this is probably the most obvious one: why don't we just ask someone who was there at the creation of the album cover?The best someone we could ask is ABC records because according to the novel they actually ran a background check on this guy; it's totally plausible that they still have this guy's profile collecting dust in a box somewhere. But we shouldn't exclude people like Donald Fagen, Gary Katz (producer), Ed Caraeff (photographer), Denny Dias (band member), Jim Hodder (band member), and Jeff Baxtar (band member) because it's likely that they know who this man is. I also think that Brian Sweet is a person we would need to be asked, too, because I'm not exactly sure where he got this information for his book (anyone who has the book, could you check the sources? Maybe there is a paper trail we can follow). And sadly, we cannot ask Raeanne Rubenstein because she pasted away a couple of years ago :'(.Yeah, honestly I think this is probably the best way to get information on this guy.
2. **Permit Archives-** Even though the ""Pretzle man"" did not have a permit to sell pretzels according to the book, it may not totally be a loss cause to look through permit records. Tell me this, if you had just been written off by a major record company because you didn't have a permit to sell pretzels, and now your face is on an album cover that you never wanted to be on, wouldn't you get a permit? I'm sure that somewhere the NYCPL or LOC have permit archives dating back to the 1970s that could possibly contain our ""Pretzle man.""
3. **Photo Archives-** It could be a long shot, why not look through photos of NYC during the 70s? Maybe the ""Pretzle man"" is hiding in one of the photos in the background, and there is a valuable clue in the image.
4. **Meme Strats-** Okay, this is kind of a goofy one, but why don't we turn this guy into a giant meme? If this guy became a giant meme and everyone was talking about him. Someone could be scrolling through their Facebook feed one day, see a meme about this man, have a revelation, and say, ""Hey, isn't that my uncle Peter?"" I don't know, it could work ;P

Well, I think I'm going to end it here; I've been typing for a while now and my fingers hurt, lol.

Victoria Police has charged a 55 year old Jetstar Airways pilot, Greg Lynn, with the murders of missing campers, Russell Hill and Carol Clay, who disappeared March 2020 in the remote Wonnangatta Valley in Victoria, Australia. 

The bodies of Russell Hill, aged 74, and Carol Clay, 73, are yet to be recovered.

Greg Lynn is expected to face Sale Magistrate Court on Friday. 

Victoria Police are seeking a trailer they believed was towed by Lynn at the time of the murders that is unaccounted for. It is believed he may have sold the trailer in the months after the murders on the online marketplace, Gumtree.

The investigation was especially difficult because of the remoteness of the area where the pair vanished. 

The couples burnt out campsite was found several days after the Hill and Clay was last heard from on March, 20. Hill’s four-wheel drive was still at the campsite but with no sign of either of them.",UnresolvedMysteries,"Police charge man, Greg Lynn, with two counts of murder in relation to missing campers, Russell Hill and Carol Clay.",0

I submitted a public records request but the police department is not releasing anything stating that it is an ongoing investigation although it has been cold for quite some time. Veronica James was 25 years old when her body was found inside of a canvas duffle bag in the driveway of an abandoned home in Portland, OR. I have heard that she was killed by blunt force trauma to the head and I have heard another story that she was shot so I am not sure which one is accurate. She was last seen near the intersection of 82nd Ave. and Stark St. I did track down a comment from a bartender in the area that said that Veronica had come into the bar and seemed scared as if ""someone was chasing her"". She had 3 young daughters when she was killed and there are reports that she was allegedly involved in sex work and struggled with substance abuse issues. 

Past that, there really isn't much out there about her that I have been able to find. I know there are PLENTY of people here that are way better at research than me so I'm just hoping someone can turn up some more information and send it my way.

959,afoolandhermonkey,1637779302,"I thought the recording of her fiancé’s call to 911 had never been released to the public, but I just heard it on this week’s episode of the podcast Music City 911 (great podcast from a former 911 dispatcher who analyzes real calls). It was apparently also on an episode of another podcast that I hate and will not name.

I’ve previously leaned toward the idea that this was a suicide, which I know is a a highly controversial opinion, but have never been fully convinced. At the very least, I believe this case needs a full and better investigation. The 911 immediately raised some red flags for me. I’m no expert but have always been under the impression that giving a long lead up to the reason for the call (rather than starting off with, “my fiancée is hurt”) can be suggestive of guilt. This is what he does during the call — it feels like he is establishing an alibi. It reminds me of Darlie Routier’s 911 call where she starts off saying “ someone came in here, they broke in” rather than saying immediately that her boys are dying.

I know this is a controversial and hotly debated case but I’m curious as to what others think about the Greenberg 911 call specifically. Does it make you lean one way or another in terms of a perpetrator or whether this was murder or suicide? Should it be taken into consideration when assessing whether her fiancé had a role in her death?

963,Emergency-Bus3617,1637758060,"Hello, this is a missing person case that has always intrigued me, partially because it is a case where a child disappears but isn't reported missing until two decades later. Clearly this is a very difficult case, in that no-one knows when or where Nikole disappeared so finding any leads is nigh on impossible.

*The facts*

There is a very nice article [here](https://medium.com/crimeatorium/out-of-sight-not-out-of-mind-the-tale-of-nikole-betterson-fc30b4ab7cfe)

, that I recommend reading to get an understanding of the full circumstances, but I will also summarize the facts below:

Jarrett (sometimes spelt Jarett? it might just be a typo) Betterson, born circa 1948 (said to be 49 in 1997) had a daughter, Nikole Betterson in 1975?, with Susan Klingel. This was a relationship disapproved by Susan's parents, either due to Jarrett's race or his drug use. Jarrett was black, Susan white, and Nikole therefore mixed race.

When Nikole was two, in 1977 Jarrett crashed the car he was driving. He and Nikole survived. Susan did not.

A few months later he met Barbara Saddler and started a relationshith her. IIn December 1977, together they left Michigan with Nikole in search of a new start. Barbara promised the Klingel's (Susan's parents) that she would take care of Nikole as her own daughter.

The Klingel's never saw their granddaughter again. In 1997, when Nikole would have been 22, they decided to try and get in touch with her, believing she was now old enough to make her own decision about whether or not she wanted a relationship with them. They hired a private detective, who swiftly found Barbara and Jarrett, now married, in poverty and ill health, in Las Vegas.

There was no sign of Nikole however.

The P.I. decided to bluff and told Jarrett he knew what had happened to Nikole and that he should just confess now. Jarrett said he needed a few days and then he would tell his side of the story. He never did, however, as he and Barbara committed suicide together shortly afterwards.

Barbara sent a note to Jarrett's mother Joni Betterson (who also hadn't seen the couple in 20 years). In it she said apologised and claimed that Jarrett was about to go to jail. No mention of Nikole was made.

Further investigation revealed that, the couple had continued cashing benefit checks for Nikole until she was 18. But no one had any memory of her living with the Bettersons. In fact, the police have stated that they don't have any evidence that she ever left Michigan.

For these reasons, most believe Nikole is dead. And has possibly been dead for 20 years before she was even reported missing.

*The search for Nikole*

I've looked at a few potential Does but none have really lept out at me as good possibilities. Since it is possible that Nikole died or was disposed of along their way to Las Vegas, I think it might be good to look at what states would be passed through. I'm non-US so I've had to rely on Google Maps routes and checking what roads existed in 1977, so I don't think I'm the best at that task.

Its also possible that they took a non-standard route to get to Las Vegas. The article linked above says that they told people different plans - ""Some say the couple mentioned moving to California, others have said Nevada."". They might have spent some or most of those 20 years AWOL in an unknown state. Theres no information (that I can find) on whether Jarrett and Barbara had friends or connections to other places that they might have gone to first.

In a [previous reddit write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4dyvuc/what_happened_to_nikole_betterson_why_has_she/), user cerebral\_\_flatulence mentioned in the comments that it would be helpful to ""know which cities Nikole's father picked up her benefits cheques as a way of tracking their route, cities and timeframe, too bad that information isn't listed. Perhaps this wasn't looked at or recorded or it is a complex paper trail that hasn't been investigated fully.""

I've been doing some myheritage record looking, so I decided to use the resources there to see if I could find anything useful.

I found Barbara and Jarrett' marriage certificate. It states that Jarrett James Betterson and Barbara Gaines Saddler (Betterson) married in Clark, Nevada, USA, on Aug 28 1982. This is helpful, in that we can say they had definitely reached Las Vegas by 1982. Since they left Michigan in December 1977, this means there are just 4 years unaccounted for in regards to what state they are in. It is less helpful in that, it does not actually help.

I also found some of their residences in Las Vegas. 2 have dates attached Apr 1 1992 and June 1 1994 (both E Mesquite Avenue, just different houses). 1 has no date attached (E Tonopah Ave). Myheritage has a system where it can show you neighbours of people in the address. I haven't looked into any of them, but I guess any investigative journalists would probably be trying to interview these people. Not sure if there's any hope of them remembering a couple from 20 years ago.

Confusingly I also found another marriage certificate. This is for a Jarrett J Betterson born circa 1946 age 22 marrying Linease Hayes (Betterson) born circa 1949 age 19 in Los Angeles, California, USA in Jan 4 1968. The birth date of Jarrett is different, and I don't know why he'd be in LA but the name is very close to our Jarrett James Betterson. I can find the yearbook of a Linease Hayes studying at West High School (Denver, Colorado) in 1965. No Betterson in the year book though.

I also found a year book with a Barbara Saddler in 1969 as a junior at Midland High School (Midland, Michigan). Which was nice to see her face, but not helpful in the slightest.

*The weird thing*

There is a family tree (user created) which includes Jarrett J Betterson. The birth date given is different again 1945, but the death date is correct for our Jarrett 1997. The tree also has Susan Klingel on it. But she is described as his wife aka Susan Betterson (nee Klingel) despite them never marrying. Her death year is also correct 1977.

The user-submitted family tree also gives them a child. The child seems to be female by virtue of their name changing. There is no first name or confirmed gender as they are a private individual. They appear as &lt;Private&gt; Saxon (born Betterson) and are married to &lt;Private&gt; Saxon. They also appear to have a child (whose gender is alternatively presented as male or female on the site), who is named Taylor M\*\*\* (their full name is on the site but I wasn't sure if that is something I can share here)  and is in their 30's. Taylor is the site manager and therefore the one to create this family tree. There is no further information.

The existence of a female child to Jarrett and Susan, who lived to get married and have a kid seems pretty suspect to me. The slightly odd dates and the fact that Taylor has a completely different last name, also made me wonder if this is just a family tree made by someone interested in the disappearance. Not sure why they would do this though?

I also considered that maybe the mysterious child is a sibling of Nikole's. There is nothing to suggest that there was such a person, but I can imagine that's an easy fact to skip out on in an article if the person values their privacy. Seems odd though since the article states at the end that ""Lieutenant Peterson would like to get DNA from the Klingel’s so that if Nikole did show up, they could match it to her. As stated above, Susan’s father has passed, her mother Mary is still alive as are her two sisters."".

I have sent a very apologetic message via myheritage to Taylor M\*\*\* asking them if they were aware of Nikole's missing person case and if they knew DNA was being sought from a close relative. They haven't replied and they haven't been on site since 2016 it seems so I don't think they will ever. I feel very dubious about having sent the message in the first place, as this could be a very sensitive subject to them if they are a relative. And presumably they would already know about the case already, and be sick of question. So I'd ask that anyone else enacts a lot of caution about trying to find Taylor M\*\*\*. Which is hypocritical, but I didn't think I could write about them, without at least trying to ask them for their side of the story.

Any thoughts on anything? This is a case that I would really like to see solved. Susan's mother is still alive and Susan had several siblings - I'm sure they would like to know the fate of Nikole before they pass.

967,CrimesFromTheEast,1637704289,"In 2004, the German Handball Federation was excited to be hosting for the very first time, the Sri Lankan Handball team for a series of friendly matches between the 2 countries. These weren’t competitive matches but more of an exchange of skills &amp; the beginning of a mentorship between the 2 teams.

The Germans are credited for officially forming the sport in 1917 which is an Olympic sport so quite prestigious to be associated with a national team of the sport of course.

**The Warm Wittislingen Welcome!**

After a 10-hour flight you’d expect the Sri Lankan Team to be haggard and tired but they were delighted at having landed and had a spring in their step like explorers at a new frontier!

They were quickly put up at a hotel and were made comfortable by their German hosts who hosted a dinner in their honor. The teams got to meet each other &amp; they sang &amp; danced the night away. There were awkward gesturing and in broken words the people from these 2 countries who speak completely different languages tried to communicate. The taste of joy &amp; merriment hung in the air.

Over the next couple of days, the hosts took the team sight seeing all over the town where the Sri Lankans were introduced to the Mayor of Wittislingen.

Then came the day of their first friendly match! Right on time the Teams arrived &amp; after handshakes the referee blew on the whistle to kick off the match. It was an absolute disaster; the Sri Lankan team were playing at a level close to amateur. They were beaten effortlessly by the Germans. It was expected of the visiting team to not be of the same caliber as the home team but this was rather extreme, almost embarrassing to watch. A couple of the players certainly had some skill and were trying their best to save face but it is not a one-man sport after all and the weakness of the team was left exposed for the Germans to see.

No worries, another day another match, right? These losses would teach them valuable lessons and improve them.

After the disastrous game, the team again had a wonderful night of food, music &amp; dancing. The Sri Lankan players played drums and sang their local songs and also for some reason, a nearly unrecognizable rendition of Shaggy’s You’re my Angel.


**Going..going..gone?!**

It was day for Match #2 on September 13th 2004. Auxiliary members from the Bavarian Handball Team headed over to the hotel where the 23-member strong Sri Lankan Handball team was staying. 
Having agreed at a 7am breakfast, the German hosts waited another hour out of politeness but by 9am they were worried something may have happened to the Sri Lankan Team. 
They busted open the door to the large conference room where the team was put up, the mattresses lined up on the floor were slept in and disheveled as if left in a hurry. All the suitcases were still there, shoes, sports uniforms and gear were strewn about the room. Everything was there except the 23 men from the grand old isle of Sr Lanka!
Where had the team disappeared to? 

Worried that the men had probably gone out jogging in the woods &amp; gotten lost, the Bavarian hosts set out a search party to look for them. The Wittislingen police were notified as was the Sri Lankan Embassy in Germany.
Then someone took a closer look at the hotel room and found scrawled on a piece of paper, a strange note patched together with misspelt words which were straightforward, apologetic, grateful &amp; still somehow optimistic.

**The note** read..

*""For Every one, we want to say thank you. You are very friendly. We have decided to leave Germany &amp; travel to France. We want to find better further life. This is our own decision &amp; we will take full responsibility &amp; risk for our decision.*

*You all were very friendly &amp; nice to us. Please forgive us for our decision. We don’t have any other way right now. We cannot go back to Sri Lanka so we will go now. Please don’t worry about us we will be fine. You have done a lot for us &amp; we thank you all again."" With love, Manager (name signed)*

The entire convoy of 23 men had dispersed into Germany and could not be traced beyond the local train stations and cab stops. They had disappeared in search of a better life to alleviate themselves from the poverty &amp; civil war ridden existence back home.
The poor unsuspecting Germans were left in the lurch with broken dreams of mentoring a new team in their Home grown sport.
This whole shenanigan was nothing but a ruse right from the start!

As the Germans might say, ""Das ist das leben!"" That's life!

**Pregame Strategy**

This vanishing did not occur in a vacuum. You don’t just waltz into Europe from developing nations oh no this instance of illegal immigration was a carefully laid plan and took months to plan &amp; execute. 
The exchange program between the 2 countries was facilitated by an organization called the Asian-German Sports Exchange Program or AGSEP for short. It was started by Dietmar Doering a German transplant in Sri Lanka who came to the island nation on vacation in 1981 and fell in love making it his new home from then on.
Doering was an avid Table tennis player and started this exchange program with his home country and with the help of Sri Lanka’s government helped foster hundreds of friendly visits between the countries over various sports. Never handball though. There just wasn’t any interest in the sport in South Asia. Cricket &amp; Soccer reigned supreme in the hearts of all desi people then &amp; now.

Out of the blue, in 2003 Doering received a call from the Sri Lankan Sports ministry about inviting the German Handball team over for a friendly match. This was surprising because, Doering had never heard of a local team that played the sport. 

The ministry appointed a head coach Athula Wijenayaka who in a matter of weeks put together a rag tag group of men together as the official team.

The new head coach held practice sessions couple times a week and taught the bare minimum basics of Handball to the men. They were coached more on how to appear like they knew handball and posture as athletes. It worked because the German Team came &amp; with much fanfare an exhibition match was held. The home team was beat 2-36 which is quite atrocious but somehow, they still managed to get an invite to Germany to play matches there as is customary for the Exchange program.

And so, encouraged by yet another prospect for intercontinental harmony, Dietmar Doering committed himself &amp; the resources of his organization AGSEP into getting this trip to Germany underway. The biggest hurdle in the process was of course getting Visas from the German Embassy. 

Like I mentioned before, a brown person does not simply waltz into a non-brown country. The stamp of approval &amp; recommendation from a German national like Dietmar Doering &amp; his highly successful AGSEP foundation was a huge boost of confidence in the visa applications of these 23 men. They were soon approved &amp; the 2004 trip was planned to play 10 games over a period of 2 weeks in Wittislingen.

So these men not only bamboozled the Germans but also the AGSEP foundation &amp; the German embassy in Colombo too!
Doering suspects the head coach was mastermind behind the whole thing. However, if you think about it, there had to have been someone at the Sri Lankan Sports Ministry who either supported this plan or was hoodwinked themselves because the call to AGSEP had come from the ministry.

It’s unlikely these 23 men had the power or influence over ministers but it’s not entirely impossible. Sri Lanka is right below India on the global corruption Index charts at No. 99 out of 195 countries.

**Why though?**

On average each of those men had a family of 5 some up to 10 that they needed to support financially.
Civil war had torn the country apart &amp; limited the means of employment for many of these men. While they weren't exactly the poorest of the poor, they certainly were the brave ones who were game to risk their current freedom for future freedom.

The initial investigation had shown that most of the men had crossed into Italy.  
Why Italy? Well, there is a huge Sri Lankan population in Italy, nearly 100,000 strong!  A lot of the agricultural labor in Italy is South Asian. Some of these men had relatives already living in Italy so they just had to get there by hook or crook &amp; they would be Golden. 

The typical route from Sri Lanka to Italy would involve being locked up in a container on merchant ships for weeks, hoping to stay alive by the time to get there. 
In comparison, this handball con was like a luxury deluxe premium experience in the annals of illegal immigration yeah?

Some of these Handballers were eventually tracked down  &amp; surprisingly close to half of them had actually returned back to Sri Lanka but now had Italian Visas &amp; could easily go back when &amp; if they choose to. They revealed that they had paid around $4000 to be part of this team. That is a huge sum! 

In any case this incident marred the relationship between the 2 countries as far as the AGSEP exchange program went and no other teams were invited back since then. 

**Art imitates Life**

In 2008 a movie called Machan was made by an Italian director telling a slightly fictionalized tale of this con. 
In a fantastic twist, life imitated art when after shooting of Machan wrapped up in Germany, one of the Sri Lankan actors failed to show up at the airport &amp; illegally immigrated into Europe himself just like the characters they were playing!

In 2010 Sri Lanka finally debuted an actual legit officially stamped Handball Team at the South Asian Games in Bangladesh. No word on if they have ever faced the Germans again! The courts will be especially charged if they did or will in the future!
Game set Match!

968,TheBonesOfAutumn,1637702903,"On the morning of November 25th, 1983, the day after Thanksgiving, 54-year-old Glendora Glenn went to check on her uncle, 70-year-old Theodore “Buster” Phillips Jr. at his Muncie, Indiana home located at 825 North Brady Street. Theodore had never married and had no children, however he maintained a close relationship with Glendora and his extended family. 

When Theodore failed to answer his phone that morning, Glendora worried he was possibly injured and quickly drove the few short blocks from her home to his. However once inside she made a startling discovery. Theodore lay dead on the kitchen floor, his body riddled with stab wounds. Glendora immediately summoned police. 

It was determined that Theodore had been stabbed 24 times with a large kitchen knife. His official cause of death was determined to be blood loss from a stab wound that directly hit his heart. However, Theodore was also stabbed and slashed multiple times in the chest, shoulder, neck, groin and leg, and had defensive wounds on his hands. The murder weapon, a knife from Theodore’s kitchen, was found next to his body. Nothing appeared to be missing and the home showed no signs of forced entry. 

Theodore was known to be particularly cautious when it came to strangers. His modest home on the dead end street was outfitted with bars on the windows and multiple locks on the doors. If someone he didn’t know knocked, he would only speak to them through the locked front door, and he never allowed strangers into his home. This detail combined with the fact police found no signs of forced entry, led investigators to believe Theodore was murdered by someone he knew. 

Several people were brought in for questioning, however after providing alibi’s and taking polygraph tests, they were released and the trail went cold. Article’s about the murder continued to be published often in the newspaper however, in the hopes that someone with information would come forward. 

Just over a month after Theodore’s murder, a leadership change at the Muncie Police Department occurred. In an article published in January 1984, the new leadership vowed to make Theodore’s case a “top priority.” However this was the last article published about Theodore’s case. The case was dropped from the headlines and wasn’t again mentioned publicly until 2016. 

In the 2016 article, it is revealed that further hindering the investigation is the fact that the location of the original case file is unknown. The department's investigative unit has moved several times since 1983, and Theodore’s case file was not found among others from the same time period. 

Theodore was a World War 2 veteran, and an extremely active member of his church, however he was best known for the 14 years he spent working as a chef for a local restaurant called The Highland Cafe. Thelma and John Bragg, the owners of the restaurant, even credited Theodore for the success their business saw. 

Sadly I believe that nothing short of a confession will solve this case. Glendora appears to be the only remaining relative of Theodore’s, and she is in her 90s. However, if you have ANY information about the murder of Theodore “Buster” Phillips Jr., please contact the Muncie Police Department at (765) 747-4867.

This is a reach, shot in the dark but here goes  . My father was murdered a few years ago (2012 I think ) in Apatzingan , Michoacán Mexico . I’ve researched , googled , and tried calling places but hit dead ends .I’m honestly not even sure what I’m doing or hoping to get out of this . I do know , I need closure . Can anyone help me find what happened ? Did his murder go to jail ? Where is he buried ? 

A few years , I had a weird feeling so I started to google search and found that my grandmother had passed . This lead to me googling my father. I stumbled upon an article that said he has been shot in a public place , broad daylight . Apparently he was there for my grandmothers funeral and was killed a few days after . Moving , new phones etc , the article is lost , I can’t find it . 

I think about this almost everyday ….. when I’m eating , hanging out with my child , driving , before I go to sleep . It consumes me . I just need closure , I need to know that his killer is in prison .

Medical examiners determined she had died 2-4 months prior, likely due to homicide. She was noted to be 15-21 years old, of average build, and she had an overbite. It was not determined what race the decedent was, as she was thought to be white or Hispanic, although the possibility that she was Native American or Asian couldn't be excluded. In forensic reconstructions, she wore a distinct black and pink tube top (determined to be from Family Dollar) and jeans.

**Update:** She has been identified as Amy Yeary of Rockford, IL. Amy would have been 18 years old at the time of her death in 2008. Yeary was known to be in Beloit, WI that year when she called her mom for a ride. She was positively identified with comparison DNA from her mother, sister, and dental x-rays 

""Officials said Yeary was a victim of human sex trafficking. Detectives learned she spent time in Milwaukee, Chicago, and Beloit in the weeks preceding her death.

[Rachel Cyriacks](https://uncovered.com/cases/rachel-cyriacks) was a mother of two children from Mitchell, South Dakota and was well liked by her community. Her family described Rachel as a woman always on the go and as a daddy’s girl.  However, Rachel’s life was far from perfect. Around the time she met her husband, Brad Cyriacks, she started to experiment with drugs which eventually led to her struggling with addiction. 

In August 2013, Rachel filed a temporary restraining order against Brad. She was ready to take control and build a better life for her two children. The restraining order was later dropped as Rachel didn’t appear in court to extend the order of protection. According to paperwork, she was seeking a divorce as a result of ongoing domestic abuse but her husband was never contacted and the divorce filing was ultimately denied.

**The day Rachel went missing.** On November 11th, 2013, Rachel picked her husband, Brad, up from jail and took him home. However, it took multiple interviews before Brad mentioned this detail to officials.The following day on November 13th, 2013, Rachel was last seen in Mitchell, South Dakota at her job, Pet Performance. 

She has multiple tattoos on her body including a left neck tattoo of the name “Bradley” in black script. Rachel was last seen driving her silver and black 1995 Chevy Silverado truck with a South Dakota license plate 4CH634. [Rachel had a pink, tan and white quilt that she adored was also missing](https://uncovered.com/cases/rachel-cyriacks/timeline). Police believe that it was taken from Rachel’s home when she vanished.

**Rachel’s car is found.** On January 9th, 2014, Rachel’s damaged pickup truck was discovered by authorities with severe damage to the undercarriage. At this time, authorities believe that foul play is involved with Rachel’s disappearance.

On April 6th, 2014, Rachel’s home was vandalized. Nothing was stolen but a window was shattered, a table and light fixture was broken. There was also a message spray painted on the front of her home that read “riverside for life” and an expletive. Authorities are unsure if the spray painted message is connected to Rachel’s disappearance.

 By September 2015, the police searched for Rachel on the James River near the Huron, South Dakota area. On November 27th, 2016, police investigated a location in Beadle County with ground penetrating radar which is [“a geophysical technique that uses radar pusles to detect and image underground utilities.](https://tech27.com/resources/ground-penetrating-radar/)” This technology would allow authorities to determine if someone is buried in the ground. 

**Where the case stands today.** Law enforcement are still investigating any leads regarding Rachel’s case. The family has teamed up with a private investigator and created a Facebook page titled, “Help Find Rachel Cyriacks” and have not given up looking for Rachel. Could her disappearance be connected to the fallout of an unhappy marriage?

Timothy Scott Parry was born March 9th 1970 to Zeno and Jeanette Parry. Timothy suffers from many medical conditions such as epilepsy, brain damage, [Angelman syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angelman-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355621), and [porphyria](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/porphyria-symptoms-causes-treatment#1). He also suffers from memory loss. If frightened, he will scream and shake his hands. The porphyria meant he was sensitive to sunlight. Some sites mention he couldn't walk due to the Angelman sydrome, but an article found on [Websleuths](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/ut-timothy-parry-19-disabled-cedar-city-17-july-1989.78308/) states he may have left the area, catching a ride with someone. Timothy also mentioned to family that he wanted to start a bookstore in Las Vegas.

Oddly, Timothy had a brother named Zeno who tragically died in his sleep. He was two years older than Tim. I found an obituary on [Crimewatchers](https://www.crimewatchers.net/) that states the following:

"" Zeno Bruce Parry II, age 23, died April 11, 1991 at his home in  Enoch, Utah, quietly in his sleep.

Born  May 3, 1967 in Mesa, Arizona to to Zeno Bruce and Jeanette  LeMmon   Parry. He was a faithful member and Elder of the LDS Church. He  grew up and attended schools in Salt Lake County, Granite High, South  High and Duchesne High Schools. He loved to work with wood on knic-nacs etc. Cutting them out  and painting them in his little shop. He sold quite a few at flea markets etc. His greatest joy was to make children   happy with his train and swing ride at  church, school and community   carnivals.Survived by his parents and sister, Luann Parry and perhaps by   his brother, Timothy Scott Parry, who is a missing person since he walked away from his  home in Enoch July 17, 1989.

996,NinaSimonesGhost,1637592710,"Sorry in advance if this is already a theory that's gone around or if I've broken any rules of this subreddit (I didn't see any I might've broken, but who knows). I'm not usually into doing deep dives into unsolved mysteries or discussing them, and I do realize that this is a long shot. However, I went down a rabbit hole some time ago and ended up on \[this thread\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qmrcrm/comment/hjdbc8w/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qmrcrm/comment/hjdbc8w/)) discussing the disappearance of Teekah Lewis. I was interested, so I looked up more info, and it turns out that according to a witness's description of Teekah's probable kidnapper, his most notable characteristics were a heavily pockmarked face and long hair. I remember reading about Michaela Garecht's kidnapping some years ago, and one fact that stood out to me was that his most notable characteristics were also a heavily pockmarked face and long hair.  
From \[Wikipedia\]([https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance\_of\_Michaela\_Garecht](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Michaela_Garecht)):  
\&gt; Rodriguez, the sole witness to the abduction, described Garecht's captor as a white male in his twenties. The most distinguishing characteristic was that he seemed to have severe acne or pockmarks on his face. He had shoulder length, dirty blonde hair. He was around 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 meters) in height and had a slender build. The witness described him as having fox-like, blue eyes and wearing a white T-shirt.   
From \[a local Washington news source\]([https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/teekah-lewis-21-years-later-witness-account-could-be-key-to-solving-case-of-missing-girl](https://www.q13fox.com/washingtons-most-wanted/teekah-lewis-21-years-later-witness-account-could-be-key-to-solving-case-of-missing-girl)):  
\&gt; Det. Reopelle says the man they’re looking to identify is white, 5 feet 11 inches tall with a husky build. He’s described as having shoulder length curly brown hair with a thick mustache and a heavily pockmarked face.  
Both men are described as around the same height. In 1988, Michaela's kidnapper was described as being in his 20s. In 1999, Teekah's kidnapper was described as being in his 30s or possibly 40s. Though Miachaela's kidnapper is described as lean and Teekah's is described as husky, this would not be inconsistent with normal weight gain as one ages if they were the same person. Michaela's kidnapper had dirty blonde hair, and Teekah's had curly brown. I think given the fact that hair changes as one ages and can even look different from day-to-day and in the eye of the viewer, there is a possibility that the witnesses simply described the same hair differently. Both abductions took place on the West Coast. Both men worked alone, and both men took girls from public places with other people around and sped off in their cars, as if they didn't so much care about being seen but knew that working fast would diminish their chances of getting caught.   
I'm aware that David Misch has been charged with kidnapping and murdering Michaela. Not that I'm any kind of expert, but I'm not convinced he's the one who did it. In the current reports that compare Misch to Michaela's abductor, they leave out the fact that Misch doesn't have and never appears to have had a heavily pockmarked face, which was emphasized as a key characteristic of the abductor for many years. In fact, his skin is remarkably clear. The kidnapper was also described as having blue, fox-like eyes at the time of the abduction. Misch's eyes don't look blue to me (they look hazel or gray; someone can correct me if I'm off) and are decidedly not fox-like. Another thing: Misch's other victims were adult women. It's my understanding that serial rapists and killers usually (not always) stick to victims of similar types. While Michaela and Teekah may be of different ages and races, two vulnerable little girls are still more similar than the multiple mature/adult women that Fisch raped and/or murdered and one little girl. I also think it'possible that if the kidnapper is the same person, he may have switched to abducting black girls or girls of color because of how high-profile Michaela's disappearance was and how little attention cases involving black girls tend to receive. One last thing: the reported ""fingerprint"" used to connect Misch to Michaela is actually be a partial handprint that is so small it had to be compared manually because a computer database wouldn't accept it. Now, I'm not saying David Misch isn't a giant flaming turd who deserves to rot in jail forever, but I do think it's possible he's been fingered for a crime he didn't commit because he bore a passing resemblance to the one who did it when he was young and because he's already a violent criminal. It gives the family and investigators closure to convince themselves that they've captured the perpetrator, even if the evidence is shaky at best. But I think Michaela's kidnapper is still out there, even if my theory is silly and wrong.  
Maybe it's all just a coincidence and I'm being ridiculous, but I think it's worth asking what other people think. Again, I'm not in any way, shape, or form an expert or even skilled amateur when it comes to this stuff; I just think the (okay, admittedly weak) similarities between the two kidnappings are interesting. I'm especially interested in hearing from any folks who know more about either case and can give more details that could maybe point to a connection or that could rule it out.

997,queenofsmoke,1637591949,"I saw William Langewiesche's Flight MH370 article recommended on this sub yesterday, and since then I've devoured his work. I'm looking for more articles along the same lines - basically, well-written longform articles ideally about aviation or maritime disasters, in a vivid style. Technical information that's explained in layman's terms is a bonus. 

My favourite of his articles have been the ones about the *El Faro* sinking, *Estonia* sinking, and Air France 447 plane crash.

If anyone knows of similar writers, I'd be very grateful! I'd also be open to reading book-length works, but articles are my preferred medium. 

Here are some links to his work, if anyone hasn't encountered him yet:

998,moondog151,1637589129,"(This is the last time I do a write up on this case. I've done it twice before but I wasn't satisfied as I left out a lot of information and I wasn't very good at it back then. Unless a new development is made I will not do another write up on this case)

When this case first began in 2008 Burkina Faso was led by a military dictator turned civilian president named Blaise Compaoré, Although the country was still poor and terrorism always a possibility in the small African nation they did have some degree of political stability despite Blaise's dictatorial reign. In 2014 after a series of demonstrations and uprising Blaise would be removed from power in 2020 which plunged the country into political instability during the aftermath. In April, 2021 Blaise was also indicted by a military court for the murder of the country's former president Thomas Sankara and for ordering the death a journalist but any trial will be conducted in absentia due to Blaise being living in exile in Côte d'Ivoire.

This case takes place in The Boulmiougou District of Burkina Faso's capital city Ouagadougou, Boulmiougou is also referred to as Sector 17. Boulmiougou is located on the western edge of the city and is semi-rural and densely populated with the district most well known for its reservoir. Most of Boulmiougou's residents work in markets, gardening, growing vegetables and salad greens on small plots.

This case sadly lacks a timeline or complete list of victims which means the circumstances of the crime and name of some of the victims are unable to be located online. What is known however is that this case starts in December, 2008 with the first murder but details about this murder are sadly unknown.

The MO for the crime is known however as the killer would target night watchman, guards or people sleeping in their homes and would kill them with the weapon not being the same every case with the murder weapons ranging from crowbars, cutters, pickaxes, axes, wood, iron bars or stones found off the ground but the ax and stones would be the most popular murder weapon utilized by the perpetrator or perpetrators. In order to taunt and confuse police/investigators the killer would also discard the murder weapons leaving them at the scene for the police to find. This is how the killer was nicknamed ""L'homme à la hache"" as an ax was the most common item found at the various murder scenes.

Although most victims sadly don't have their names or the circumstances of their crime known and accessible online that isn't the case for all of them as demonstrated by the following.

On August 5, 2009 a driver from Côte d'Ivoire named Adama Bandé was killed by an man with an ax that was stolen from a concession. The killer broke down the door to his home before butchering him with the ax in cold blood. Nothing was stolen from his body or his home although some of his possessions such as his driver's licence were found in his backyard. He was the 6th victim.

On October 2, 2010 Marcelline Kabré a 17 year old girl was found dead in her bedroom. Her skull was crushed with a large stone, she was raped (according to some sources) and her room was ransacked. Tragically she was sleeping next to her 6 year old niece Delphine who was not woken up by the killer.

On November 13, 2010 a man named Mahamadi Nikièma was returning home after praying at the local mosque when we was ambushed. He received three machete wounds to his arm and during the struggle he received a blow to his head and had his ribs broken but his cries alerted his neighbors causing the attacker to flee. The residents then rushed him to the hospital where thankfully he managed to recover becoming a survivor of ""L'homme à la hache"".

On January 4 or 5, 2011 A night watchman was found dead next to a mosque in a pool of his own blood and like the previous victims an ax was found next to his body and nothing appearing to have been stolen. The final victim count is thought to be 15 but the number or survivors who were merely injured by the killer's attacks is unknown.

Understandably these crimes created a panic in the district with many residents refusing to go outside at night and only accepting news interviews if kept anonymous. Many of the residents fear that these were ritual murders carried out by a single individual a hired assassin in fact looking to harvest and extract the organs of his victims in order to obtain wealth.

The official theory from the police however dismisses this explanation as none of the bodies actually had any organs removed. Rather they believe that the motive behind these murders were motivated by fetishism the African belief that certain special and significant objects hold some degree of supernatural power. The police also theorized that a gang of individuals were involved. They also believed that the gang were under the influence of narcotics spefically cocaine while committing the murders

Some murders were falsely attributed to this killer such as on September 3, 2009 when a woman was found lying dead in a pool of her own blood however the police soon arrested a 35 year old woman and a friend of the victim for the crime labelling it as unrelated to the ongoing serial killing case.

Many felt as if the police were not prioritizing the case because Boulmiougou/Sector 17 was a working class neighborhood with a student in the area saying “We have never heard that such crimes are committed in Ouaga 2000 or the 1,200 housing units. I assure you that if it was in a residential area, the murderer would have been under arrested a long time ago” and the father of Adama Bandé stated that the police and courts would never respond to his constant request for updates on the murder, He passed away on July 3, 2011. Other residents however claim that the police are doing their best but that their best simply isn't enough due to Burkina Faso not having the same resources to catch serial killers as the United States and Europe. The main investigator for this case Boukary Drabo however thinks otherwise stating that they have conducted extensive patrols of Boulmiougou and that several criminals in the area were taken off the streets and that this matter was being taken seriously.

In response to the October, 2010 murder of Marcelline Kabré the residents formed ""self-defense"" squads where the residents would patrol the streets and all blow a whistle if an attack occurred and any nearby residents would rush to the scene to subdue the killer. Constable Boukary Drabo however was against this idea because the technicians lacked any technical knowledge on how to investigate and actually catch the killer and also stated that ""ill-intentioned people"" could take advantage of this system to settle personal scores by accusing someone else of being the killer. Other residents took other precautions such as a curfew prohibiting them from heading outside when it's late, Changing the locks on their doors and changing the doors themselves to be made of metal.

The police did arrest mutable suspects as well including the dismantling of two gangs who committed various murders against security guards using the same M.O and on January 6, 2011 police dismantled a gang called Saïdou dit Saïd lead by a 26 year old man with the leader being a believer in fetishism, owning axes and would consume cocaine before his crimes with him being arrested for breaking into a home and attempting to rob valuables from it.

Many of the residents however didn't believe them to be the killers and even the police refused to identify them as ""L'homme à la hache"" and rather just stated that they had a similar M.O with this case still being being considered unsolved as of August, 2011. The reason why the residents don't believe either of these gangs or individuals to be the killer is because they are confident that one of their own is the murderer and that he was attending the meetings they had to discuss the issue.

The killer appeared to have known this area well such as when he killed the last victim in early January, 2011. Very few people know of the existence of this security guard even amongst the residents so when he was murdered that is why the residents became certain that the killer must have resided in the area. Especially with how he managed to get to the last victim which required going by a wall which many thought would be impossible unless they already knew where to go with one resident saying ""Either the killer used magic or he went through the wall of the neighboring house. Again, he would have had to master the geography of the neighborhood. He would have had to identify his victim, plan and execute his move,""

After January, 2011 however the murders stopped and no one ever went to trial for the 15 murders leaving this case unsolved and providing the residents without closure.
